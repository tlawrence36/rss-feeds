      "Miles Mykkanen has come a long way since his musical theater dreams shifted to opera at Juilliard",
      "NEW YORK -- Miles Mykkanen grew up wanting to sing and dance on Broadway, but he was turned down by the musical theater programs he applied to for college. So he had to \u201csettle\u201d for studying opera at the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center.",
      "\u201cAt 18, when your sights are set on 42nd Street and then you\u2019re getting called to 65th Street, it was weirdly a letdown,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut after a few hours I kind of slapped myself and said \u2018Miles, pull yourself together.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was 16 years ago, and he has since pulled himself together to such an extent that at age 34 he\u2019s just opened the Metropolitan Opera season in a leading role in a new opera, \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.\u201d",
      "With a libretto by Gene Scheer and score by Mason Bates, the opera is based on the novel by Michael Chabon. Mykkanen portrays Sammy Clay, a Jewish kid growing up in World War II-era Brooklyn who teams with his cousin, Czech refugee Joe Kavalier, to create a comic strip hero modeled on Superman.",
      "He\u2019ll also be back at the Met in the spring in another modern opera, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho\u2019s \u201cInnocence.\u201d He plays the Bridegroom, a part he first sang in 2024 when San Francisco Opera gave the work\u2019s U.S. premiere.",
      "Mykkanen had sung at the Met before, mostly attracting little attention in small parts, though his haunting rendition of the Holy Fool in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov\u201d in 2021 drew critical acclaim.",
      "\u201cBut this season is so ideal,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cAll of a sudden my schedule came together, and I thought, my God, where did this all come from.\u201d",
      "When the Met was casting \u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d it was Michael Heaston, the artistic administrator, who thought of Mykkanen for the role of Sammy.",
      "\u201cI first became acquainted with Miles when he was still a student at Juilliard, and he immediately impressed me,\u201d Heaston said. \u201cHe is a singer who can straddle genres, that rare artist who can sing a heartfelt operatic aria in one moment and then turn on a dime to a classic tune from the American Songbook.",
      "\u201cWhen I looked at Mason\u2019s score and considered the vocal and acting demands alike, it seemed tailor-made for Miles.\u201d",
      "Mary Birnbaum, who taught Mykkanen acting at Juilliard, said she\u2019s not surprised at his sudden rise to prominence.",
      "\u201cHonestly it\u2019s what I thought he would do all along,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very American sound, and it\u2019s appealing and it\u2019s lush. But also he\u2019s bold as an actor \u2026 and he makes material look better for being in it.\u201d",

      "By coincidence, both his roles this season are people who have something to hide. \u201cThey are characters with two huge secrets that are kind of gnawing away at them,\u201d Mykkanen said.",
      "In Sammy\u2019s case, it\u2019s his sexuality and ambivalence about his attraction to actor Perry Bacon.",
      "\u201cAs a gay man myself, it\u2019s been really rewarding for me to be working on this role, thinking back to my coming out process 20 years ago now,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSammy wants to believe there\u2019s a future for him, but he keeps struggling and wondering if the world will ever get past its prejudice and accept him.\u201d",
      "\u201cInnocence\u201d deals with the lingering effects of a school shooting 10 years later, and as secrets are peeled away, the Bridegroom\u2019s role in the horrific events is gradually exposed.",
      "Mykkanen relishes the very different musical challenges the two roles provide. Saariaho\u2019s score for \u201cInnocence,\u201d he said is composed with a kind of \u201cmathematical\u201d precision. \u201cWhen I first cracked it open, it was overwhelming because of the time signatures, the key signatures. You\u2019re trying to figure out, what was she thinking, how do you put this all together?\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d written in a style that uses what Bates calls \u201csymphonic electronica,\u201d has been easier to learn. \u201cI almost feel it\u2019s starting to carve a new genre in opera,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSomething American opera has been trying to find in the last decade or so. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to stay to say it\u2019s musical theater, but at times it\u2019s very colloquial.\u201d",
      "Mykkanen grew up in the remote Ironwood region of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, where both his parents were high school band directors. Though he displayed a talent for singing at a young age, it was show music rather than opera that inspired him. When his parents found him a classical voice teacher, \u201cFor me it was a means to an end, to develop my voice so I could sing on the Broadway stage.\u201d",
      "Though his career now takes him all over the U.S. and to Europe, Mykkanen still calls the Ironwood region home. In 2019, he launched an arts festival called Emberlight that has grown into a two-month summer program of live performance, film, art shows and talkbacks with visiting artists. When he\u2019s not on site he handles logistics remotely and also relies heavily on volunteers.",
      "\u201cJust being the person who with a lot of other people behind me brings art to this region which is rural and remote \u2026 It\u2019s been one of the big blessings of my life,\u201d he said.",
      "And when he isn\u2019t performing, he returns. \u201cI have a room in my parents\u2019 basement where I store my stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m between contracts I come back here and stay with my mom and dad. \u2026 I\u2019lll call them from Amsterdam and say \u2018OK, what are we having for dinner next Tuesday when I land.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay\u201d runs through Oct. 11. Also starring are baritone Andrzej Filo\u0144czyk as Joe; soprano Lauren Snouffer as his sister, Sarah; soprano Sun-Ly Pierce as Rosa Saks, and baritone Edward Nelson as Perry Bacon. Met music director Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin conducts the production directed by Bartlett Sher.",

      "Pamela Anderson has embraced a makeup-free lifestyle at 58, attending fashion shows and film premieres with a bare face",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Pamela Anderson has nothing against makeup. It's just that she's been there, done that in her younger years. That's why now, at 58, she's attending fashion shows and film premieres with a blissfully bare face.",
      "It's a look, especially for older women, that serves to plague and perplex. Do we chase youth (and relevancy) with a full face, or do we foster radiant skin and march on makeup free?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be the prettiest girl in the room,\u201d Anderson told Vogue ahead of a recent show she attended during Paris Fashion Week. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just freedom. It\u2019s like a relief.\u201d",
      "Down here in the non-celebrity world, is it just as easy and comfortable to go makeup free? Some proponents of the look, along with style and beauty experts, weigh in.",
      "Women, particularly older women, are not universally giving up makeup, but Anderson, Alicia Keys and other celebrities who have publicly shown off bare faces have certainly inspired some to cast it off.",
      "Working women, however, acknowledge difficulties doing that on the job \u2014 especially in traditional, less creative work spaces.",
      "\u201cI do still think that there are some politics associated with it. More around feeling and looking polished,\u201d said Deborah Borg, the chief of human resources for a creative-leaning company that has roughly 25,000 employees.",
      "She said she's seen more women come into work makeup-free since COVID, and thinks the pandemic significantly altered the workplace dynamic.",
      "Borg, 49, gave up makeup four years ago, save an occasional swipe of her bold, signature red lipstick. At Dalya, a cozy clothing shop in New York's trendy Soho neighborhood, she lent herself as a model to demonstrate how to help one's bare skin glow and how to use attire and accessories to accentuate the look.",
      "Makeup artist Rebecca Robles counseled Borg and others with mature skin to think hydration when choosing products to make the most of their bare faces.",
      "Robles recommends a five-step workday routine: A gentle cleanser that doesn't strip the skin; a vitamin C serum to brighten and mitigate fine lines; a moisturizer with sun protection; a separate broad-spectrum sunscreen for an extra boost (don't forget to apply that to the ears); and a glossy lip balm for a bit of added polish.",
      "No mascara? No problem. Use a lash curler to offer a bit of pop to the eye, Robles said. And gently brush brows into place to complete the look.",
      "Find products with hyaluronic acid and ceramides, Robles suggests, and always swipe up with skincare products. Minimize tugging and pulling on the skin.",
      "\u201cWhen your skin is glowing, one thing that\u2019s really fun to keep in mind is that light reflects off that moisture in the skin and can help blur out any fine lines or enlarged pores. So it\u2019s win-win,\u201d Robles said.",
      "She advised that each product should sit for a minute or two before the next step is applied.",
      "Borg emphasized the ease of her morning routine since going makeup free. She used to spend about 30 minutes just on makeup. Now, she does hair and face in half that time.",

I don\u2019t have to do that. I can make the choice if I want to go no makeup, minimal makeup, full glam. I can have those choices,'\" she said.",
      "For her clients going makeup free, she uses a three-prong approach.",
      "First, with clothes, \"use a lot of color. I call it our filter,\u201d Tincher said.",
      "Secondly, play with texture; it determines how light will be reflected. \u201cSo if you have something more matte, that is going to create a more soft lighting on you. If you have more silk satin, like say something like a blouse, it\u2019s going to be more like a laser beam,\u201d she said.",
      "Finally, accessorize. Tincher said added touches like lapel pins, earrings and necklaces can provide a finished polish \u2014 especially if that polish is still expected at work. A considered style can offset judgments about going makeup free, she said.",
      "\u201cThink of your outfit as the big picture. When you walk in, what is the statement that it\u2019s making? It\u2019s not just about one part of you, it\u2019s your whole presence in a room,\u201d she said.",

      "Makeup, she said, \u201cfelt like prison.\u201d She stopped gradually, giving up foundation first. But still, she's not above applying a bit of mascara on special occasions.",

Filmmakers like Nolan, Martin Scorsese and others rallied to keep it going. Earlier this year, Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d helped prove the point again.",

      "The North American box office has slowed down after a strong September.",
      "Neither a Jordan Peele-produced horror nor a Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell romantic drama were enough to continue the September hot streak at the movies. After back-to-back weekends that had films majorly overperforming, first \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights\u201d followed by the anime \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Infinity Castle,\u201d the North American box office slowed significantly.",
      "Overall ticket sales were down nearly 50% from last weekend, with the holdover champion \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d edging out the newcomer \u201cHim\u201d for first place, according to studio estimates Sunday. Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d added $17.3 million over the weekend, bringing its total to $104.7 million, which makes it the highest grossing anime film ever in North America.",
      "The football horror \u201cHim\u201d opened in second place with an estimated $13.5 million in ticket sales. Universal Pictures opened \u201cHim\u201d in 3,168 North American theaters, where the audience was 52% male and 65% over the age of 25. Internationally, it earned $400,000.",
      "Produced by Peele\u2019s Monkeypaw and directed by Justin Tipping, \u201cHim\u201d is about a promising young quarterback (Tyriq Withers) who is invited to train with a veteran (Marlon Wayans) at an isolated compound.",
      "\u201cHim\u201d scored with neither critics (it carries a 29% on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audiences, who gave the film a C- CinemaScore. In his review for The Associated Press, film writer Jake Coyle wrote that the film \u201cwas made with the potent premise of bringing the kind of dark, satirical perspective that characterizes a Monkeypaw production to our violent national pastime. But that promise gets fumbled in an allegorical chamber play that grows increasingly tedious.\u201d",
      "\u201cHim\u201d was also nearly upstaged by another horror, \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights,\u201d which made an estimated $13 million in its third weekend. With a global total of $400 million, it\u2019s now the biggest film in the Conjuring universe.",
      "They are two of three horror movies in this weekend's top 10, including \u201cWeapons.\u201d According to data firm Comscore, this year that genre alone has generated $1.1 billion in domestic box office receipts, just several million short of the 2017 record driven by \u201cIt\u201d and \u201cGet Out.\u201d",
      "\u201cHorror movies have been on a bit of a hot streak,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's head of marketplace trends. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a record-breaking year.\u201d",
      "In addition to \u201cDemon Slayer,\u201d Sony had a new film this weekend as well: The original romance \u201cA Big Bold Beautiful Journey,\u201d starring Robbie and Farrell, but that fizzled with audiences, earning only $3.5 million from 3,300 locations. It also received largely negative reviews and currently has a 37% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cAudiences are selective in what they want to see,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cNegative reviews can create really strong headwinds for original films with no brand recognition.\u201d",
      "In its second weekend, \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\u201d added another $6.3 million, bringing its running total to $31.6 million. The Stephen King adaptation \u201cThe Long Walk\u201d is also estimating $6.3 million in weekend two, down only 46% from its opening. Its domestic total of $22.7 million has already exceeded its production budget of $20 million (though that sum does not account for marketing and promotion).",
      "Ron Howard\u2019s 1995 hit \u201cApollo 13\u201d played in 200 theaters this weekend for its 30th anniversary as well. It made an estimated $600,000. The 30th anniversary re-release of \u201cToy Story,\u201d now in its second weekend, added $1.4 million.",
      "Next weekend there is excitement surrounding the new Paul Thomas Anderson film \u201cOne Battle After Another,\" although his biggest hit to date remains the 2007 film \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d which made just over $76 million worldwide, not accounting for inflation.",

      "Sonny Curtis, a vintage rock 'n' roller who wrote the raw classic \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d and posed the enduring question \u201cWho can turn the world on with her smile?\u201d as the writer-crooner of the theme song to \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d has died at 88.",
      "Curtis, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Crickets in 2012, died Friday, his wife of more than a half-century, Louise Curtis, confirmed to The Associated Press. His daughter, Sarah Curtis, wrote on his Facebook page that he had been suddenly ill.",
      "Curtis wrote or co-wrote hundreds of songs, from Keith Whitley's country smash \u201cI'm No Stranger to the Rain\u201d to the Everly Brothers' \u201cWalk Right Back,\u201d a personal favorite Curtis completed while in Army basic training. Bing Crosby, Glen Campbell, Bruce Springsteen and the Grateful Dead were among other artists who covered his work.",
      "Born during the Great Depression to cotton farmers outside of Meadow, Texas, Curtis was a childhood friend of Buddy Holly's and an active musician in the formative years of rock, whether jamming on guitar with Holly in the mid-1950s or opening for Elvis Presley when Elvis was still a regional act. Curtis' songwriting touch also soon emerged: Before he turned 20, he had written the hit \u201cSomeday\u201d for Webb Pierce and \u201cRock Around With Ollie Vee\u201d for Holly.",
      "Curtis had left Holly's group, the Crickets, before Holly became a major star. But he returned after Holly died in a plane crash in 1959 and he was featured the following year on the album \u201cIn Style with the Crickets,\u201d which included \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d (dashed off in a single afternoon, according to Curtis, who would say he had no direct inspiration for the song) and the Jerry Allison collaboration \u201cMore Than I Can Say,\u201d a hit for Bobby Vee, and later for Leo Sayer.",
      "Meanwhile, it took until 1966 for \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d and its now-immortal refrain \u201cI fought the law \u2014 and the law won\u201d to catch on: The Texas-based Bobby Fuller Four made it a Top 10 song. Over the following decades, it was covered by dozens of artists, from punk (the Clash) to country (Johnny Cash, Nanci Griffith) to Springsteen, Tom Petty and other mainstream rock stars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my most important copyright,\u201d Curtis told The Tennessean in 2014.",
      "Curtis' other signature song was as uplifting as \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d was resigned. In 1970, he was writing commercial jingles when he came up with the theme for a new CBS sitcom starring Moore as a single woman hired as a TV producer in Minneapolis. He called the song \u201cLove is All Around,\u201d and used a smooth melody to eventually serve up lyrics as indelible as any in television history:",
      "\u201cWho can turn the world on with her smile? / Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile? / Well it's you girl, and you should know it / With each glance and every little movement you show it.\u201d",
      "The song's endurance was sealed by the images it was heard over, especially Moore's triumphant toss of her hat as Curtis proclaims, \u201cYou're going to make it after all.\u201d In tribute, other artists began recording it, including Sammy Davis Jr., Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Minnesota's H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. A commercial release featuring Curtis came out in 1980 and was a modest success, peaking at No. 29 on Billboard's country chart.",

Brooks.",
      "\u201cJames L. Brooks came into this huge empty room, no furniture apart from a phone lying on the floor, and at first, I thought he was rather cold and sort of distant, and he said 'We're not at the stage of picking a song yet, but I'll listen anyway,'\u201d Curtis recalled. \u201cSo I played the song, just me and my guitar, and next thing, he started phoning people, and the room filled up, and then he sent out for a tape recorder.\u201d",
      "Curtis would eventually write two versions: the first used in Season 1, the second and better known for the remaining six seasons. The original words were more tentative, opening with \u201cHow will you make it on your own?\u201d and ending with \u201cYou might just make it after all.\u201d By Season 2, the show was a hit and the lyrics were reworked. The producers had wanted Andy Williams to sing the theme song, but he turned it down and Curtis' easygoing baritone was heard instead.",
      "Curtis made a handful of solo albums, including \u201cSonny Curtis\u201d and \u201cSpectrum,\u201d and hit the country Top 20 with the 1981 single \u201cGood Ol' Girls.\u201d In later years, he continued to play with Allison and other members of the Crickets. The band released several albums, among them \u201cThe Crickets and Their Buddies,\u201d featuring appearances by Eric Clapton, Graham Nash and Phil Everly. One of Curtis' more notable songs was \u201cThe Real Buddy Holly Story,\u201d a rebuke to the 1978 biopic \u201cThe Buddy Holly Story,\u201d which starred Gary Busey.",
      "Curtis settled in Nashville in the mid-1970s and lived there with his wife, Louise. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1991 and, as part of the Crickets, into Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007. Five years later, he and the Crickets were inducted into the Rock Hall, praised as \u201cthe blueprint for rock and roll bands (that) inspired thousands of kids to start up garage bands around the world.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Robert Redford, who died Tuesday at 89, transformed the film industry with the Sundance Institute and Film Festival",
      "Robert Redford was disillusioned with the Hollywood mainstream. The Sundance Kid, who died Tuesday at age 89, knew that there were more stories out there, ones that weren\u2019t getting made into films because of the rigidity of the business. So he made something different, founding Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival as an alternative avenue for emerging filmmakers, where independence was a virtue, not a liability.",
      "Over the past four decades, the institute and the festival have given an early platform to countless young filmmakers, including Steven Soderbergh, Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Ryan Coogler, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, Nicole Holofcener, Nia DaCosta, Taika Waititi, Ava DuVernay, Rian Johnson, Gina Prince-Bythewood, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert and many more.",
      "\u201cFor me, the word to be underscored is \u2018independence.\u2019 I\u2019ve always believed in that word. That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told and I thought, \u2018Well, maybe I can commit my energies to giving those people a chance.\u2019 As I look back on it, I feel very good about that.\u201d",
      "In 2019, Redford said he intended to step back from his public facing role at the festival, though he remained the organization's president and founder until his death.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point where I can move on to a different place, because the thing I\u2019ve missed over the years is being able to spend time with the films and with the filmmakers and to see their work and be part of their community,\u201d he said at the 2019 kickoff. \u201cI don\u2019t think the festival needs a whole lot of introduction now: It runs on its own course, and I\u2019m happy for that.\u201d",
      "Redford\u2019s love affair with Utah began much earlier, on a cross-country motorcycle road trip in 1961 when he bought 2 acres of land. By 1969, with more money in his pocket from his film successes, he\u2019d purchased 5,000 acres, some of which was a mountain resort but most of the land was for wilderness preserves. He named it Sundance, after his character in \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "In 1981, the year he won best picture and director for \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d he established the Sundance Institute, a nonprofit organization and held the first filmmakers lab at the Sundance Mountain Resort, about 13 miles northeast of Provo. A few years later, in 1985, the institute took over what was then known as the U.S. Film Festival, which would later be renamed the Sundance Film Festival. The festival in the mid-80s hosted the Coen brothers \u201cBlood Simple\u201d and Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cStranger Than Paradise.\u201d",
      "The festival was really put on the map when Soderbergh premiered \u201csex, lies and videotape\u201d in Park City in 1989. A true indie, the film went on to win the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes and get an Oscar nomination, but it was its box office success that ignited a veritable indie film boom. And Sundance was where all the discoveries were happening. In 1991, the festival premiered \u201cDaughters of the Dust,\u201d \u201cParis is Burning\u201d and \u201cSlacker,\u201d in 1992, Tarantino\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs,\u201d in 1993, Wes Anderson brought \u201cBottle Rocket,\u201d and in 1994 \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d and \u201cClerks.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Robert Redford, independent art houses might not have succeeded,\u201d said Gary Meyer, cofounder of Landmark Theatre, and a former festival director at Telluride who also worked with Redford. \u201cHaving the \u2018Sundance Kid\u2019 give his stamp of approval to independent features and documentaries brought audiences to our theaters, while helping launch the careers of dozens of filmmakers \u2026 He made it \u2018cool\u2019 to see adventurous movies when they came to commercial neighborhood theaters.\u201d",
      "In 1994, the Sundance Institute also made a commitment to Indigenous filmmakers by launching a festival program to showcase Native and Indigenous films that continues to this day.",
      "The festival might get the most headlines, but it\u2019s the year-round work of the Institute that has really left a mark on independent cinema. The screenwriting and directing labs have been just as, if not more, influential in helping to launch the first films of many of Hollywood\u2019s top filmmakers over the past 40 years, under the leadership of Michelle Satter, who has helped shepherd projects from \u201cHard Eight\u201d to \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d and \u201cLove & Basketball.\u201d",
      "\u201cSundance changed the trajectory of my career,\u201d filmmaker and labs adviser Gina Prince-Bythewood told the AP in 2023. \u201cHow many of these special projects would have never seen the light of day without Michelle, without Robert Redford\u2019s vision, without this incredible place? It\u2019s actually really scary to think about.\u201d",
      "Native filmmaker Sterlin Harjo (\u201cRez Ball\u201d) said that his career as a young man was defined by Redford\u2019s support for independent cinema and supporting Native storytelling.",

It\u2019s \u201ca lot to process, going from a legacy that was alive in him to one we have to carry on,\u201d Cooper told the AP. That legacy, he said, centers on spreading the power of storytelling.",

      "Anthony Roth Costanzo, who introduced $11 tickets to Opera Philadelphia, aims to surprise audiences again with the company\u2019s new season as it celebrates its 50th anniversary",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Anthony Roth Costanzo, the man who brought $11 opera tickets to Philadelphia, hopes to keep surprising audiences during the company\u2019s new season.",
      "\u201cIt is very much opera. It\u2019s dramatic, it\u2019s cathartic, it\u2019s collaborative in interdisciplinary ways,\u201d Costanzo said of Opera Philadelphia\u2019s 50th anniversary season \u2014 the first he\u2019s been able to plan since taking charge of the financially teetering company last year. \u201cBut it\u2019s different from what your perception of opera might be.\u201d",
      "He slated a work by Rossini to kick things off, with opening night set for Friday. But instead of choosing a repertory staple, Costanzo picked the less-familiar \u201cIl viaggio a Reims.\u201d And the production will be anything but traditional: Director Damiano Michieletto has changed the original setting from an inn to an art gallery where the portraits come alive and sing.",
      "After that the offerings become even more adventurous. There\u2019s a multimedia piece by playwright Sarah Ruhl set to music by Vivaldi \u2014 including \u201cThe Seasons\u201d \u2014 and starring Costanzo, who maintains a flourishing performing career as a countertenor. Then comes a world premiere with libretto by Pulitzer-winner Michael R. Jackson and a score by 10 different composers. Another new opera follows, by Gregory Spears, in which the chorus has the starring role. Finally, bass-baritone Dav\u00f3ne Tines performs a \u201cvaudevillian rendering\u201d of a poem by Langston Hughes.",
      "\u201cAs I put all of the pieces together, I thought, how can I encapsulate this in just a few simple words,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cAnd what occurred to me was: \u2018Opera, but different.\u2019 And that is the slogan of the season.\u201d",
      "His pride in the lineup is understandable, especially given that when he took over it wasn\u2019t certain there would even be a 2025-26 season.",
      "The company was nearing bankruptcy and needed to quickly raise $4 million, he recalled.",
      "Almost immediately he instituted a \u201cpick your price\u201d policy under which people could buy tickets to any seat in the house starting at $11. (The website gives buyers a range of higher options and invites them to make a donation on top of the purchase. Season subscriptions at higher prices are also still available.)",
      "\u201cI said OK, I have to think like a venture capitalist,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to spend money to make money. Besides, he said, the old pricing system was projected to bring in only 8% of the revenue the company needed, so little was at risk from the new policy.",
      "The publicity and good will generated by the move helped the company quickly raise $7 million in donations, more than enough to retire the debt. When tickets went on sale for 2024-25, all three operas sold out within three weeks, and the season ended with a surplus of $2.4 million.",
      "Corrado Rovaris, the company\u2019s longtime music director, was on the podium for the season-opening performance last fall of Missy Mazzoli\u2019s \u201cThe Listeners,\u201d a recent work having its U.S. premiere.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing to see the reaction in the house,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBeautiful to see a full house but also to see such an enthusiastic house. Beautiful and very moving.\u201d",

      "Helen Little of New York City is one opera lover who was inspired by Costanzo\u2019s pricing initiative to help the company financially.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant idea,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the tickets only cover a fraction of the cost of an opera. But the whole point is to spread good will, bring in new people, bring in young people, people who have never been to an opera. And good will is priceless.\u201d",
      "In a good portent for the growth of the company\u2019s audience, two-thirds of those who chose the \u201cpick your price option\u201d had never bought tickets to Opera Philadelphia before, and most were under 45 years old. This year a similar percentage are either first-timers or repeats from last season.",
      "As a result of the brighter financial outlook, the new season offers twice as many performances as last, though the budget is still substantially lower than it was in 2017, when the company launched an adventurous festival format that had several different works in performance over a period of two weeks.",
      "Just how did Costanzo settle on that $11 figure?",
      "\u201cAt first I thought it should be $25,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the problem is that everywhere across the country I see \u2018tickets starting at $25\u2026\u2019 and I thought people would see that and think, Oh, yeah, you can sit up in the top balcony.",
      "\u201cSo I wanted to really distinguish it, and I thought a round number was less sticky \u2026 you don\u2019t remember $15 or $10.\u201d",
      "Marc Scorca, president and CEO of Opera America, said he\u2019s watching the company\u2019s initiatives with great interest, but he cautions that it\u2019s too soon to predict long-term victory.",
      "\u201cI appreciate that they\u2019ve jumped into this with both feet,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you need to have your back against the wall to take a bold experiment.",
      "\u201cI think the learning from it will be important not only to the company but to the field,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAnd that will probably not play out for another couple of years until we see how much of that audience becomes a bona fide public for the company or just took advantage of an opportunity to experiment with something at a low price.\u201d",

      "Although Harris earned a reputation as guarded and circumspect, the book has the tone of someone who is finished biting her tongue. She concedes mistakes, reveals frustrations and details some of the stranger moments from her race.",

      "Biden's team appeared to be in denial. Afterward, they gave Harris talking points that said \u201cJOE BIDEN WON.\"",
      "Harris wrote warmly of her partnership with Biden, but there were frosty moments too. As Biden faced calls to drop out of the race, he invited Harris to join him for a Fourth of July celebration at the White House.",
      "First lady Jill Biden pulled Harris' husband Doug Emhoff aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you supporting us?\u201d",

When one of the hosts asked what she would have done differently than Biden during the previous four years, Harris blanked on the talking points she had prepared and simply said, \u201cThere is not a thing that comes to mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cI had no idea I\u2019d just pulled the pin on a hand grenade,\" Harris writes. Around the studio, \u201cmy staff were besides themselves\u201d about how she had just given a \u201cgift to the Trump campaign.\u201d",
      "Harris wrote that she didn't want to criticize Biden or litigate any of the areas where they disagreed. But she also didn't understand how much her association with the president was holding back her candidacy.",
      "David Plouffe, a senior adviser, told Harris bluntly that \"people hate Joe Biden.\u201d",
      "There's plenty of grist in the book that could make the next Democratic convention a little more awkward.",
      "Harris wrote that Pete Buttigieg, Biden's transportation secretary and a former mayor from Indiana, was her first choice to be her running mate. He's also gay, and Harris thought it was \u201ctoo big of a risk\u201d to pick him while already asking voters to accept a Black woman as president.",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was another possibility. But Harris \u201chad a nagging concern that he would be unable to settle for a role as number two and that it would wear on our partnership.\u201d",
      "She ended up going with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but his debate performance against JD Vance left her yelling at the television screen. \u201cYou're not there to make friends with the guy who is attacking your running mate,\u201d she said.",
      "There's only one reference to California Gov. Gavin Newsom in the book. When Harris reached out to him after Biden ended his reelection campaign, he texted, \u201cHiking. Will call back,\" but he never did.",
      "Harris' brother-in-law is Tony West, a former top Justice Department official and member of her inner circle of political advisers. While Harris was serving as vice president, West put together what was known as the \u201cRed File,\u201d a collection of plans in case something happened to Biden.",
      "West argued that it would be foolish not to prepare. Harris writes that she \u201cdidn't want to dwell on such an eventuality\u201d and \u201cI left it in his hands.\u201d",
      "He kept refreshing the document as people pressured Biden to drop out, which came in handy when Biden finally pulled the plug on his reelection campaign.",
      "Harris writes that Biden was planning to wait a day before endorsing her as his successor, an idea that horrified her.",
      "\u201cIf you want to put me in the strongest position, you have to endorse me now,\" she recalled telling him. Harris prevailed, and the endorsement happened shortly after Biden announced that he was done.",
      "Campaigns can be hallucinatory affairs, and this one was full of bizarre moments.",
      "Harris writes that she warmed up for her convention speech with a professional voice coach who \u201cwanted me to stand there and emit animal noises.\u201d A little hesitant, Harris got her entire team to make \u201chums, grunts and trills\" with her.",
      "Harris also writes about talking with Trump after a second assassination attempt against him. Despite tearing into her on the campaign trail, Trump proceeded to flatter his opponent.",
      "\u201cHow do I say bad things about you now?\u201d he said. \u201cI'm going to tone it down. I will. You're going to see.\u201d Then Trump said that his daughter Ivanka \u201cis your big fan.\u201d",
      "When the call was over, Harris was left marveling at Trump's ability to turn on the charm. \u201cHe's a con man,\u201d she thought. \u201cHe's really good at it.\u201d",

      "The play \u201cArt\u201d returns to Broadway with a fresh revival and a starry cast",
      "For evidence of how high inflation has gotten, look no further than Broadway. The fancy painting at the heart of the play \u201cArt\u201d cost the equivalent of $40,000 in 1998. In a crackling new revival, it's a hefty $300,000.",
      "The painting in question is a 4-by-5-foot white-on-white work with white lines. Playwright Yasmina Reza puts it at the center of an escalating fight between three male, middle-aged friends that exposes their fault lines, leading to a night in which each are ripped apart by the others and putting a 25-year friendship in jeopardy.",
      "If $300,000 sounds like a ridiculous price for a monothematic canvas, you'll side with Marc, played with pitch-perfect exasperation by Bobby Cannavale. If the painting speaks to you, you'll be with Serge, a flinty, slightly full-of-himself Neil Patrick Harris. If you just want to hang out and not talk about the painting any more, you'll identify with James Corden's hapless Yvan.",
      "Under Scott Ellis' tight and enthralling direction and with three perfectly cast actors who seem to be having a ball at the Music Box Theatre, \u201cArt\u201d frequently erupts in laughter but still has plenty to say about friendship, power dynamics and how we get on each others' nerves. The 90-minute play opened Tuesday night.",
      "This is the first time \u201cArt,\u201d translated from the original French by Christopher Hampton and which won the Tony Award for best play in 1998 starring Alan Alda, Victor Garber and Alfred Molina, has returned to Broadway, and it feels nothing like an antique. Designer David Rockwell puts the latest three lads in an elegant gray, spare living room that reeks of chilly luxury but also has little personality.",
      "Marc believes that Serge \u2014 by buying the Modernist painting against the express aesthetic rules followed by Marc \u2014 is indicating that he has stepped out of Marc\u2019s shadow. It is for him nothing less than a betrayal. Serge finds a new intolerance and inflexibility in his friend and a hostility to things new. They both lobby Yvan to be on their side, and when he vacillates, he is declared a spineless amoeba.",

      "Cannavale's Marc is prone to outbursts and patting his friend's shoulders, less out of affection than an expression of dominance. Harris' Serge goes from needy to flinty to icy, and Corden fills his Yvan with the comedian's gift for physical comedy, literally plunging into a sofa to search for something or looking sheepish as he buttons a jacket.",
      "A highlight is a hysterical scene in which the three men, still festering their grievances, silently eat olives and drop the pits in a bowl with a loud ting. And Corden triggers a mid-show ovation after nailing a 900-word monster of a monologue that smacks of Mark Rylance doing something similar in the same theater in \u201cLa B\u00eate.\u201d",
      "\u201cArt\u201d has never been a discussion about Modern art, despite its title. The white painting is merely the playwright's way to get at microaggressions and competition among friends, and how seemingly small things \u2014 like the way one waves away cigarette smoke or the tone of a suggestion \u2014 can fester in the other.",
      "Sure, inflation has hit Broadway tickets, too, but this \u201cArt\u201d is a howl. Bring a friend.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Patti LaBelle didn\u2019t envision a six-decade career when she entered the music business at 14 years old. But 67 years later, she doesn\u2019t take it for granted, acknowledging the fragility of life.",
      "\u201cI think of my sisters who all passed before they turned 50, and so I thought that I would be one who also would \u2026 leave at a certain age,\u201d reflected the 81-year-old entertainment icon. \u201cWhen I turned 70, I said, \u2018I\u2019m still doing it.\u2019\u201d",
      "A regal celebration would be fitting for a singular act of her eminence, but to the delight of adoring subjects, there's even more fanfare to bestow. \u201cThe Queens: 4 Legends. 1 Stage.\u201d tour features LaBelle with fellow music legends Chaka Khan, Stephanie Mills and Gladys Knight, 81. The second leg of their royal concert processional kicks off Friday in Greensboro , North Carolina.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re coming to the four of us and loving what they see because we\u2019ve not stopped. We\u2019re phenomenally into what we do. There\u2019s no pretending,\u201d said LaBelle, the \u201cLady Marmalade\u201d and \u201cIf Only You Knew\u201d singer-actor, noting a tour with a collection of this much prestige is unprecedented. \u201cTo come back with the Queen\u2019s tour, it\u2019s just beautiful.\u201d",
      "The first leg of the tour \u2014 produced by Black Promoters Collective \u2014 ran from May through June.

      "A rotating stage transitions each 45-minute set into the next performance, introducing each artist to their wide cross-section of concertgoers, which often includes multiple generations: parents, grandparents and even great-grandparents. Individually, the impact of Khan, Knight, LaBelle and Mills within the music industry and pop culture can\u2019t be quantified, with fans and critics praising them for never abandoning soul music or their Black audience.",
      "\u201cI hear it all the time. You know, \u2018I was weaned on you,\u2019 from mother to grandmother on down. It\u2019s lovely to hear,\u201d Khan, 72, told The Associated Press in a joint interview with LaBelle and Mills. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can\u2019t grasp the feeling that they\u2019re feeling, but I get it \u2014 I think. And I think it\u2019s pretty special.\u201d",
      "At 17 years old, Mills originated the role of Dorothy in \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d which debuted on Broadway 50 years ago. Now, 68, the Grammy winner affectionally known as \u201cthe baby\u201d by her co-headliners, says there\u2019s no need to slow down.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in the blood. What would we do? Sit at home and not do anything?\u201d said Mills, who hopes for another Broadway stint in the near future. \u201cI was 11 my first Broadway show. So, I\u2019ve been in the business my entire life.\u201d",

      "The report attributes most of the administrative costs to the implementation of changes in determining eligibility and enrolling people, along with duplicative technology, training and coordination while the state litigated to overcome Biden administration objections.",
      "\u201cNow the entire country can see what we in Georgia already know \u2014 Georgia\u2019s Medicaid work reporting requirement program is the real waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d Sen.

      "The Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency is one of 55 organ procurement organizations, or OPOs, nonprofit agencies around the country that coordinate the recovery of organs from deceased donors and help match them to patients on the nation\u2019s transplant waiting list.",
      "The administration cited an investigation that found a 2024 case where an unspecified mistake led a surgeon to decline a donated heart for a patient awaiting surgery.",
      "In a news briefing, Dr. Mehmet Oz, who heads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said problems included would-be donations that went unrecovered, sending some donated organs to the wrong place and a lack of staff.",
      "Life Alliance, a division of the University of Miami Health System, can appeal the decision. If it is shut down, it would mark the first time the federal government has decertified an OPO.",
      "Life Alliance didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "More than 100,000 Americans are on the transplant list and thousands die waiting because there aren\u2019t enough donations to go around. Last year there were more than 48,000 transplants, a record, the vast majority from deceased donors.",

      "A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta for two days this week to consider various vaccine recommendations",
      "NEW YORK -- A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta this week to consider whether to revise recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B, and a combination shot that protects children against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.",
      "The panel, which is charged with making vaccine recommendations, declined to recommend COVID-19 vaccines, saying instead that people could make individual decisions \u2014 a move that adds confusion as people weigh whether to get a dose this fall.",
      "During the sometimes chaotic two-day meeting, the panel also recommended new restrictions for a vaccine that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. In a surprise move, the group indefinitely postponed an expected vote on hepatitis B shots given to infants on the day they are born.",
      "With Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, leading the country's health agencies, the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, struck a different tone from past gatherings. Among the 12 members, all chosen this year by Kennedy after he fired the previous 17-member panel, are people who have criticized and spread misinformation about vaccines. Critics say the panel's makeup and agenda could sow distrust in the shots.",
      "The panel's recommendations will be sent to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that has been rocked by disagreements over Kennedy's vaccine policies. The panel's recommendations are usually adopted by the CDC, and then widely followed by doctors and insurers.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the meeting.",
      "The panel on Friday debated COVID-19 vaccinations as the virus has remained a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths last fall and winter, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the vaccinations had been routinely provided to nearly all Americans who wanted them. The Food and Drug Administration recently put new restrictions on this year\u2019s shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, reserving them for people over 65 or younger ones who are deemed at higher risk from the virus.",
      "Panelists declined to recommend the shots for anyone, including seniors and high-risk populations. They said individuals could make their own decisions. Removing the recommendations that were previously in place may confuse Americans trying to decide whether and how to get their fall boosters.",
      "The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks, despite pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record from the billions of doses administered worldwide.",
      "The divided panel narrowly avoided urging states to require a prescription for the shot.",
      "Several states have announced policies to try to ensure people's access to COVID-19 vaccines, worried about Friday\u2019s ACIP decision. And a group representing most health insurers, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said earlier this week that its members will continue covering the shots through 2026.",
      "The committee recommended that a combined vaccine known as MMRV should not be given to children under 4. Instead, they said in an 8-3 vote with one abstention, children in this age group should get separate vaccines \u2014 one for MMR and another for varicella, or chickenpox.",
      "Their discussions centered on rare feverish seizures that can occur in kids who receive the first dose, between the ages of 1 and 2. Medical experts agree these seizures, while potentially frightening for families, are not linked to brain function or school problems.",
      "In 2009, the ACIP changed a previous recommendation to advise that either the combination shot or separate shots were acceptable for the first dose.",
      "Some doctors and public health experts say they are not aware of any new safety data that would explain the revisiting of those vaccination recommendations.",
      "About 85% of children already receive separate doses for the first round, according to information presented at the meeting.",

      "But experts have raised concerns that other kids could have a hard time getting the combination vaccine as a result of the panel's recommendation. Government insurance programs like Medicaid, for example, would have to stop paying for the early combo dose if the acting CDC director accepts the panel's guidance.",
      "Ever since the ACIP panel in 2005 recommended a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, cases of the liver virus among infants have dropped by more than half.",
      "Nonetheless, the committee opted to revisit the guidance in this week's meeting, with members questioning whether babies born to moms who test negative for hepatitis B really need a vaccine at birth.",
      "The panelists considered whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination \u2014 something doctors and parents already can choose to do.",
      "One committee member asked if the vaccination right after birth was \u201casking our babies to solve an adult problem.\u201d Hepatitis B can spread through sex, sharing needles, or from an infected mother to a newborn baby.",
      "But several outside medical experts criticized that the committee was debating the issue at all and said the vaccine is safe and successful at reducing infant infections.",
      "After discussing it on Thursday, the panel decided Friday morning to indefinitely postpone a vote on the issue.",
      "Chairman Martin Kulldorff opened the meeting by challenging former CDC directors to a public debate. Several doctors representing outside medical groups accused the panel of not following the CDC\u2019s long-established guidelines in weighing evidence for making recommendations.",
      "CDC staff, as usual, presented numerous studies on the topics being debated, explaining how they chose which research to discuss. But a few times, panel members cited different papers they had found, including ones done in mice, which are not generally considered applicable.",
      "The committee also took a vote on Thursday that they had to redo on Friday morning concerning the government\u2019s Vaccines for Children program, which covers vaccine costs for about half of U.S. kids. On Friday, they voted to align coverage under the program with their guidance on MMRV shots. A day earlier, they had voted no on the idea.",
      "\u201cWe are rookies. \u2026 There are many technical issues that we might not grasp as of yet,\u201d Kulldorff said. He said a committee member had told him that \u201cmaybe we didn\u2019t quite understand what was going on\u201d with the vote.",
      "At one point Thursday, one of the panelists appeared to be napping, with his eyes closed and his chin resting on his chest.",
      "Doctors and public health experts watching the meeting unfold said they are concerned that the committee is creating fear and mistrust around vaccines at a time when U.S. vaccination rates are already falling.",
      "They suggested the new panel was selectively using its recommendations to justify specific conclusions, rather than considering all the evidence.",

      "Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party has opened the official campaign to replace its leader, outgoing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba",
      "TOKYO -- Outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba \u2019s ruling party opened official campaigning Monday to find his replacement who can restore political stability and voter support for the beleaguered Liberal Democrats.",
      "Five candidates are vying for the Liberal Democratic Party's top job ahead of a highly unpredictable vote in early October. The race has a slogan: \u201cChange, LDP.\u201d",
      "The winner must act quickly to address rising prices if the party is to have any chance of winning back support following devastating losses to both the LDP and its junior partner Komeito in the past year that deprived their coalition of a majority in either house of parliament.",
      "Its new leader is still likely to be prime minister because the LDP remains the No. 1 party, while opposition groups are too splintered to form a coalition.",
      "Whoever becomes the LDP leader must also gain cooperation from main opposition parties or risk facing constant no-confidence motions and a cycle of short-lived leadership.",
      "The Oct. 4 vote is not open to the general public. It is limited to 295 LDP parliamentarians and nearly 1 million dues-paying grassroots party members. That\u2019s less than 1% of Japan's eligible voters.",
      "A candidate who secures a majority becomes a party leader. If nobody wins a majority, there will be a runoff between the top two candidates in the first round.",
      "To be elected as prime minister, the new party leader will need votes from some opposition lawmakers in a parliamentary leadership vote, to be held within days.",
      "All five candidates are incumbent and former Cabinet ministers. They call themselves moderate conservatives as they emphasize their willingness to work with opposition groups. At Monday's joint kick-off event, the candidates largely focused on the economy and stricter measures on immigration. Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi and former economic security minister Sanae Takaichi are considered the top contenders.",
      "Here's a rundown of the candidates:",
      "Shinjiro Koizumi, 44: The son of a popular former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, makes his second bid after running against Ishiba last year when he campaigned to reform the scandal-laden party. As agriculture minister for Ishiba, Koizumi released an emergency rice stockpile to lower prices and stabilize supply. Koizumi vowed to rebuild his party and listen to the people's voices more closely to address their concerns, such as rising prices, growing foreign population and public safety, but stayed away from divisive issues. If elected, he will be Japan's youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who in 1885 became the first Japanese premier at 44.",

A wartime history revisionist and China hawk, she regularly visits the Yasukuni Shrine seen by Beijing and South Korea as a symbol of militarism. She supports more public spending and investment for growth and a strong military. She backs paternalistic family values and opposes a female emperor, as well as a revision to civil law to allow an option of keeping separate surnames for married couples \u2014 a change sought by rights groups so that women aren't pressured into abandoning their names.",
      "Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64 : Chief Cabinet secretary of Ishiba's government, Hayashi is a moderate who promises steady wage increases, a strong economy and defense. He has served in a number of other key Cabinet posts, including foreign, defense and education ministers. The Harvard-educated politician is fluent in English. He sings and plays the guitar and piano in a pop band Gi!ns, which he formed with three fellow parliamentarians to make politics approachable.",

Motegi said the Japan-U.S. alliance is key to his country's diplomacy and that deepening the \u201crelationship of trust\u201d with Trump is essential.",
      "Takayuki Kobayashi, 50 : A former economic security minister who promises strong growth, defense and national unity, Kobayashi is ultra-conservative and may split votes with Takaichi. Nicknamed Koba-Hawk, he promises a tougher restrictions on foreign workers and says Japan's defense spending target of 2% of GDP is insufficient.",
      "If elected, Takaichi, an ex-newscaster whose role model is former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, will be Japan's first female prime minister. The country ranks near the bottom internationally for gender equality, especially in politics.",
      "Some experts worry that the hardline conservative would set back women\u2019s advancement. Others say her revisionist views of Japan's wartime history may complicate ties with Beijing and Seoul.",
      "In a policy speech on Friday, Takaichi said she wants good ties with China, as an important neighbor and that her harsh comments about China are mostly related to economics. She did not say she would visit Yasukuni if she became prime minister, but stressed her \u201cgratitude\u201d for those who sacrificed their lives for the country and are enshrined at Yasukuni.",

      "If the execution goes through, Datchinamurthy Kataiah, 39, will become the third Malaysian national and the eleventh person to be hanged this year in Singapore.",
      "His family received a notice on Sunday that his hanging will take place on Thursday at Singapore's Changi prison, according to Kokila Annamalai of the Transformative Collective Justice, which advocates for abolishing the death penalty in Singapore.",
      "Datchinamurthy was arrested in 2011 and later convicted of trafficking about 45 grams (1.6 ounces) of heroin into Singapore. He was to be hanged in 2022 but won a last-minute reprieve pending a legal challenge that was dismissed by the court in August.",
      "Singapore\u2019s strict laws mandate the death penalty for anyone caught carrying more than 15 grams of heroin and 500 grams of cannabis. Critics say the law disproportionately targets low-level traffickers and couriers.",
      "Speaking at a joint news conference via video link with Amnesty International Malaysia and the Anti-Depath Penalty Asia Network, Kokila read from a letter from Datchinamurty\u2019s sister, Rani, who has flown to Singapore to spend time with him.",
      "Her brother is not protesting punishment, Rani said in the letter, but believes the death penalty is \u201ctoo harsh and extreme for a young man\u2019s naive action.\u201d",
      "The three rights groups and 30 other civil society organizations also issued a joint statement reiterating standing calls to halt executions. They said three other Malaysians and a Singaporean man, who had been on death row for drug offenses ranging from 7 years to 10 years, face executions after recently losing their latest appeals.",
      "The Cabinet of Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who took office last year, had advised President Tharman Shanmugaratnam to show clemency to a Singaporean man on death row for drug trafficking.",

      "Conservationists mark world rhino day on Monday while they are still in a constant battle against poaching",
      "DINOKENG GAME RESERVE, South Africa -- The Dinokeng Game Reserve in South Africa has a thriving rhino population, but their exact numbers and the details of the security operation that keeps them safe from poaching are closely guarded secrets.",
      "They are the protocols that reserves with rhinos follow to ensure they're not the next target for poachers who still kill on average one rhino every day in South Africa for their horns despite decades of work to save the endangered species.",
      "South Africa has the largest populations of both black and southern white rhinos of any country and sees itself as the custodian of the animals' future.",
      "As conservationists mark World Rhino Day on Monday, South Africa remains in a constant and costly battle against poaching nearly 30 years after black rhinos were declared critically endangered, and more than a half-century since southern white rhinos were on the brink of extinction with just a few dozen left.",
      "South Africa has more than 2,000 of the 6,700 black rhinos left in the wild or in reserves and 12,000-13,000 of the world's 15,000 remaining southern white rhinos, which are now listed as near threatened after a turnaround. Those two species are only found in the wild in Africa. South Africa has a pivotal place in saving them but also is the epicenter of rhino poaching that is linked to organized crime.",
      "South Africa's rhinos are spread between government-run parks and private owners like Dinokeng.",
      "The country has made marked progress in the last decade with that public-private collaboration, bringing the number of rhinos killed by poachers from well over 1,000 every year to 420 last year. Yet, 195 rhinos were killed by poachers in the first half of this year, according to the South African Environment Ministry, still one every day.",
      "\u201cPlease do not tell a ranger that we\u2019re not going to win this war,\u201d said Marius Fuls, a wildlife monitor and ranger at Dinokeng. \"If we as conservationists stop believing that we\u2019re going to win this, then we have lost it. We\u2019re the last thin green line between the extinction of rhinos.\u201d",
      "In South Africa and elsewhere, anti-poaching efforts now employ high-tech tactics to help rangers. Reserves are using drones, night surveillance equipment, radar technology, motion-sensing cameras and artificial intelligence. Rhinos at Dinokeng are fitted with tracking devices so rangers know where they are. Rangers also patrol with K-9 dog units.",
      "Dinokeng has been successful in protecting its rhinos, but there is no letup. \u201cIt would be naive to think that poaching is not a threat even though we haven\u2019t had incidents in many years,\" Fuls said. \"Poaching is always a threat.\"",
      "Some reserves continue to dehorn their rhinos to make them useless to poachers who kill them because of the high demand for rhino horn products for medicinal and other uses in parts of Asia. Studies indicate that rhino horn products sold through illegal markets sometimes fetch higher prices than gold.",
      "The fight against poaching is always looking for new ways to stop rhinos being killed. This year, a group of scientists in South Africa working with the International Atomic Energy Agency launched a program to inject small amounts of radioactive material into rhinos' horns. The aim is to make them unsellable, but also detectable if they are smuggled through borders.",
      "The scientists said the radioactive material does not harm the rhinos.",
      "Conservationists are also moving rhinos to new areas in a repeat of South Africa's famous Operation Rhino of the 1960s. That operation was a reaction to the drastic situation of southern white rhinos, which were nearly extinct. It moved some of the last remaining white rhinos in eastern South Africa to other areas so they could be better protected and establish new breeding populations. It is credited with saving the southern white rhino.",

      "\"It's been an incredible success story,\" said Gillian Rhodes, combating wildlife crime program manager at Peace Parks Foundation. But she added rhino poaching rates are still \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "Similar success in rhino conservation is reported elsewhere in Africa.",
      "The east African nation of Uganda on Monday held its first-ever ceremony to name 17 rhino calves at a sanctuary, an event the head of the country's wildlife agency described as \u201ca powerful statement that Uganda has chosen restoration over despair and resilience over loss.\u201d",
      "Rhinos were hunted to extinction in Uganda, but the species was reintroduced in 1996 and the country is now home to 50, said James Musinguzi, executive director of the Uganda Wildlife Authority.",
      "World Rhino Day was started in 2010 to raise awareness of the threat of poaching and habitat loss for all five of the world's rhino species. The other three, which are found in Asia, are in an even worse predicament. There are just over 4,000 greater one-horned rhinos, only around 50 Javan rhinos and less than 50 Sumatran rhinos left, according to the International Rhino Foundation's latest count.",

      "Defense lawyers in the Holy See\u2019s \u201ctrial of the century\u201d have asked the Vatican prosecutor to recuse himself from the appeals trial",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Defense lawyers in the Holy See's \u201ctrial of the century\u201d asked the Vatican prosecutor to recuse himself from the appeals trial Monday, arguing he was implicated in questionable behavior according to years of private WhatsApp messages that have shaken the proceedings.",
      "The chats show Prosecutor Alessandro Diddi has a personal interest in the outcome that should preclude him from heading the prosecution, the lawyers said in separate motions on the opening day of the appeals trial.",
      "The tribunal president, Archbishop Alejandro Arellano Cedillo, accepted the motions and ordered Diddi to respond within three days, underscoring how the chats have shifted the ground under the Vatican\u2019s most ambitious and high-profile prosecution of alleged financial misconduct.",
      "The trial concerning the Vatican\u2019s 350 million euro ($412 million) investment in a London property resulted in the 2023 conviction of nine people on a host of finance-related charges. The star defendant was Cardinal Angelo Becciu, once a close confidante of Pope Francis and a future papal contender.",
      "The investigation took a crucial turn in August 2020 when the prime suspect in the London deal, Monsignor Alberto Perlasca, changed his story and turned on his onetime boss, Becciu. Perlasca escaped indictment and became a prime prosecution witness; Becciu was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to 5 1/2 years.",
      "Recently, thousands of pages of WhatsApp texts and audio messages have provided the backstory to Perlasca\u2019s change of heart. They suggest questionable behavior by Vatican police, Diddi and Francis himself.",
      "They document a behind-the-scenes effort by two women, Francesca Chaouqui and Genevieve Ciferri, to target the cardinal by persuading Perlasca to turn on him. While the claims are unverified, the defense has seized on them as evidence that the investigation was contaminated from the start and the defendants couldn\u2019t get a fair trial in the Vatican, an absolute monarchy where Francis intervened on behalf of prosecutors.",
      "The chats \"demonstrate a disturbing activity of evidence tampering,\u201d the lawyers wrote, citing various instances in which it appeared Chaouqui was in close contact with Diddi's office and provided Perlasca with advice purportedly from investigators.",
      "The existence of the messages first jolted the trial in 2022 when Diddi told the court that Ciferri had forwarded him 126 chats she exchanged with Chaouqui. Diddi entered the messages into evidence but redacted all but eight, prompting defense complaints that he was withholding crucial evidence.",
      "The additional chats now circulating show Diddi had more than 126 chats in 2022 and that Ciferri continued forwarding him content for four days. Diddi had said he blocked her after the first night. Diddi also said he didn't know either Ciferri or Chaouqui.",
      "The defense lawyers also cited an audio file suggesting Vatican Police Commissioner Stefano De Santis gave Chaouqui advice for Perlasca about how to implicate others when he was still a suspect. After Perlasca changed his story, he not only escaped prosecution but was listed as an injured party in the trial and became a prosecutor in another Vatican court.",

      "During Monday\u2019s hearing in a frescoed courtroom in the Apostolic Palace, Diddi thanked the defense for providing the opportunity to respond to the allegations and said he would take the three days to \u201cexpress my thoughts calmly, in order to dispel the doubts that have arisen in recent months about the conduct of the investigation.\u201d",
      "He then left the tribunal and other prosecutors took over.",
      "If Diddi doesn\u2019t recuse himself, the matter will go before the Vatican high Court of Cassation headed by American Cardinal Kevin Farrell, a Francis protege and appointee.",
      "In his role as camerlengo, Farrell reportedly produced a letter from Francis after his death making clear the late pope didn\u2019t want Becciu to participate in the conclave to elect his successor.",
      "Chaouqui is now under investigation by Italian and Vatican prosecutors for alleged influence-peddling for her role in Perlasca\u2019s changed testimony. The investigation considers Diddi a victim of the scheme, which is the basis for the defense argument that Diddi has a personal stake in the related appeals case and shouldn't prosecute it.",

      "In opening remarks, a lawyer for Machar opposed the trial by what he described as \u201can incompetent court\" that lacks jurisdiction.",
      "The defense argued Machar cannot be criminally charged without hurting the spirit of a 2018 peace deal between Machar and Kiir to end a deadly civil war that caused an estimated 400,000 people. That agreement is the basis for the transitional government in which Machar has been serving as first vice president.",
      "Defense attorneys said the agreement effectively governs South Sudan, which has been on the brink of a return to full-blown war as government forces battle armed groups believed to be loyal to Machar.",
      "They argued Machar remains the country's vice president under the provisions of the 2018 agreement, which was negotiated with the help of regional leaders and others in the international community.",
      "The proceedings were then adjourned until Tuesday.",
      "Kiir and Machar were leaders of the rebel movement that secured South Sudan\u2019s independence from Sudan in 2011. They are from rival ethnic groups: Kiir is from the Dinka, the largest, and Machar is from the Nuer, the second-largest.",

A former shopping mall and ice rink, the building has been overhauled into an ultramodern digital center that has led the rescue of the nation\u2019s ailing finance and tax sector.",
      "It is teeming with inspectors who chase down tax cheats with the help of drones, big data and live surveillance feeds from as far as Greece\u2019s island ports and remote farming villages.",
      "Analysts at the Independent Authority for Public Revenue monitor millions of transactions in real time and order stings on businesses flagged by algorithms for a high potential of illegal activity. The high tech was on full display during a recent visit as The Associated Press was granted rare access to the authority\u2019s headquarters.",
      "Greece\u2019s tax system \u2014 once a byword for inefficiency \u2014 has been rewired by technology.",
      "Now, the country that spent nearly a decade as Europe\u2019s financial outcast, drowning in debt, has become one of its best budget performers, with bonds restored to investment grade by all major ratings agencies.",
      "\u201cWe worked systematically over the years, with dedication,\u201d Giorgos Pitsilis, governor of the revenue authority, told the AP. \u201cWe started from a situation of no data to a situation with big data.\u201d",
      "Greece was one of just six EU member states that recorded a budget surplus in 2024, after running deficits for decades. Momentum carried into this year, with government revenues shooting past targets through August.",
      "Moody\u2019s upgraded Greece\u2019s bonds to investment grade in March, praising its large-scale push to digitize the tax system. Jason Graffam, senior vice president at ratings agency Morningstar DBRS, noted that Greece\u2019s long-term borrowing costs now sit slightly above Spain\u2019s \u2014 and below Italy\u2019s and France\u2019s.",
      "\u201cThe Greece of today is indeed very different from a decade ago,\u201d Graffam said. \u201cThere has clearly been durable change to the country\u2019s economic model and its fiscal regime.\u201d",
      "During the crisis years, international creditors imposed punishing austerity measures in exchange for three massive bailout packages. Greece's population felt the pain deeply \u2014 wages were slashed, companies shut down and the economy bled jobs.",
      "Sustained pressure from lenders forced successive governments to modernize one of Europe\u2019s weakest tax systems.",
      "Out went paper files and fax machines. In came cashless, paperless systems powered by algorithms that scour card payments, tax filings, payroll data, customs declarations and bank records \u2013 and flag anomalies for inspectors to pursue.",
      "Repurposed smartphones carried by inspectors in the field stream video and audio back to headquarters. There are panic buttons to use when someone feels threatened.",
      "Back at headquarters, screens map ongoing site inspections and drone surveillance feeds from multiple sites: from restaurants and ports to hidden grain silos and fruit delivery trucks \u2014 even live readings from ships\u2019 fuel tanks.",
      "Tax and customs officials described how the data translates into raids. They spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of their work and citing reasons of personal safety.",
      "During a recent nightclub sweep dubbed \u201cSaturday Night Fever,\u201d they matched individual table orders against receipts to uncover undeclared sales, mostly of alcoholic drinks.",
      "\u201cWe knew the tables were full, but the receipts didn\u2019t match,\" one official said, adding that after inspectors showed up, the nightclub's reported revenues doubled within days.",

      "\u201cCountries change when they change course,\" he said at a news conference this month. \"And that change means we won\u2019t be left behind or ever return to the past.\u201d",

      "Vietnamese singer Duc Phuc was crowned the winner of the newly revamped Intervision song contest \u2014 a Russian answer to Eurovision that some say is as much about politics and power as it is about performance",
      "When Vietnamese singer Duc Phuc held aloft the crystal cup trophy in Moscow\u2019s Live Arena on Saturday night, he became the inaugural winner of new song contest Intervision \u2014 a Russian answer to Eurovision that some say is as much about politics and power as it is about performance.",
      "In a show overflowing with thundering vocals and pyrotechnics, Duc Phuc's song \u201cPhu Dong Thien Vuong,\u201d a heady mix of pop, rap and dubstep, saw off second-place Kyrgyzstan to take home the grand prize of 30 million rubles (about $360,000).",
      "The final also brought the unexpected. Moments before the U.S. entrant, Australian-born Vassy, was due to take to the stage, the show's presenters announced that she would not be able to perform due to \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d from the Australian government. Another act, singer-songwriter Brandon Howard, had been slated to perform for the U.S. until three days before the final show. He ultimately dropped out due to \u201cunforeseen family circumstances.\u201d",
      "Vassy told the Associated Press that she was not able to currently comment on the incident.",
      "Then, as Russian singer Shaman finished his act, he delivered a passionate speech asking for Russia's performance not to be considered by the international jury.",
      "\u201cRussia has already won by inviting so many countries to join us,\u201d he said.",
      "For decades, the sequin-encrusted pinnacle of international music competitions has been Eurovision \u2014 the European Broadcasting Union\u2019s continent-spanning celebration of song. Intervision wants to claim that crown. Much like Eurovision, the contest sees acts perform under their national flag in front of thousands in a bid to win votes and glory.",
      "But beneath the glitter, geopolitics bubbles. Signed into life by special presidential decree in February \u2014 three years after Moscow was barred from Eurovision for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine \u2014 the Russia-hosted Intervision gives Moscow a self-built platform back on the global cultural stage.",
      "Kremlin officials insist that Intervision is not an example of Russian soft power. \u201cWhat we are doing is diametrically opposite to the attempts to use sports, art, and any other human activities for political gains,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told journalists in a pre-contest press conference.",
      "Yet high-level Russian politicians have been consistently linked to promoting Intervision. President Vladimir Putin discussed the contest during his state visit to China at the start of September and recorded a special video message screened before the show began. Lavrov also appeared at the show, holding an interview between the first and second acts.",
      "The competition\u2019s importance in showing a Russia that has been embraced, not ostracized, by the world at large, despite its 3\u00bd-year war, is impossible to avoid.",
      "\u201cEurovision pales in comparison to Intervision,\u201d lawmaker Leonid Slutsky told Russian state news agency Tass. \u201c(It) destroys the myth of Russian isolation.\u201d",
      "Intervision is modeled after a socialist-era contest of the same name hosted in Czechoslovakia between 1965 and 1968, and Poland between 1977 and 1980. Although the 2025 Intervision has been hailed as a revival, the competitions never sparked much interest in Soviet Russia, says historian Dean Vuletic, author of \u201cPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.\u201d",
      "Czechoslovak and Polish television \"saw Intervision as a bridge between East and West,\u201d Vuletic says. \u201cThey wanted to attract the attention of Western media, Western record companies.\u201d",
      "Foreign artists also used Intervision to build their global profile. Boney M famously featured as an interval act in 1979, where they performed their hit \u201cRasputin.\u201d",
      "In 2025, there are still plenty of artists ready to embrace a global audience, although most of the performers involved are from countries that take at least a neutral stance to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",

In its rules, Intervision says that co-organizers \u2014 the legal entity in charge of nominating acts, organizing broadcasts and promoting the contest in its home country \u2014 can range from national broadcasters to individuals, but there\u2019s no public list to confirm who these co-organizers are.",
      "As a result, some performers outweigh others for cultural clout, despite Intervision\u2019s stipulation that all acts should be a \u201cnational star.\u201d Russia\u2019s entry, the ultra-patriotic Shaman, is one of the country\u2019s most heavily promoted acts.

And some of the songs are fantastic.\u201d",
      "But most Eurovision fan communities have ignored Intervision entirely. \u201cLet the dictators and war criminals have their own little party where they can spout their propaganda and call it a contest,\u201d read one comment on a popular Eurovision Reddit forum.",
      "Aside from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Intervision has also made a public commitment to \u201ctraditional universal and family values\u201d \u2014 an affront to many fans of the LGBTQ+-friendly Eurovision. Information about Vassy's role as an ambassador for the NOH8 Campaign, a nonprofit promoting LGBTQ+ rights and gender equality, disappeared briefly from her Wikipedia page after her participation in the contest was announced. It was later restored.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear just how much interest Intervision will be able to command in Russia. The AP found several advertisements on online casting websites offering a small payment for anyone who would join the Intervision crowd.",
      "Without a fan base or a central organization driving the competition onward, Intervision\u2019s future will depend on political will. That\u2019s risky, says historian Dean Vuletic. Both the Czechoslovak and Polish iterations of Intervision of the 1960s and 1970s ultimately fizzled due to social upheaval and changing political priorities.",
      "As the 2025 show drew to a close, organizers announced that next year's Intervision would be held in Saudi Arabia.",

      "\u201cIn Soviet times, the party and government made decisions to promote a positive image of Russia abroad. Today, we must advance an objective portrayal,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cIndeed, some of our perceived shortcomings provoke envy among many foreign counterparts.\u201d",

      "Vote counting was underway in Guinea in a referendum on a draft constitution that could allow the junta leader to run for the presidency",
      "CONAKRY, Guinea -- Vote counting was underway in some polling stations in Guinea Sunday evening in a referendum on a draft constitution that could allow the leader of the country\u2019s junta to run for the presidency.",
      "The referendum, which is a key step in the country\u2019s transition from military to civilian rule, is being closely monitored in the coup-battered region, with critics calling it a power grab. Some say it is a way for Gen. Mamadi Doumbouya, who took power by force four years ago, to seek the presidency and legitimize his military rule.",
      "Guinea is one of a growing number of West African countries, including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where the military has taken over.",
      "There are 6.7 million eligible voters and the referendum needs a turnout of at least 50% to pass. Some polling stations extended voting time after they were scheduled to close.",
      "The referendum was organized by the Directorate General of Elections, a new body that will oversee the vote count and whose two heads were elected by Doumbouya.",
      "Elections are expected to follow in December.",
      "Dozens of residents wearing their best clothes were lining up in central Conakry before dawn, waiting for a polling station to open.",
      "Mabinty Kalabane, a 23-year-old baker, voted on Sunday for the first time. She came to the polling station in central Conakry in a golden brown dress, a gift from her mother. \u201cI feel proud. I feel 100% Guinean, thanks to this card,\u201d she said, referring to the voting card she held in her hand. She was going to vote \u201cyes\u201d after reading parts of the draft constitution and finding it was \u201cin our advantage.\u201d",
      "In contrast to the festive atmosphere inside the polling stations, tanks and military barricades in the streets were a stark reminder of the junta\u2019s rule.",
      "Doumbouya, wearing a white polo shirt and a cap with Guinea logo on it, arrived Sunday morning at a voting station in downtown Conakry with his wife, a French national, and his son. Dozens of heavily armed special military forces were protecting him from journalists and citizens.",
      "In last days of the campaign, Conakry buzzed with Quran readings, reggae concerts and prayers held in support of Doumbouya. Supporters wearing T-shirts and boubous \u2014 traditional West African flowing garments \u2014 printed with Doumbouya\u2019s face, gathered at neighborhood rallies. Only one thing was missing: the opposition.",
      "Campaigning was banned on Friday and Saturday, but the referendum remained omnipresent. Public and private buildings in Conakry remained plastered with \u201cYes\" campaign billboards calling for approval of the referendum. At a concert held Friday night in one of Conakry's bars, band members sang a song about Doumbouya, repeatedly chanting \u201cOui! Oui! Oui!,\" or \u201cYes! Yes! Yes!\u201d in French, the country's official language.",
      "The opposition called on their supporters to boycott the referendum. The military regime had silenced critics and last year dissolved more than 50 political parties in a move it claimed was to \u201cclean up the political chessboard.\u201d Weeks before the referendum, it suspended the three main opposition parties, making it impossible for them to organize rallies and speak to the population.",
      "More than half of Guinea's population cannot read or write, which means they only get information about the new constitution from the \u201cyes\u201d camp, said Rafiou Sow, president of the opposition Renewal and Progress Party, one of the suspended political entities, who called for the boycott of the referendum.",
      "\u201cOur activists and supporters have no knowledge of this constitution. The moment we were excluded, they were excluded,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, who were supposed to help Guineans understand what is written in it, we are forbidden even to speak.\u201d",
      "Ibrahima Sory Diallo, a 42-year-old clothes seller from Conakry's suburb of Kaporo-Rails, said he followed the opposition's call for a boycott.",

      "\u201cThis is the first project of its type in Iraq that has this capacity,\u201d said Safaa Hussein, executive director of the new solar plant in Karbala, standing in front of row after row of black panels. From above, the project looks like a black-clad city surrounded by sand.",
      "The plant aims to \u201csupply the national network with electricity, and reduce the fuel consumption especially during the daytime peak load, in addition to reducing the negative environmental impact of gas emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "The newly opened solar plant in Karbala will eventually be able to produce up to 300 megawatts of electricity at its peak, said Nasser Karim al-Sudani, head of the national team for solar energy projects in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.

      "Deputy Minister of Electricity Adel Karim said Iraq has solar projects with a combined capacity of 12,500 megawatts either being implemented, in the approval process, or under negotiation. If fully realized, these projects would supply between 15% and 20% of Iraq\u2019s total electricity demand, excluding the semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region, he said.",

      "\u201cI feel at peace,\u201d said Amani, who lives on the outskirts of the North Kivu provincial capital of Goma. \u201cI don\u2019t see this leg as plastic, but as a second chance.\u201d",
      "Amani's wife and four children were killed when they came under attack by armed groups in April. Badly wounded and seeking help to start over, he found his way to Shirika la Umoja, an orthopedic center on the front line of eastern Congo's conflict in Goma, which finds itself overwhelmed by surging numbers of casualties.",
      "Congo's mineral-rich east has long been battered by fighting involving more than 100 armed groups including the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels. The rebels made an unprecedented advance in January and seized two key cities including Goma, further deepening one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "Some 7 million people had been displaced in the conflict that was already one of the world's largest humanitarian crises before it escalated this year. While fighting has largely reduced as a result of peace efforts, there are still pockets of clashes and civilians are still being killed.",
      "Shirika la Umoja has long been producing prosthetics for the wounded in Goma, with support from the International Committee of the Red Cross since 2005. But the escalation in fighting has brought increased demand for artificial limbs for amputees.",
      "\u201cEvery week, we receive new patients who lost limbs to stray bullets, landmines, or explosion,\u201d said Gis\u00e8le Kantu, a physical therapist at the center.",

      "The number of prosthetic limbs provided by the clinic has soared from 422 in all of 2024 to 326 in just the first half of 2025. There's no sign of demand easing anytime soon.",
      "The center currently runs with nearly three dozen professionals. Unlike in most other places, the prosthetics are made by hand, each one individually carved, molded and assembled.",

      "The melee outside the country\u2019s seat of power unfolded while more than 33,000 other protesters rallied in a historic park and a democracy monument in Manila. They expressed outrage over a corruption scandal involving lawmakers, officials and construction company owners who allegedly pocketed huge kickbacks from flood-control projects in the impoverished Southeast Asian country that is regularly buffeted by storms and typhoons.",
      "The hourslong rampage by about 100 mostly club-wielding people, some of whom waved Philippine flags and displayed carton posters with anti-corruption slogans, wounded about 70 Manila law enforcers, according to the Manila police. Schools were canceled due to the violence.",
      "Police said they lobbed tear gas to try to disperse the attackers, who sprayed graffiti on walls, toppled steel posts, shattered glass panels and ransacked the lobby of a budget inn along a popular road dotted with university campuses, banks and restaurants before dispersing at night.",
      "Hours after the assault, police have yet to identify the attackers, some of whom carried black flags with the caricature of a skull and crossbones.

His appointment has been controversial because he has kept his position as the head of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers while taking unpaid leave, raising concerns about the Fed's traditional independence from day-to-day politics.",

But he could remain on the board until a successor is appointed. There hasn't been a member of the executive branch on the Fed's board since the 1930s.",

The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue.",

      "In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month.",

      "If the Fed keeps cutting interest rates, that could give the struggling housing market a boost. But the growing expectations mean the market could be in for a disappointment and drop sharply if the Fed does not cut as much as traders expect.",

      "Critics say H-1B spots often go to entry-level jobs, rather than senior positions with unique skill requirements. And while the program isn\u2019t supposed to undercut U.S. wages or displace U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay less by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even if the specific workers hired have more experience.",
      "As a result, many U.S. companies find it cheaper to contract out help desks, programming and other basic tasks to consulting companies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tata in India and IBM and Cognizant in the U.S. These consulting companies hire foreign workers, often from India, and contract them out to U.S. employers looking to save money.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a bill extending the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday extended a signature state program aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions through 2045, a move Democrats cheered but Republicans warned would raise gas prices.",
      "The program known as cap and trade sets a declining limit on total greenhouse gas emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their pollution. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.",
      "It was set to expire after 2030. The law Newsom signed Friday at the Morrison Planetarium in San Francisco potentially boosts carbon-removal projects and requires the program to align with California's target of achieving so-called carbon neutrality by 2045. That means the state will remove as many carbon emissions as it releases. The law changes the name to \u201ccap and invest\u201d to emphasize that the money goes toward other programs.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doubling down on our best tool to combat Trump\u2019s assaults on clean air \u2014 Cap-and-Invest \u2014 by making polluters pay for projects that support our most impacted communities,\u201d Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement.",
      "Newsom also signed a law committing $1 billion in program revenue for the state\u2019s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.",
      "He approved other measures aimed at advancing the state\u2019s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians. They include laws to speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze and allow the state\u2019s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states.",
      "Newsom also signed a bill that would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.",
      "California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state\u2019s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.",

The program's \u201ccap\u201d applies to planet-warming emissions, not other pollutants impacting air quality. Cap and trade doesn't set emissions limits for individual facilities, meaning an industrial polluter could continue to emit the same amount of greenhouse gases over time so long as it has the right amount of credits or offsets.",
      "Other critics of the cap-and-trade extension are worried about it raising costs. The program has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played \u201ca very small role\u201d in increasing electricity prices because the state\u2019s grid isn\u2019t very carbon intensive, the report says.",

Tony Strickland said in a statement. \u201cTheir idea of tackling affordability is extending the Cap-and-Trade program, a hidden tax that drives up costs on everything from gas to groceries. That\u2019s not climate leadership. I call it economic sabotage.\u201d",
      "But Democratic Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, who wrote the reauthorization bill, said it will help the state fight climate change because \u201cthe cost of inaction is immeasurable.\u201d She referenced the devastating wildfire that ripped through Pacific Palisades in her district in January.",
      "Daniel Barad, the western states acting co-director for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said last week that the extension comes at a key time.",
      "\"The most important thing is it extends it to 2045, which was the most critical thing that the state could have done, especially in the face of federal rollbacks and attacks on California's authority to enforce our lifesaving regulations,\u201d he said.",

      "But there are ways to interrupt that downward spiral.",
      "Many people have found cognitive behavioral therapy, a form of talk therapy, helpful to examine internal monologues such as \u201cI\u2019m going to say the wrong thing\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not good enough\u201d \u2014 and replace them with neutral or positive mantras.",
      "\u201cWhat we do in cognitive behavior therapy is help people identify these negative thoughts, and then we teach them to evaluate those thoughts and see how accurate they are,\u201d said Judith Beck, president of the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy, based in Pennsylvania.",

      "If you find yourself having negative thoughts frequently, you\u2019re not alone. There are evolutionary reasons for it.",
      "\u201cWhen we were cavemen, it was very important for us to be alert for danger,\u201d Beck said. Preparing for the worst possible outcome helped people stay alive. Some worries \u2014 such as \u201cI don\u2019t have enough time to complete this project\u201d \u2014 can motivate people to get things done, she said.",

      "Now, instead of jumping to the worst conclusion, she pauses to examine the thought. \u201cWhat did they actually say to you?\u201d she asks herself. \u201cDid they say the actual words, \u2018You\u2019re terrible?\u2019 Did they actually say, \u2018You have to throw out the whole lesson?\u2019\u201d",

      "It can take time and practice to successfully reframe negative thoughts that have been replaying in our mind for years. When Renee Baker was studying architecture in college, professors and instructors frequently tore into her work. The critiques were designed to thicken her skin. But they had a lasting impact.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the self-doubt that comes with being told, literally, \u2018You\u2019re not good enough. Your ideas aren\u2019t good enough. Your work isn\u2019t good enough,\u2019\u201d said Baker, who\u2019s now director of project management at Inform Studio, a design firm. \u201cAt the heart of a lot of my self-doubt is feeling like my voice, and what I think, what I believe, what I am passionate about, isn\u2019t as important as the next person's.\u201d",
      "So Baker worked with a therapist to challenge her damaging core beliefs, exchanging them for more neutral thoughts. At work, she practiced speaking up even when her throat felt tight with anxiety. Over time, she became less anxious and more comfortable sharing her ideas.",
      "You can get specific when you're searching for alternative, healthier mantras.",
      "\u201cWhen we look at this sentence, \u2018They don\u2019t value the work that I\u2019m doing,\u2019 do you have any examples of when you felt your work was valued? Do you have examples of when people appreciated your work?\u201d Lev asked.",

When staff members complain that a young person is being manipulative, she helps them reframe the thought. \u201cHow about we just say that this young person is just using survival skills?\u201d she said.",
      "Brink, the assistant principal, learned to reframe her own negative thoughts, saying to herself: \u201cI made a lot of great choices today,\u201d or \u201cThis was what went well,\u201d and \u201cTomorrow we can try again with x, y and z.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Hoping that mortgage rates will keep dropping following the Federal Reserve's first rate cut since last year? Don't bank on it.",
      "As expected, the central bank delivered a quarter-point cut Wednesday and projected it would lower its benchmark rate twice more this year, reflecting growing concern over the U.S. job market.",
      "Here's a look at factors that determine mortgage rates and what the Fed's latest move means for the housing market:",
      "Mortgage rates have been mostly falling since late July on expectations of a Fed rate cut. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage was at 6.35% last week, its lowest level in nearly a year, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.",
      "A similar pullback in mortgage rates happened around this time last year in the weeks leading up to the Fed\u2019s first rate cut in more than four years. Back then, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage got down to a 2-year low of 6.08% one week after the central bank cut rates.",
      "But it hasn't come close to that since.",
      "Mortgage rates didn't keep falling last year, even as the Fed cut its main rate two more times. Instead, mortgage rates rose and kept climbing until the average rate on a 30-year home loan reached just over 7% by mid-January.",
      "Like last year, the Fed's rate cut doesn't necessarily mean mortgage rates will keep declining, even as the central bank signals more cuts ahead.",
      "\u201cRates could come down further, as the Fed has signaled the potential for two more rate cuts this year,\u201d said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. \u201cHowever, there are still risks of a reversal in mortgage rates. Inflation heated up in August and if the September inflation report shows another bump in consumer prices, it\u2019s possible we could see rates rise.\u201d",
      "No. Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Fed's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "Mortgage rates generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "That's because mortgages are typically bundled into mortgage-backed securities that are sold to investors. To keep mortgage-backed securities attractive to investors, their yield \u2014 or annual return -- is adjusted to be competitive with the yield offered by the U.S. on its 10-year government bonds. When those bond yields rise, they tend to push up mortgage rates, and vice-versa.",
      "The 10-year Treasury yield has been mostly easing since mid-July as growing signs that the job market has been weakening fueled expectations of a Fed rate cut this month.",
      "Until now, the Fed had kept its main interest rate on hold this year because it was more worried about inflation potentially worsening due to the Trump administration's tariffs than about the job market.",
      "At the same time, inflation has so far refused to go back below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "When the Fed cuts rates that can give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it can also fuel inflation. That, in turn, could push up mortgage rates.",

      "\u201cIf the Fed keeps lowering rates, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean mortgages will go down,\u201d said Stephen Kates, financial analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIt means that they probably could go down more, and they may trend in that direction, even if they don\u2019t move in lockstep.\u201d",
      "Ahead of the Fed's rate cut, the futures market had priced in expectations that the central bank would cut its key interest rate at upcoming policy meetings this year and into 2026. But the Fed's latest projections show a less aggressive path of rate cuts than the market has been expecting.",
      "\u201cThis ongoing gap between market and Fed expectations means that some risk of upward pressure on mortgage rates remains,\u201d said Hale, adding that the decline in mortgage rates \u201cis likely to continue at least through this week.\"",

      "The late-summer pullback in mortgage rates has been a welcome trend for the housing market, which has been in a slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years and have remained sluggish so far this year.",
      "While lower rates give home shoppers more purchasing power, mortgage rates remain too high for many Americans to afford to buy a home. That\u2019s mostly because home prices, while rising more slowly than in years past, are still up by roughly 50% nationally since the start of this decade.",
      "\u201cWhile lower rates will bring some buyers and sellers into the market, today\u2019s cut will not be enough to break up the housing market logjam,\u201d said Sturtevant. \"We will need to see further drops in mortgage rates and much slower home price growth, or even home price declines, to make a dent in affordability.\u201d",
      "If mortgage rates continue to ease, home shoppers will benefit from more affordable financing. But lower mortgage rates could also bring in more buyers, making the market more competitive at a time when sellers across the country are having a tougher time driving a hard bargain.",
      "Predicting when mortgage rates will decline and by how much is daunting because so many variables can influence their trajectory from one week to the next.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current rates may be better off buying now if they find a property that fits their needs, rather than attempt to time the market, said Kates.",
      "Many homeowners looking to refinance have already seized on the decline in rates, sending applications for refinance loans sharply higher in recent weeks.",
      "One rule of thumb to consider when refinancing is whether you can reduce your current rate by at least one percentage point, which helps blunt the impact of refinancing fees.",

      "NEW YORK -- Gen Z has seen its credit scores drop more than any other generation over the past year, largely because of student loan debt, according to a new report out this week.",
      "The total national average credit score dropped two points this year to 715, according to the report from credit scoring company FICO. But Gen Z's average score dropped three points to 676, the largest year-over-year decrease among any age group since 2020.",
      "A credit score is a mathematical formula that helps lenders determine how likely you are to pay back a loan. Credit scores are based on your credit history and range from 300 to 850.",
      "The report found that 34% of Gen Z consumers have open student loans, compared to 17% of the total population, and the decline in credit scores is primarily due to the resumption of student loan delinquency reporting.",
      "The U.S. Department of Education paused federal student loan payments in March 2020, offering borrowers relief during the economic chaos of the coronavirus pandemic. Though payments were set to resume in 2023, the Biden administration provided a one-year grace period that ended in October 2024.",

      "Between student loans, a tough job market, and high inflation, young consumers are struggling to make payments on time, according to the report.

      "Protesters are hitting France with transport strikes, demonstrations and blockades, targeting the Paris Metro and other sectors",
      "PARIS -- Protesters hit France with transport strikes, notably hobbling the Paris Metro, demonstrations and traffic slowdowns and blockades Thursday, pitting the power of the streets against President Emmanuel Macron 's government and its proposals to cut funding for public services that underpin the French way of life.",
      "The first whiffs of police teargas came before daybreak, with scuffles between riot officers and protesters in Paris. Nationwide demonstrations, from France's biggest cities to small towns, were expected to mobilize hundreds of thousands of marchers, voicing anger about mounting poverty, sharpening inequality and struggles for low-paid workers and others to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cWe say \u2018no\u2019 to the government. We\u2019ve had enough. There\u2019s no more money, a high cost of living,\" striking transport worker Nadia Belhoum said at a before-dawn protest targeting a Paris bus depot. She described \u201cpeople agonizing, being squeezed like a lemon even if there\u2019s no more juice.\u201d",
      "Labor unions that called strikes are pushing for the abandonment of proposed budget cuts, social welfare freezes and other belt-tightening that opponents contend will further hit the pockets of low-paid and middle-class workers and which triggered the collapse of successive governments that sought to push through savings.",
      "Opponents of Macron's business-friendly leadership complain that taxpayer-funded public services \u2014 free schools and public hospitals, subsidized health care, unemployment benefits and other safety nets that are cherished in France \u2014 are being eroded. Left-wing parties and their supporters want the wealthy and businesses to pay more, rather than see spending cuts to plug holes in France's finances and to rein in its debts.",
      "\u201cPublic service is falling apart,\u201d said teacher Claudia Nunez. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same people who pay.\u201d",
      "The day of upheaval \u2014 with strikes also impacting schools, industry and other sectors of the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy \u2014 aimed to turn up the heat on new Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu. Macron appointed him last week, tasking Lecornu with building parliamentary support for belt-tightening that brought down his predecessors.",
      "\u201cBringing in Lecornu doesn\u2019t change anything \u2014 he\u2019s just another man in a suit who will follow Macron\u2019s line,\u201d said 22-year-old student Juliette Martin.",
      "\u201cWe want our voices heard. People my age feel like no one in politics is speaking for us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always our generation that ends up with the insecurity and the debt.\u201d",
      "Unions have decried budget proposals by Macron's minority governments, weakened by their lack of a dependable majority in parliament, as brutal and punitive for workers, retirees and others who are vulnerable.",
      "\u201cThe bourgeoisie of this country have been gorging themselves, they don\u2019t even know what to do with their money anymore. So if there is indeed a crisis, the question is who should pay for it,\u201d said Fabien Villedieu, a leader of the SUD-Rail train workers union. \u201cWe are asking that the government\u2019s austerity plan that consists of making the poorest in this country always pay \u2014 whether they are employees, retirees, students \u2014 ends and that we make the richest in this country pay.\u201d",
      "Striking rail workers waving flares made a brief foray into the Paris headquarters of the Economics Ministry, leaving trails of smoke in the air before leaving.",
      "Macron's opponents also continue to denounce unpopular pension reforms that he railroaded through parliament and which raised the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64, triggering a firestorm of anger and rounds of protest earlier in what is his second and last term as president, which ends in 2027.",

      "The swap attracted about 150 people, and grew from there. Now, the twice-yearly event, which organizers call The Biggest Swap in the Northwest, draws between 500 and 850 participants to share clothes and accessories in a partylike atmosphere.",
      "\u201cWe have a DJ and two full bars, so there\u2019s some singing and dancing. But no one\u2019s getting drunk at 1 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon,\u201d said Ridgway\u2019s co-founder, Elizabeth Mollo.",
      "The swap is part of a larger movement across the country to share resources with neighbors \u2014 one shirt, meal or book at time.",
      "The Portland event asks for a $10 entry fee to cover costs, but the clothes are free and there\u2019s no limit to how much participants can take. People bring their gently used clothing, shoes and accessories to a sorting station, where volunteers sort it into bins and onto tables.",
      "Ridgway, who worked in the apparel industry, sees the process as an answer to throwaway \u201cfast fashion.\u201d She describes \u201cthe \u2018peak pile\u2019 moment, when our sorters are summiting a mountain, a literal tonnage of apparel, sorting as quickly as they can. In this moment, we see the true ramifications of consumer culture and waste.\u201d",
      "Leftover clothing is donated to another free neighborhood swapping event.",
      "Ridgway recalls a single mom telling her she was able to outfit her teenager with Nike shoes and other major brands typically outside her price range. \u201cThese conversations, and so many others, have truly kept me coming back to this event,\u201d she says.",
      "There are no dressing rooms, so participants are encouraged to come in tight-fitting clothes and try things on where they are.",

      "Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs beat the New York Giants 22-9 to pick up their first win of the season",
      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Mistakes and penalties threatened to derail the Kansas City Chiefs again early in a season that had not been going their way. Patrick Mahomes made a couple himself.",
      "\u201cI kept throwing the ball backwards,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cThat's not good.\u201d",
      "Mahomes recovered his backward pass, had plenty of good throws going forward and helped the Chiefs pick up their first win of the season by beating the New York Giants 22-9 on Sunday night. Coach Andy Reid called it \u201ca good win to get, in particular when you haven\u2019t have one.\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously we didn\u2019t have the start we wanted, but it\u2019s a long season,\u201d said linebacker Nick Bolton, who had a game-high 14 tackles. \u201cWe\u2019ve been searching for one win and try to figure out how we can get this thing going. The main thing now is just keep working, keep stacking and try to get another, then get another win.\u201d",
      "Mahomes completed 22 of 37 passes for 224 yards and a touchdown pass to Tyquan Thornton to go along with a momentum-altering recovery by snatching the ball out of defender Bobby Okereke's hands. His on-the-run 33-yard throw to Thornton midway through the fourth quarter set up Kareem Hunt's 1-yard TD run that put the game away and sent many fans to the exits.",
      "The Chiefs (1-2) avoided what would have been their first 0-3 start since 2011, two years before Reid took over and started an era that has included a trio of Super Bowl titles and two additional appearances \u2014 including trips the past three seasons.",
      "The Giants fell to 0-3, with Russell Wilson throwing two interceptions and finishing 18 of 32 for 160 yards. Chants of \u201cWe want Dart!\u201d followed Wilson's second pick, and while Jaxson Dart got in for a handful of snaps, all were handoffs. The first-round pick and prospective quarterback of the future has yet to attempt a pass in his rookie season.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t convert on third down, it\u2019s hard to sustain anything,\u201d coach Brian Daboll said of his team, which converted just once on 10 tries. \"On offense, nothing was good enough. I would be booing too.\u201d",
      "Mahomes, who turned 30 this week, ran far less than the first two games, when he was Kansas City's leading rusher each time. Isiah Pacheco had that distinction at New York, recording 45 yards on 10 carries.",
      "Giants rookie Cam Skattebo ran for a touchdown for a second consecutive game and finished with 121 yards from scrimmage. Skattebo shouldered the load in the backfield, sharing time with Devin Singletary after Tyrone Tracy injured his right shoulder late in the first quarter.",
      "Thrown at seven times, Malik Nabers had just two catches for 13 yards. The Chiefs locked down Nabers a week after holding Philadelphia\u2019s A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith to nine receptions for 80 yards.",

      "Kara Lawson helped the U.S. women's basketball team win an Olympic gold medal as a player 17 years ago. Now she'll have a chance to lead it to another as the coach in the 2028 Los Angeles Games.",
      "Lawson was announced as the head coach for the women's team for the next four years by USA Basketball on Monday.",
      "\u201cI mean it's hard to put everything into words as it's something I\u2019ve been working towards. I have so much love for USA Basketball and have been so excited to serve in any capacity they ask me to,\u201d Lawson said in a phone interview. \u201cIt's the best job in the sport in our country. To lead the U.S. women\u2019s national team is such an amazing feeling. I felt a great sense of excitement and pride and just am really grateful for the opportunity.\u201d",
      "Naming Lawson coach was the first official move made by Sue Bird, who started as the U.S. national team director earlier this year. In the past, a committee would decide on the coach and roster.",
      "\u201cI think her resume, her experience, it all kind of speaks for itself,\u201d Bird said in a phone interview. \u201cWhen you start to learn about Kara and what she\u2019s been a part of from a USA Basketball standpoint, that experience specifically made it really clear she's the right person to lead us into the next cycle.\u201d",
      "Lawson's first chance to coach the team in a major competition will be at the World Cup next September in Germany. The Americans will play next March in a qualifier for that tournament, but that's right before the NCAA Tournament, which would make it difficult for Lawson to coach the U.S. because she also leads Duke's women's basketball team.",
      "\u201cAssembling a great staff for the national team is of the utmost importance,\" said the 44-year-old Lawson. \"I\u2019ll lean on that staff a lot through that cycle. ... You have to have great coaches around you, have great players around you. We have the ability to do both and that will be our challenge. Find the right group that will fit.\u201d",
      "In addition to the Olympic gold she won as a player at the Beijing Games, Lawson helped the U.S. win gold as an assistant coach at the 2022 World Cup and 2024 Paris Olympics and as head coach at the FIBA Women\u2019s AmeriCup in July.",
      "\u201cI know this from playing with her and know this from all the conversations I had with her: I'm hard-pressed to find someone who is as prepared as Kara is,\u201d Bird said.",
      "Lawson also coached the USA Basketball 3-on-3 team to gold at the Tokyo Games, the first time that sport had been contested at an Olympics.",
      "\u201cKara has been involved with USA Basketball dating back to 1998 as a high school player in the World Youth Games,\u201d USA Basketball CEO Jim Tooley said. \u201cHer international basketball experience is extensive, including 13 gold medals. To say her journey with us has been impressive is an understatement. I\u2019m excited to watch Kara and Sue work together to deliver success at the World Cup in Berlin next fall and at the Olympic Games in LA in 2028.\u201d",

There was no replay review by the ACC officiating crew, even though Dykes called timeout before the Frogs missed a 47-yard field goal.",

      "Minnesota Vikings cornerback Isaiah Rodgers became the first player in team history with two defensive touchdowns in the same game",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- There was no cooling off Isaiah Rodgers no matter how many towels his fawning teammates used to fan the white-hot Vikings cornerback on the sideline.",
      "Rodgers\u2019 historic domination of the Cincinnati Bengals was so disruptive the Vikings\u2019 offense had to shush the home crowd at U.S. Bank Stadium for serenading the one-man turnover machine too loudly on the videoboard while Carson Wentz was trying to run a play.",
      "That\u2019ll happen when you score a pair of defensive touchdowns and force another fumble \u2014 all in the first half \u2014 to help Minnesota rout the Bengals and backup quarterback Jake Browning 48-10 on Sunday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that, literally in just one half,\u201d marveled Vikings safety Harrison Smith, who has seen plenty over his 14 years in the NFL.",
      "Rodgers\u2019 explosive plays, Browning\u2019s ineffectiveness and Cincinnati\u2019s five turnovers allowed the Vikings defense to steamroll the Bengals, who were without star quarterback Joe Burrow as he recovers from toe surgery.",
      "With Minnesota leading 7-0 early in the first quarter, Rodgers intercepted an off-balance Browning after Smith tipped a pass intended for Chase Brown. The sixth-year cornerback deftly snagged the ball, slipped through a tackle at his 20-yard-line and sprinted up the left sideline to give the Vikings a two-touchdown lead.",
      "\u201cThe crowd kept getting louder and louder as I was getting close,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI just wanted to get into the end zone.\u201d",
      "Later in the second quarter, Rodgers stripped tight end Noah Fant after a 4-yard catch, scooped the ball and raced 66 yards untouched into the end zone.",
      "Topping it off, Rodgers snuffed the Bengals\u2019 next possession by forcing Ja\u2019Marr Chase to fumble after a 15-yard reception, which Jeff Okudah recovered near midfield to set up Jordan Mason's touchdown run.",
      "Rodgers, who signed with Minnesota as a free agent after winning a Super Bowl last year with Philadelphia, became the first player in Vikings history with two defensive touchdowns in a game.",
      "He is the 11th player since the Super Bowl era began in 1966 with interception and fumble return touchdowns in the same game, according to Sportradar. Samson Ebukam was the most recent on Nov. 19, 2018, for the Los Angeles Rams in a 54-51 victory over Kansas City.",

Not surprised, though. That\u2019s a player from the very moment we signed him, I knew he was going to have a monumental impact our team.\u201d",
      "Rodgers spent two seasons with the Eagles after Indianapolis drafted him in the sixth round in 2020. The Colts released Rodgers and he was suspended for the 2023 season for violating the NFL\u2019s gambling rules after the league investigated and found that Rodgers had opened a sportsbook account under a friend\u2019s name and made about 100 bets, including wagers on his team.",
      "The year in exile humbled Rodgers. He won a ring as a role player for the Eagles before signing with Minnesota. And now he stands alone among the greatest defensive performances in the 125-year history of the NFL.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI was shocked when I saw it on the big screen. Just trying to make plays and have fun. We just had a day today.\u201d",

      "Determining next steps for the algorithm, currently owned by the Beijing-based ByteDance, has been one of the most closely watched issues during negotiations over TikTok's future.",
      "The Trump administration official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the emerging deal, said they believe the plan will satisfy national security concerns if TikTok divests from its Chinese parent, ByteDance. President Joe Biden signed bipartisan legislation before leaving office requiring the Chinese company to sell its assets to an American company or face a ban.",
      "American officials have previously warned the algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect.",

      "The Ukrainian army is especially eager to deploy what soldiers refer to as \u201crobots on wheels\u201d as it faces a shortage of soldiers in a war that has dragged on for more than 3 \u00bd years. The vehicles look like miniature tanks and can ferry supplies, clear mines and evacuate the wounded or dead.",

      "Ahead of Sunday's vote to choose a new 101-seat legislature, multiple online monitoring groups have tracked propaganda and disinformation campaigns attributed to Russia. Their aim is to diminish support for the ruling pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity, or PAS, in a vote many view as a geopolitical choice between East and West.",

      "In a microcosm of life today, social media is where Americans have gone to process last week's killing in Utah and is the chief tool his supporters are using to police those they feel aren't offering proper respect. Investigators are probing the time the man accused of killing Kirk, Tyler Robinson, spent in the \u201cdark corners of the internet\u201d \u2014 anti-social media, if you will \u2014 leading up to when he allegedly pulled the trigger.",

      "Chilling videos of Kirk's Sept. 10 assassination immediately overwhelmed sites like X, TikTok and YouTube, and companies are still working to contain their spread. Confrontational material and conspiracy theories are pushed into social media feeds because they do precisely what they're designed to do \u2014 keep people on the platforms for longer periods of time.",

Where we interact with other people, how we interact with broader society, that is more and more happening over feed algorithms. This is the most recent in a long line of ways that society has been changed by media technology.\u201d",
      "Divisive content and the proliferation of the video of Kirk's death may not have been the goal but are the direct result of decisions made to maximize profits and cut back on content moderation, Edelson said.",

Nepal's unrest illustrated the dangers of government involvement: Social media sites were shut down and users protested, suggesting it had been a way to stop criticism of the government. Police opened fire at one demonstration, killing 19 people.",
      "Persuading social media sites to change their algorithms is also an uphill battle. They live off attention and people spending as much time as possible on them. Unless advertisers flee for fear of being associated with violent posts, there's little incentive for them to change, said Jasmine Enberg, a social media analyst at Emarketer.",

      "The approval of a high seas treaty means new protections will be possible for international waters for the first time",
      "The approval of a high seas treaty means new protections will be possible in international waters for the first time.",
      "Here's a rundown of what the treaty is, why it matters and what is still to come.",
      "Formally known as the Agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction, the treaty is the first legally binding agreement aimed at protecting marine biodiversity in international waters. These areas, which lie beyond the jurisdiction of any single country, account for nearly two-thirds of the ocean and nearly half of Earth\u2019s surface.",
      "Until now, no comprehensive legal framework existed to create marine protected areas or enforce conservation on the high seas.",
      "Despite their remoteness, the high seas are under growing pressure from overfishing, climate change and the threat of deep-sea mining. Environmental advocates warn that without proper protections, marine ecosystems in international waters face irreversible harm.",
      "\u201cUntil now, it has been the wild west on the high seas,\u201d said Megan Randles, global political lead for oceans at Greenpeace. \u201cNow we have a chance to properly put protections in place.\u201d",
      "The treaty is also essential to achieving what's known as the global \u201c30x30\u201d target \u2014 an international pledge to protect 30% of the planet\u2019s land and sea by 2030.",
      "The treaty creates a legal process for countries to establish marine protected areas in the high seas, including rules for potentially destructive activities like deep-sea mining and geoengineering. It also establishes a framework for technology-sharing, funding mechanisms and scientific collaboration among countries.",
      "Crucially, decisions under the treaty will be made multilaterally through what\u2019s called a conference of the parties rather than by individual countries acting alone.",

      "Ratification Friday by a 60th nation triggered a 120-day countdown before the treaty enters into force. Countries can already begin planning high seas protected areas, but formal proposals will only move forward once oversight mechanisms and decision-making rules are established.",
      "The first conference of the parties must be held within a year of the treaty taking effect. It will lay the groundwork for implementation, including decisions on governance, financing and the creation of key bodies to evaluate marine protection proposals.",
      "Environmental groups are pushing for even more countries to ratify the treaty and to do so quickly \u2014 the more countries that ratify, the stronger and more representative the treaty\u2019s implementation will be. There\u2019s a carrot for countries to do so. Only those that ratify by that first conference will be eligible to vote on critical decisions that determine how the treaty will operate.",

      "A California judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by an Indigenous tribe from the Brazilian Amazon against The New York Times and TMZ",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A California judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by an Indigenous tribe in the Brazilian Amazon against The New York Times and TMZ that claimed the newspaper\u2019s reporting on the tribe\u2019s first exposure to the internet led to its members being widely portrayed as technology-addled and addicted to pornography.",
      "The suit was filed in May by the Marubo Tribe of the Javari Valley, a sovereign community of about 2,000 people in the Amazon rainforest.",
      "Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Tiana J. Murillo on Tuesday sided with the Times, whose lawyers argued in a hearing Monday that its coverage last year was fair and protected by free speech.",
      "TMZ argued that its coverage, which followed the Times\u2019 initial reporting, addressed ongoing public controversies and matters of public interest.",
      "The suit claimed stories by TMZ and Yahoo amplified and sensationalized the Times\u2019 reporting and smeared the tribe in the process. Yahoo was dismissed as a defendant earlier this month.",
      "Murillo wrote in her ruling that though some may \u201creasonably perceive\u201d the Times\u2019 and TMZ\u2019s reporting as \u201cinsensitive, disparaging or reflecting a lack of respect, the Court need not, and does not, determine which of these characterizations is most apt.\u201d",
      "The judge added that \u201cregardless of tone, TMZ\u2019s segment contributed to existing debate over the effects of internet connectivity on remote Indigenous communities.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are pleased by the comprehensive and careful analysis undertaken by the court in dismissing this frivolous lawsuit,\" Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokesperson for the Times, said in a statement Wednesday to The Associated Press. \"Our reporter traveled to the Amazon and provided a nuanced account of tension that arose when modern technology came to an isolated community.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for TMZ did not immediately respond to an email request for comment Wednesday.",
      "Plaintiffs in the lawsuit included the tribe, community leader Enoque Marubo and Brazilian journalist and sociologist Flora Dutra, who were both mentioned in the June 2024 story. Both were instrumental in bringing the tribe the internet connection, which they said has had many positive effects including facilitating emergency medicine and the education of children.",
      "N. Micheli Quadros, the attorney who represents the tribe, Marubo and Dutra, wrote to the AP Wednesday that the judge\u2019s decision \u201chighlights the imbalance of our legal system,\u201d which \u201coften shields powerful institutions while leaving vulnerable individuals, such as Indigenous communities without meaningful recourse.\u201d",

      "Quadros said the plaintiffs will decide their next steps in the coming days, whether that is through courts in California or international human rights bodies.",
      "\u201cThis case is bigger than one courtroom or one ruling,\u201d Quadros wrote. \u201cIt is about accountability, fairness, and the urgent need to protect communities that have historically been silenced or marginalized.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit sought at least $180 million, including both general and punitive damages, from each of the defendants.",
      "The suit argued that the Times\u2019 story by reporter Jack Nicas on how the group was handling the introduction of internet service via Starlink satellites operated by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX \u201cportrayed the Marubo people as a community unable to handle basic exposure to the internet, highlighting allegations that their youth had become consumed by pornography.\u201d",
      "The court disagreed with the tribe\u2019s claims that the Times article falsely implied its youth were \u201caddicted to pornography,\u201d noting that the coverage only mentioned unidentified young men had access to porn and did not state that the tribe as a whole was addicted to pornography.",
      "Nicas reported that in less than a year of Starlink access, the tribe was dealing with the same struggles the rest of the world has dealt with for years due to the pervasive effects of the internet. The challenges ranged from \u201cteenagers glued to phones; group chats full of gossip; addictive social networks; online strangers; violent video games; scams; misinformation; and minors watching pornography,\" Nicas wrote.",
      "He also wrote that a tribal leader said young men were sharing explicit videos in group chats. The piece doesn't mention porn elsewhere, but other outlets amplified that aspect of the story. TMZ posted a story with the headline, \u201cElon Musk\u2019s Starlink Hookup Leaves A Remote Tribe Addicted To Porn.\u201d",
      "The Times published a follow-up story in response to misperceptions brought on by other outlets in which Nicas wrote: \u201cThe Marubo people are not addicted to pornography. There was no hint of this in the forest, and there was no suggestion of it in The New York Times\u2019s article.\u201d",
      "Nicas wrote that he spent a week with the Marubo tribe. The lawsuit claimed that while he was invited for a week, he spent less than 48 hours in the village, \u201cbarely enough time to observe, understand, or respectfully engage with the community.\"",

      "BEIJING -- China's Huawei Technologies said Thursday that it would roll out the world's most powerful AI computing clusters over the next two years as it seeks to outperform global leaders despite relying on less powerful domestic semiconductors.",
      "China is racing to develop its own technology as America restricts what can be sold to China, including its most advanced chips. At the same time, the Chinese government has reportedly told companies to stop buying some American chips as it seeks to transform China into a global tech leader and one that is less reliant on imported components.",

      "Days after Meagan Brazil-Sheehan\u2019s 6-year-old son was diagnosed with leukemia, they were walking down the halls of UMass Memorial Children\u2019s Medical Center when they ran into Robin the Robot.",
      "\u201cLuca, how are you?\u201d it asked in a high-pitched voice programmed to sound like a 7-year-old girl. \"It\u2019s been awhile.\u201d",

      "As AI increasingly becomes a part of daily life, it's found a foothold in medical care \u2014 providing everything from note-taking during exams to electronic nurses. While heralded by some for the efficiency it brings, others worry about its impact on patient care.",
      "Robin is about 30% autonomous, while a team of operators working remotely controls the rest under the watchful eyes of clinical staff. Khachikyan said that with each interaction, they\u2019re able to collect more data \u2014 while still complying with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA \u2014 and get closer to it being able to function independently.",
      "\u201cImagine a pure emotional intelligence like WALL-E. We\u2019re trying to create that,\u201d he said, referencing the 2008 animated film.",
      "On a recent Friday, a staff member at HealthBridge Children\u2019s Hospital in Orange County, California, read off a list of patients she needed Robin to visit, along with the amount of time to spend with each one.",
      "The robot with a sleek white triangle-shaped frame that Khachikyan said was designed for hugging, rolled into a room with a teenager injured in a car accident. The robot played what it described as his favorite song \u2014 \u201cNo Fear\u201d by DeJ Loaf \u2014 and he danced along. In the hallway, Robin cracked up a young child held by her mother when it put on a series of silly glasses and a big red nose. In another room, the robot played a simplified version of tic-tac-toe with a patient.",
      "Samantha da Silva, speech language pathologist at the hospital, said patients light up when Robin comes into their room and not only remembers their names but their favorite music.",
      "\u201cShe brings joy to everyone,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cShe walks down the halls, everyone loves to chat with her, say hello.\u201d",
      "Robin mirrors the emotions of the person it is talking with, explained Khachikyan. If the patient is laughing then the robot laughs along, but if they're sharing something difficult, its face reflects sadness and empathy.",
      "In nursing homes, Robin plays memory games with people suffering from dementia, takes them through breathing exercises on difficult days and offers them a form of companionship that resembles a grandchild with a grandparent.",
      "Khachikyan recalled a moment last year at a facility in Los Angeles where a woman was having a panic attack and asked specifically for the robot. Robin played songs by her favorite musician and videos of her favorite animal \u2014 Elvis Presley and puppies \u2014 until she had calmed down.",

      "The Trump administration stated on Monday that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy may be linked to an increased risk of autism and that pregnant women should limit their use, contradicting medical evidence.",
      "In a press conference at the White House, President Donald Trump, flanked by the nation's top public health officials, said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will begin notifying physicians immediately that it is \"strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary.\"",
      "\"They are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary,\" Trump said. \"That's, for instance, in cases of extremely high fever.\"",
      "Studies on this question have not shown a direct cause and effect. Some studies point to a possible link, but major medical groups have evaluated the evidence and continue to recommend acetaminophen as the safest painkiller during pregnancy.",
      "Trump and his health officials said that the FDA would update the label for acetaminophen, commonly known as Tylenol, to \"reflect potential benefits in reducing some autism symptoms.\"",
      "But Trump went further, directly addressing pregnant women during the press conference, stating, \"Don't take Tylenol. There's no downside. Don't take it.\"",
      "\"You'll be uncomfortable,\" he added. \"It won't be as easy, maybe. But don't take it if you're pregnant. Don't take Tylenol, and don't give it to the baby after the baby is born.\"",
      "At one point, Trump acknowledged that his remarks were based less on scientific evidence and more on his own life experiences and \"common sense.\"",
      "\"You know, I'm just making these statements from me,\" he said. \"I'm not making them from these doctors, because when they talk about, you know, different results, different studies, I talk about a lot of common sense. And they have that too. They have that too, a lot.\"",
      "Major medical groups reacted strongly, expressing concern that pregnant women may be discouraged to use acetaminophen even if they could benefit.",
      "In a statement, Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), said the medical group continues to recommend acetaminophen as the safest painkiller during pregnancy.",
      "\"Suggestions that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism are not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients, including those who may need to rely on this beneficial medicine during pregnancy,\" Fleischman said.",

It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data,\" the statement continued.",
      "On Monday evening, the FDA released its note to doctors about a possible link between acetaminophen during pregnancy and autism, which was more measured than the president's assertions.",
      "The note included language that there has been no evidence that Tylenol causes autism, and the association is an ongoing area of scientific debate.",
      "\"To be clear, while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature,\" the note read. \"The association is an ongoing area of scientific debate and clinicians should be aware of the issue in their clinical decision-making.\"",

Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.\"",
      "Studies have been mixed on whether acetaminophen is linked to a higher risk of ADHD or autism, but no published study has found that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes autism. There are also multiple studies that show there is no link between vaccines and autism.",
      "An April 2024 study, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and published in JAMA, found that using acetaminophen during pregnancy was not linked to an increased risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability in children.",
      "During the press conference, federal officials cited an August 2025 meta-analysis from researchers at Mt. Sinai, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Heath, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and UMass Lowell that found prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and ADHD, in children.",
      "However, the authors of the meta-analysis said their work does not prove Tylenol taken during pregnancy causes autism, and did not recommend that pregnant patients stop using Tylenol.",

      "Helen Tager-Flusberg, director of the Center for Autism Research Excellence at Boston University and a member of the coalition of vaccine scientists, told ABC News that researchers have been studying autism's many causes for decades and that the best work combines genetic, medical and environmental data.",
      "She warned that revealing findings without methods or peer review risks alarming the public and undermining ongoing NIH research efforts.",
      "\"None of the gold standard parameters include announcing the findings of a study at a press conference, none include conducting this study without disclosing methods or research questions, but instead turning this into a big surprise,\" she said.",
      "The administration also announced on Monday that it is starting an approval process for a drug called leucovorin, despite limited evidence of benefit.",
      "Leucovorin, which is typically used as part of cancer care, has shown early promise in a handful of small studies suggesting it may help the symptoms of some children with autism.",
      "Typically, more robust studies would be required for a new FDA approval. Doctors say there could be some promise for this drug, but caution that more research is needed to understand how much -- or even whether -- this drug helps certain children.",
      "In the press release, GSK, the maker of the drug, did not mention autism by name but said it is starting a process to expand the approval.",
      "During the press conference on Monday, Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also suggested the childhood vaccine schedule could contribute to autism, contradicting years of research that has found no link between the two.",

      "FORT PIERCE, Fla. -- Ryan Routh texted his three adult children and his fiancee separately to tell them he loved them, according to cellphone records, shortly before authorities say he was spotted by a U.S. Secret Service agent, who identified Routh as the man who tried to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course.",
      "Later that same day, Routh called his fiancee from the Palm Beach County jail to tell her about his arrest, but she already knew. \u201cEverybody knows, it\u2019s been hours,\u201d the woman can be heard saying on a recording of the call. \u201cThe whole world knows.\u201d",
      "Routh is representing himself in federal court after being charged with trying kill Trump and is set to present his defense Monday, calling just three witnesses.",
      "Seasoned prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida rested their case Friday afternoon after spending seven days questioning 38 witnesses in an attempt to make sure Routh spends the rest of his life in prison.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Trump before aiming a rifle through shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club.",
      "Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.",
      "He told U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon on Friday that he only needs half a day or so to present his defense. He has indicated that he plans to call a firearms expert and two character witnesses. He hasn\u2019t said whether he plans to testify himself.",
      "Cannon signed off on Routh\u2019s request to represent himself following two hearings in July. Routh told the judge that his court-appointed federal public defenders were diligent, but they didn\u2019t listen to him and were afraid of him.",
      "\u201cHow are they supposed to represent me and say I\u2019m not a dangerous person when they don\u2019t believe that?\u201d Routh said in July.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has held that criminal defendants have a right to represent themselves in court proceedings, as long as they can show a judge they are competent to waive their right to be defended by an attorney. Routh's former defense attorneys have served as standby counsel since Routh took over his own defense and have been present during trial the past two weeks.",
      "Cannon said attorneys should be prepared to deliver their closing arguments Tuesday, giving each side one hour and 45 minutes. Jurors will begin deliberating after that. Cannon had initially blocked off more than three weeks for the trial at the Fort Pierce federal courthouse, but Routh's relatively short cross-examinations have led to a quicker pace than anticipated.",

      "In 2010, police searched a warehouse Routh owned and found more than 100 stolen items, from power tools and building supplies to kayaks and spa tubs. In both felony cases, judges gave Routh either probation or a suspended sentence.",

Students and faculty returned to classes this week still reeling with grief, fear and anxiety, and confronting a thorny question: How do they deal with UVU's sudden infamy?",

      "The school has had only minimal violence for years, according to data collected by the U.S. Department of Education. UVU's most recent report for its main campus in Orem, covering 2021-2023, showed police investigated or received reports on four aggravated assault allegations, 13 rape allegations, one apparent arson and no cases of murder or manslaughter. Kirk's killing was the first murder on campus that administrators are aware of, University spokeswoman Ellen Treanor said.",

      "In the days since, Holt took time off from work and went home to spend a night with her family in Salt Lake City. She said she feels like the university failed Kirk and his family by not providing better security. She worries about going to classes in a building near the crime scene.",
      "Yet as Kirk's shooting deepens the nation's political divides, Holt believes the shared trauma has brought UVU closer together.",
      "\u201cWe're all people who, you know, loved him or hated him,\u201d she said of Kirk. \u201cWe're all still coming together no matter how we believed, and I feel like this has made our school closer than ever.\u201d",
      "When students returned Wednesday, they reported classes were quieter than usual. Matthew Caldwell, 24, said that in history class, \u201cit felt as if the professor was more understanding of all beliefs and that ultimately it\u2019s about sharing those beliefs.\u201d",

      "Trump said Chicago is \u201cprobably next\u201d after National Guard troops go to Memphis.",
      "Delphine Cherry knows as well as anyone how intractable violent crime is in Chicago. In 1992, her teenage daughter was gunned down in one of the city's toniest neighborhoods \u2014 a bystander caught up in a gang shootout. Twenty years later in a suburb just south of the city, it claimed her son.",
      "\u201cYou don't think it's going to happen twice in your life,\u201d she said.",
      "Chicago has been bracing for weeks for President Donald Trump's promised deployment of National Guard troops to the nation's third-largest city. Although Trump said the troops would help fight crime in a city he described as a \u201chellhole,\u201d his administration has been tightlipped about the operation's details, including when it would start, how long it would last, how many troops would be used and what role they would play in civilian law enforcement.",
      "Trump has also veered back and forth on sending troops to Chicago \u2014 at times insisting he would act unilaterally to deploy them and at other points suggesting he would rather send them to New Orleans or some other city in a state where their governor \u201cwants us to come in.\u201d Most recently, he said this week that Chicago is \u201cprobably next\u201d after National Guard troops are sent to Memphis.",
      "Although Chicago has had one of the highest rates of gun violence of any major American city for some time, city and state leaders overwhelmingly oppose the planned operation, calling it political theater. And even those most directly affected, including people who have lost loved ones to violent crime, wonder how sending in troops would have any lasting effect on the fight against it.",
      "With plans for the Chicago deployment unknown, the ways National Guard troops have been used in Los Angeles and Washington this summer might offer clues.",
      "In June, Trump deployed thousands of Guard troops to Los Angeles amid protests over his administration's immigration crackdown there. Although the troops initially were assigned to guard federal property, they also provided protection for immigration agents during raids and took part in a show of force at a park in a heavily immigrant neighborhood of LA that local officials believe was meant to sow fear.",
      "In August, Trump announced he was placing Washington\u2019s police force under his control and mobilizing federal forces to reduce crime and homelessness there. The troops who were deployed have patrolled around Metro stations and in the most tourist-heavy parts of the nation's capital. But they have also been spotted picking up trash and raking leaves in city parks.",
      "The White House reported that more than 2,100 arrests had been made in Washington in the first few weeks after Trump announced he was mobilizing federal forces. And Mayor Muriel Bowser credited the federal deployment with a drop in crime, including an 87% decline in carjackings, but also criticized the frequent immigration arrests by masked ICE agents. However, an unusually high rate of cases being dropped has some, including at least one judge, wondering whether prosecutors are making charging decisions before cases are properly investigated and vetted.",
      "Washington is unique in that it is a federal district subject to laws giving Trump power to take over the local police force for up to 30 days. The decision to use troops to try to fight crime in other Democratic-controlled cities would represent an important escalation.",
      "Although the Trump administration hasn't said what the troops would be doing and what parts of Chicago they would operate in, they have explicitly promised a surge of federal agents targeting immigration enforcement. The city's so-called sanctuary policies are among the country's strongest and bar local police from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.",
      "Chicago isn\u2019t the only Democratic-led city in Trump\u2019s sights \u2014 he\u2019s also mentioned Baltimore as a likely target. But Trump seems to harbor particular scorn for the Windy City, warning in an \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d-themed social media post earlier this month: \u201c\u2019I love the smell of deportations in the morning. Chicago about to find out why it\u2019s called the Department of WAR.\u201d",
      "The president's criticism, though, is more often focused on how the city's and state's Democratic leaders deal with crime.",
      "Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have repeatedly pointed to a drop in crime in Chicago and have asked for more federal funding for prevention programs instead of sending in the National Guard.",

      "Last year, the city had 573 homicides, or 21 per every 100,000 residents, according to the Rochester Institute of Technology. That\u2019s 25% fewer than in 2020 and was a lower rate than several other major U.S. cities. Like most big cities, violent crime isn\u2019t evenly spread out in Chicago, with most shootings happening on the South and West sides.",
      "\u201cIf it was about safety, then the Trump administration would not have slashed $158 million in federal funding for violence prevention programs this year,\u201d said Yolanda Androzzo, executive director of gun violence prevention nonprofit One Aim Illinois.",
      "After Cherry's 16-year-old daughter, Tyesa, was killed in Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast neighborhood by a stray bullet that a 14-year-old fired at rival gang members, the devastated mother moved her family to Hazel Crest, a suburb just south of the city.",
      "\u201cWe were planning for prom. She was going on to college to be a nurse,\u201d Cherry said.",
      "Her son, Tyler, was fatally shot in the driveway of the family's suburban home in 2012, 20 years after Tyesa was killed.",
      "Although her children's deaths have made Cherry an antiviolence advocate \u2014 she sits on One Aim Illinois' board \u2014 she doesn't believe bringing in troops will do anything to fight crime in Chicago, and that it could making the streets more dangerous.",
      "\u201cThey're not going to ask questions,\u201d Cherry said of the National Guard. \u201cThey are trained to kill on sight.\u201d",
      "Trevon Bosley, who was 7 years old when his 18-year-old brother, Terrell, was shot and killed in 2006 while unloading drums outside of a Church before band rehearsal, also thinks sending in troops isn't the answer.",
      "\u201cThere is so much love and so much community in Chicago,\u201d said Bosley, whose brother's killing remains unsolved. \u201cThere are communities that need help. When those resources are provided, they become just as beautiful as downtown, just as beautiful as the North Side.\u201d",
      "Like Johnson, Pritzker and other critics of the promised troop deployment, Bosley thinks better funding would make a real positive difference in parts of the city with the highest crime and poverty rates.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like we have a police shortage,\u201d Bosley said. \u201cThe National Guard and police show up after a shooting has occurred. They don\u2019t show up before. That\u2019s not stopping or saving anyone.\u201d",

      "LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J. -- Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli sparred over the economy, President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership and political division as they faced off Sunday night for the opening debate in New Jersey\u2019s high-stakes governor\u2019s race.",
      "It was a combative affair for much of the night.",
      "Ciattarelli repeatedly cast his opponent as dishonest and vague, and Sherrill questioned the former CEO\u2019s math skills and fealty to Trump. People in the crowd shouted insults at times and had to be hushed by the moderator.",
      "Security was tight at the town hall-style debate at Rider University, which played out shortly after the memorial for slain conservative leader Charlie Kirk in Arizona.",
      "The tense national climate looms over the contest in New Jersey, which has drawn intense interest from the White House, activists and political leaders on both sides with Election Day just six weeks away.",
      "Long considered a reliably blue state in national elections, New Jersey has swung between Republicans and Democrats during its odd-year gubernatorial elections. Trump lost here by just 6 points last fall, a credit to his appeal among the state\u2019s large working-class population.",
      "Here are some top takeaways from Sunday night\u2019s clash:",
      "Trump, as he often does, played a central role in the debate even while being thousands of miles away at Kirk\u2019s memorial.",
      "Over and over, Sherrill linked Ciattarelli to the Republican president and his far-right MAGA movement and his more controversial policies. It was her most consistent theme throughout the 90-minute debate and underscored the extent to which she hopes to nationalize the state contest.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll do whatever Trump tells him to do,\u201d Sherrill declared in her opening statement.",
      "Ciattarelli did not criticize Trump or break with the Republican president on any issue, expressing support for his \u201cbig, beautiful\" budget bill and his plans to end the Department of Education and revise national vaccine policies.",
      "At the same time, he described himself as \u201cindependent\u201d and tried to create some space between him and the president at times.",
      "\u201cMy job is to advocate for the 9.3 million citizens of this state, and I\u2019ll always do right by the citizens of this state, no matter who occupies the White House,\u201d Ciattarelli said.",
      "Both candidates weighed in on Kirk\u2019s death, condemned political violence and vowed to defend free speech.",
      "And yet there were few moments of unity on a night that was tense from beginning to end and featured several harsh exchanges. At one point, Sherrill questioned her opponent's math skills.",
      "\u201cI can see why your career as a CPA was so short lived, because your math just doesn\u2019t add up, Jack,\" she jabbed.",

      "She also highlighted some of Kirk\u2019s more divisive rhetoric and referenced ABC's suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel after comments that he made about Kirk's killing.",
      "\u201cI think it is fair to have free speech, but I think it should go to everyone, to Jimmy Kimmel and to myself as well,\u201d Sherrill said.",
      "While Election Day is just six weeks away, it was clear that the candidates were still working to introduce themselves to voters who may just be starting to pay attention to the off-year election.",
      "As she has for much of the campaign, Sherrill focused on her background as a Naval Academy graduate and Navy helicopter pilot. She was a federal prosecutor before being elected to Congress in 2018 in a longtime Republican-held district in northern New Jersey.",
      "\u201cI have a different kind of background, so I\u2019m going to be a different kind of governor,\u201d Sherrill said.",
      "Ciattarelli, who is in his third bid for governor, played up his family\u2019s roots in New Jersey, which he says go back a century. A certified public accountant, he owned a medical publishing company that he sold in 2017. He was a local and state elected leader before running for governor in 2017 and 2021.",
      "\u201cNew Jersey, we need change. We need a hands-on CEO governor who is from New Jersey that knows exactly what needs to be done and is willing to do it,\u201d Ciattarelli said.",
      "Rising costs were a big focus. And the candidates clashed over what \u2014 and who \u2014 is to blame.",
      "Sherrill blamed higher prices on the Republican president, his \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d and his tariffs.",
      "\u201cAll he does is say that Trump\u2019s right \u2014 it\u2019s okay to drive up your tariffs. It\u2019s okay to have the one big, beautiful bill, which drives up your health care and utility costs,\u201d she said. \u201cNot on my watch.\u201d",
      "Ciattarelli sought to link New Jersey\u2019s high tax rates to the Democrats who have run state government in recent years.",
      "\u201cThe Democrats have controlled our state legislature for 25 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democrats have controlled the executive branch, the governorship for eight years and look where we are today.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would be nominating senior White House aide Lindsey Halligan to serve as the top federal prosecutor for the Virginia office that was thrown into turmoil when its U.S. attorney was pushed out Friday.",
      "In a social media post just after he departed the White House for an event at Mount Vernon, Trump wrote he was nominating Halligan as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, writing that she \u201cwill be Fair, Smart, and will provide, desperately needed, JUSTICE FOR ALL!\u201d",
      "The announcement came as Trump pressed Attorney General Pam Bondi to move forward with pursuing cases against some of his political opponents, part of a vow for retribution that has been a theme of his return to the White House.",
      "The nomination would place one of the president\u2019s legal defenders in charge of an office in tumult over political pressure by administration officials to criminally charge New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime foe of Trump, in a mortgage fraud investigation.",
      "Erik Siebert, who had been the office\u2019s top prosecutor, resigned amid a push by Trump administration officials to bring charges in the investigation, which stems from allegations of paperwork discrepancies on James\u2019 Brooklyn townhouse and a Virginia home.",
      "The Justice Department has spent months investigating, and there\u2019s been no indication that prosecutors have managed to uncover any degree of incriminating evidence necessary to secure an indictment. James\u2019 lawyers have vigorously denied any allegations and characterized the investigation as an act of political revenge.",
      "Halligan has been part of Trump\u2019s legal orbit for the last several years, including serving as one of his attorneys in the early days of the FBI\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. She has more recently been enlisted in a White House effort to remove what the administration contends is \u201cimproper ideology\u201d from Smithsonian properties.",
      "Earlier Saturday, Trump posted to social media what appeared to be somewhat of an open letter to Bondi, saying he had \u201creviewed over 30 statements and posts\u201d that he characterized as criticizing his administration for a lack of action on investigations, including the one into James' dealings. Trump's message mentioned former FBI Director James Comey, Trump's longtime foil whom he fired during his first term amid the Russia election interference investigation.",

Comey has said he did not mean the post as a threat and removed it once he realized how it was being interpreted.",
      "Asked as he departed the White House if he was criticizing Bondi, Trump said he just wanted action.",

      "After being pulled off the air nearly a week ago, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" will return on Tuesday, The Walt Disney Company announced Monday.",
      "The late-night show had been \"pre-empted indefinitely\" last week following comments Kimmel made on the show in response to\u00a0the shooting death\u00a0of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "In a statement Monday, The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, said Kimmel's show was suspended \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" adding that some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "Kimmel had not yet commented on Monday on his show's return.",
      "The late-night host made the remarks in his monologue on Sept. 15, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\" He also mocked Mr. Trump's reaction to the shooting.",
      "Before Disney announced last week that Kimmel's show was \"pre-empted indefinitely,\" Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr called the remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" he said during a podcast interview, telling host Benny Johnson: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Kimmel faced criticism from conservatives over his comments. Mr. Trump last week had congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "ABC parent company Disney has faced fallout in Hollywood over the move: Other late-night hosts have publicly sided with Kimmel, A-listers like Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro signed an open letter calling it a \"dark moment for freedom of speech,\" and screenwriter and \"Lost\" co-creator Damon Lindelof vowed not to work with Disney unless Kimmel's show is restored. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who led Disney for more than two decades, spoke out and defended Kimmel last week, writing on X: \"Where has all the leadership gone? If not for university presidents, law firm managing partners, and corporate chief executives standing up against bullies, who then will step up for the first amendment?\"",

      "ABC's announcement last week came after media giant Nexstar announced that it would preempt Kimmel's show indefinitely on all its stations over Kimmel's remarks.

    "published": "Sun, 21 Sep 2025 10:44:59 -0400",
    "summary": "The action movie star, who tapped into some childhood trauma to play mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr in his new film, reveals that he told costar Emily Blunt and director Benny Safdie he was scared to take on the dramatic role.",
    "story": [
      "This picturesque farm in rural Virginia is Dwayne Johnson's very private sanctuary, with a well-stocked pond that he usually fishes alone. \"Just me,\" he said, \"and I'll bring the girls here, and it's magical. Just the way the property is set up, I never have to see anybody. And I know it sounds crazy, and maybe kind of weird, but that's fun for me.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does that do for you?\"",
      "\"Peace,\" he replied.",
      "Peace has been hard to come by lately. Last month, Johnson made his first trip to the Venice Film Festival, for what is probably the most ambitious film of his career, \"The Smashing Machine.\" He plays the real-life mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr, a two-time world champion who fought drug addiction and depression.",
      "Johnson endured three hours of makeup and prosthetics a day to look like Kerr, and he's never played anyone quite so real before. But it's something he says he's been aching to do.",
      "\"For years, I've been dreaming and hoping,\" he said. \"My desire was to play not only a dramatic role, but something that I felt like I could really sink my teeth into, and rip myself open. You hear that term. I just didn't want to do drama. I wanted to do something that really allowed me to do that.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Smashing Machine\" click on the player below:",
      "I asked, \"This is a big, raw role. Did you have any doubts that you could do it?\"",
      "\"When it became real, yes,\" he said.",
      "Director Benny Safdie paired Johnson with Emily Blunt as Mark Kerr's volatile wife, Dawn Staples. The two last worked together in Disney's 2021 film \"Jungle Cruise,\" the kind of film on which Johnson built his multi-billion-dollar career.",
      "\"I was chasing something for a lot of years, and what I was chasing was box office,\" he said. \"And there's a part of me, the brain [that goes], 'Don't rock the boat. Stay in this zone. Everyone's happy. You're paying the bills.' But the heart is like, 'Yeah. But you're not being fulfilled.'\"",
      "\"Did you feel like that, you weren't being fulfilled?\" I asked.",
      "\"One hundred percent,\" Johnson said. \"But I was really nervous. And on day one, I remember Benny coming to me, and Emily as well, [they] said, 'Are you scared?' I went, 'Yes.'\"",
      "\"You flat out said, 'Yes, I'm scared'?\"",
      "\"Absolutely. I am.\"",
      "And Dwayne Johnson doesn't scare easily.",
      "His father was a professional wrestler, and with dad on the road a lot of the time, young Dwayne grew up with his share of trauma. When he was 15, Dwayne and his mom were evicted from their apartment because they couldn't pay the rent.",
      "He moved around a lot, and eventually started wrestling on local TV in Memphis, which he showed us in 2022.",
      "We also saw where he stayed back then: a dilapidated trailer in nearby Mississippi.",
      "The trailer park kid fought his way out of poverty, became the wrestling legend known as \"The Rock,\" and eventually moved into movies, from action (the \"Fast and the Furious\" series) to animation (\"Moana\").",
      "For \"The Smashing Machine,\" he had to find a way to transform into someone whose whole world was coming apart, like the scene where Mark Kerr loses his first fight. To conjure up the feelings of despair on camera, Johnson knew right where to go. \"I went back to what it's like being a 15-year-old kid and coming home and being evicted,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"You said it felt like you were ripping yourself open. What do you think that did for you, Dwayne Johnson, ripping yourself open like that?\"",
      "\"The thing that I was running from, which was ripping myself open, is actually the thing that I needed the most,\" he replied, \"because it made me realize that the thing I love, which is acting and telling these stories, now I see it in a different world.\"",
      "These days, Johnson talks a lot about gratitude. At his property in Virginia, far from the trailer in Mississippi, he said, \"Even more reason to be grateful.\"",
      "One thing he won't talk about: Oscar buzz. \"No, no, I can't, I can't,\" he said. \"The thought that that is even a question? \u00a0\u2026 \u00a0You know, trailer park kid.\"",
      "The married father of three will be starting work on another \"Moana\" film soon, and also another drama. Yes, Dwayne Johnson will always be The Rock, but as any scientist can tell you, rocks can change.",
      "This Rock, for one, seems smaller now. \"Yeah. Svelte!\" he laughed. \"Because I'm preparing for a role.\"",
      "\"So, this really is, this is like a new era for you?\"",
      "\"It's a new, I wouldn't say, chapter. I would say new book. A whole new book. And I love it.\"",

      "In Priscilla Beaulieu Presley's new memoir, \"Softly, as I Leave You: Life After Elvis\" (written with Mary Jane Ross, to be published Sept. 23 by Grand Central), she recounts what she lost when she divorced the King, and how she found herself \u2013 as a single mother, businesswoman and actress.",
      "In the excerpt below, Priscilla writes about the events of August 16, 1977, when Elvis was found dead at Graceland, and the effect upon her and their daughter, Lisa Marie.",

      "On August 16, 1977, I was meeting my sister for lunch on Melrose Avenue. It was a strangely cold and damp day for summer in Los Angeles. As I neared the restaurant, Michelle was flagging me down from the corner across the street. When I came to a stop, she rushed over to the car. She told me that she'd just had a call from Dad. Joe Esposito was phoning all over, trying to get a hold of me. It was something about Elvis being in the hospital. My heart stopped. I knew Joe wouldn't be doing that if it was just another of Elvis's hospital stays. Something must be terribly wrong.",
      "I did a U-turn and raced home, running traffic lights and going far too fast. Cars skidded to a halt to miss me. It's a miracle I didn't get hit. All the way home, I prayed over and over, \"Dear God, please let it be all right.\" Lisa was at Graceland, due to come home later that day, so she was part of whatever was happening.",
      "When I reached home, I could hear the phone ringing as I got out of the car. I prayed it would keep ringing until I reached it. I let myself into the house with shaking hands and grabbed the receiver.",
      "It was Joe. I said, \"What's happened?\" He replied, \"It's Elvis.\"",
      "\"Oh my God.\"",
      "\"Cilla, he's dead. We've lost him.\" His voice broke.",
      "I began screaming, \"No! No, no, no, no, no!\" I started to sob, and I could hear Joe crying on the other end of the line.",
      "\"Joe, where's Lisa?\"",
      "\"She's okay. She's with Grandma.\" I asked Joe to send a plane for me, as quickly as he could, and hung up. The questions I needed answered would have to wait.",
      "A few minutes later, the phone rang again, and when I picked it up, I heard Lisa's voice saying, \"Mommy! Mommy! Something's happened to Daddy! Everybody's crying.\"",
      "I could hear Vernon's voice in the background, sobbing and saying, \"My son! My son!\"",
      "I told Lisa, \"I know, baby,\" and reassured her that Daddy's plane was coming for me soon. I told her to wait with Grandma until I got there. She said she was going outside to play with her friend.",
      "I hung up in a kind of daze. I couldn't absorb what Joe had told me. How could Elvis be dead? I had just talked to him two days before. He'd sounded good.",
      "Joe sent Elvis's private plane, the Lisa Marie, to pick up Michelle and me, my parents, Jerry Schilling, and a handful of other close friends to fly us to Memphis. When we got to Graceland, I found Lisa playing golf carts in the yard with one of her friends. At first, I thought it was an odd reaction, and I worried about what the paparazzi would make of Lisa playing in the wake of her father's death. But then I realized it was a child's way of escaping the reality of the silent house. I hugged her close, then went inside.",
      "I still didn't know what had happened, so Joe told me. Ginger had found Elvis unconscious, face down on the floor of the bathroom, that afternoon. She called downstairs for help, and Joe had raced upstairs. He knew immediately that Elvis had passed, but he didn't want to believe it. My heart plummeted as Joe confirmed that Lisa had seen Elvis's body. Elvis was still face down on the floor when she saw him, his face buried in the shag carpet. Lisa had been afraid he was suffocating. Joe wasn't sure if she'd understood what she was seeing. He'd sent her to see Grandma while the ambulance came. He did chest compressions while they waited for the ambulance. A doctor continued efforts to resuscitate Elvis as they raced to the hospital, but all the efforts were futile. Shortly after arrival, Elvis was pronounced dead. Apparently, it was a heart attack.",
      "Inside Graceland, the atmosphere was eerie. The house seemed hollow and dead. It was as if the energy had been sucked out of it\u2014Elvis's life force. We all walked around like zombies. Vernon was distraught. He felt Elvis's passing very, very deeply. It broke my heart to see such a strong man repeatedly call out his son's name, tears streaming down his face. He was losing his only child. A part of Vernon was lost that day as well. I never again saw the energy he once had. When- ever he'd come into a room and said, \"Hey, son,\" his face would light up with a smile. I never saw that smile again. Grandma struggled to believe that Elvis was gone. After he left us, she always carried a little handkerchief. I'd see her tearing up, and she'd wipe her eyes and whisper, \"My boy.\"",
      "There was no privacy for those of us closest to Elvis, including the family. People and cameras surrounded the property. Mourners waited to be admitted to the house for a public viewing of Elvis's open casket. The funeral was a nationally televised event. The streets near Graceland were thronged with tens of thousands of people. The crowds were so large by the second day that President Jimmy Carter called up the Air National Guard to help local police. It was hot and muggy, and some in the crowd fainted from the heat and from emotion. In the afternoon, thousands of people filed past the open casket that had been set up in the front hall. Lisa stayed with Elvis's body as much as she could. She didn't want to leave him. We sat on the stairs and watched as people walked by. Crowds of strangers in Elvis's home, crying and paying their respects. Some mourners had walked away from their jobs to drive sixteen hours or more to Memphis and line up along Elvis Presley Boulevard, hoping to be admitted to the house. The trip was a financial sacrifice for many of them, for much of the crowd was made up of the everyday people who identified with Elvis as one of their own. He, too, had come from poverty. He had remained loyal to his hometown and his family, and he never got above his upbringing. They felt compelled to pay their respects as they would to a family member. It was overwhelming. There wasn't room yet for our own grief.",
      "His memorial was an international event. While mourners gathered in Memphis, Christ's Church in London held a service in Elvis's honor. Over five hundred people crowded the sanctuary and the lawn outside. At the close of the service, they all sang \"Amazing Grace\" in his honor. Elvis's passing was felt not just in Memphis, but around the world.",
      "The private funeral service was held in the living room and adjoining music room, with the peacock glass framing an archway between the two. Elvis's coffin was moved into the room for the service. Vernon had hired a local preacher who didn't know Elvis and who talked primarily about Elvis's legendary generosity. The Blackwood Brothers, longtime friends and backup singers for Elvis, sang gospel songs. I sat on the couch with Lisa and Vernon, numb with grief. It was all a blur at the time, and it still is.",
      "Lisa and I waited until we could be alone with Elvis to say goodbye. I had bought a silver bracelet engraved with the words, \"I love you, Daddy,\" for Lisa to give him. I helped her put it around his wrist. Then we each kissed him one last time. I'm not sure it hit me until then that he was really gone. The body I had held and caressed so many times was now stiff and empty. It was an eerie, aching feeling.",
      "A line of white Cadillacs formed the funeral procession to the Forest Hill Cemetery. Lisa and I rode with Vernon in the car immediately following the hearse. Elvis was entombed in the Presley family crypt with his mother. Two days later, after two thieves tried to steal the coffin, he was moved to the Meditation Garden at Graceland and kept under security. Gladys was moved to Graceland shortly afterward, to lie beside him. Elvis and I used to sit in that garden in the small hours of the morning, in the peace and the moonlight. I was glad they had brought him home.",
      "Vernon had a bronze plaque made to cover the coffin, with an inscription ending, \"We miss you, Son and Daddy.\"",
      "I returned home to LA with Lisa, feeling that a large part of me had died with Elvis. I couldn't accept that he had passed. I'd felt Elvis would always be there. He was such a force of nature. Despite all my fears for him, I never thought he would die at the age he did. He was still so young. He'd talked so much about what he still wanted to do. He had plans for his music and for his life. Elvis wasn't ready to leave. I wasn't ready.",
      "It was a constant battle to accept that he was gone. Every morning, I would wake up and remember, \"Oh God, Elvis isn't here anymore. How can I live knowing that?\" I was frightened to be in a world without Elvis in it.",
      "There would be no more calls. I would never again pick up the phone and hear his voice. There would be no more visits, no more dropping by unexpectedly. I wouldn't be going to Graceland anymore, except to visit Grandma and Vernon. There was no more Memphis Mafia. Everybody scattered. Everything changed. I changed. I had been happy-go-lucky, always excited about where we were going or what we were doing next. I had finally adjusted to the separation, feeling free and adventurous. Optimistic. My memories of Elvis had been happy ones. When I went somewhere we'd been, I would think, \"Oh my gosh, we went here.\" I remembered the times fans would cling to him and want pictures. They loved him and didn't want to let him go, and when he tried to escape, a trail of girls would follow him. It had been fun. He had so much charm and was so generous to loved ones and strangers alike. It filled him with joy when he was able to do something special for other people.",
      "Now my mind was filled with images of loss. I couldn't get away from reminders of him. The media was filled with articles and broadcasts about Elvis, and his songs flooded the radio stations. If I went out, people would come over and say, \"I'm so sorry.\" I knew they meant well, but it was painful. For a long time after Elvis passed, I rarely went anywhere. I waited a while to continue with my life.",
      "Worst of all, I no longer had a father for my daughter. I was raising my child by myself, a brokenhearted child who had lost her daddy. When we got back home from the funeral, we were surrounded by reminders of his passing. I had to protect her from all the news reports, the unwanted attention, the nonstop condolence calls. It seemed like every newspaper and magazine had a headline about his passing. If Lisa and I went to the grocery store, I'd pull the ones with headlines out of the rack and turn them around in the checkout line so Lisa wouldn't see them. To get her away from the constant reminders, I decided to send her to summer camp. I hoped it would not only insulate her from the publicity but also take her mind off her thoughts. Joanie's kids and some of her other friends were there. I checked on her regularly at camp, and she seemed to be doing pretty well. She later said that camp had helped. When it ended for the summer, my sister and I took her out of the country to give her some privacy until the incessant publicity died down. We went to England and later to Europe. We were seldom recognized there, and we could explore the sights in peace.",

    "summary": "In her new book, Priscilla Presley writes what she calls her final telling of what it was like to be a queen to the King, and what came after.",
    "story": [
      "It was a truly Vegas affair at the Aladdin Hotel; Elvis in a paisley tux, Priscilla with a rhinestone tiara. By the time they'd met, when Priscilla Beaulieu was just 14, Elvis Presley had already gyrated his way into pop culture, from his music to his movies.",
      "He redefined what celebrity was, and yet, Hollywood was no place for him. \"He would always go back to Memphis; that's where home was,\" said Priscilla.",
      "Priscilla met Elvis while he was in the Army stationed in Germany. The only thing that made more news than their relationship was their divorce in 1973. \"I mean, I was very much in love with Elvis, very much,\" said Priscilla, now 80. \"I am still very much in love with him. I didn't leave him because I didn't love him; I just couldn't live the life.\"",
      "Her split from Elvis is where she begins \"Softly, as I Leave You\" (to be published Tuesday), what she says is her final telling of what it was like to be a queen to the King, and what came after. \"I was living Elvis' life,\" she said. \"It was all about him. I had to find me. Who was I? I was Elvis' wife. I don't think we could ever have a life that I wanted. I wanted him for myself.\"",
      "But so did his fans. Elvis, it seemed was destined to be shared. \"I thought, well, what if he runs into someone he falls in love with?\" said Priscilla. \"And I mentioned it to him, and he goes, 'You don't have to worry. You never have to worry.' But when you see these beautiful girls hanging out, I'm going,\u00a0Could that be the one?",
      "\"I couldn't live a life of being in panic all the time, of losing him to someone else,\" she said.",
      "There were affairs on both sides, and yet after their divorce, they still couldn't quit each other. They stayed uncommonly close. Neither ever remarried. \"We couldn't find anyone else!\" she laughed.",
      "She started businesses, and began taking acting classes. She says it helped with her shyness, and grew her confidence. She was also busy raising her and Elvis' only daughter, Lisa Marie. They had joint custody for nearly four years \u2026 before it all ended.",
      "At age 42, Elvis was gone.",
      "Priscilla had seen the changes \u2013 the bloating, the slurred words, the drugs.",
      "I asked, \"Was there anybody around him who could convince him to stop?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"You couldn't convince Elvis on anything unless he believed in it or, you know, thought about it.\"",
      "She said doctors would basically give him anything he wanted, enabling him. \"He was Elvis; you're not going to say no to Elvis,\" she said.",
      "In his absence sat Graceland, the Memphis mansion that had been hemorrhaging money. The urge was to sell. Priscilla said, \"And I looked at the guy who was telling me, the attorney, and I said, 'That will never happen, ever.'\"",
      "Instead, she opened it to the public. It went from a home to a family shrine.",
      "By the time Lisa Marie turned 25, Elvis' inheritance was hers. It was 1993, the same year another King popped the question \u2026 the King of Pop, Michael Jackson.",
      "Priscilla recalled, \"We were walking on the beach, and she said, 'Mom, you know, Michael wants to get married.' I said, 'Lisa, I'm not really for it.' And she goes, 'Why not.' And I go, 'Who are you? Michael Jackson, Lisa Presley?' And I knew that Michael loved attention, which he did. I knew that's the reason why. They didn't even know each other that long.\"",
      "Priscilla was no fan of another celebrity, O.J. Simpson. She worked with him on the \"Naked Gun\" series. \"He could be very, very nice, but I just didn't, I just felt something about him in the way he was with his wife, and it didn't set well with me,\" she said.",
      "That said, Priscilla was a huge fan of co-star Leslie Nielsen.",
      "Before \"Naked Gun,\" Priscilla had never done comedy. She was thought of in most circles as a more serious actor after her role in \"Dallas\" a few years before.",
      "\"Dallas\" was a spotlight the size of Texas, and Priscilla's role as Jenna Wade put her in the pop zeitgeist all over again.",
      "She left the series after having her second child, Navarone, with her longtime partner Marco Garibaldi.",
      "In 2023, her last physical link with Elvis left. Lisa Marie Presley died suddenly at her home in California from complications after bariatric surgery, and once again the Presley name was draped in grief.",
      "\"I miss her every day,\" Priscilla said. \"I miss her, but I have to let that go and live my life. But her spirit is still with me very, very much.\"",
      "She's buried at Graceland, like her dad. Priscilla says she will be there one day, too. For her, the first home she had as a married woman will be her last.\u00a0 That's not looking backward, she says; it's a comfort for the future.",
      "\"When you stop and think about it, we're not here that long. We're not,\" Priscilla said. \"All of a sudden we're older and we think, Wow, I don't want to hold on to bad things. I don't want to hold on to, you know, things that are in the past that happened. I want to move forward.\"",

    "story": [
      "There was a warm glow in the mountains above Sundance this past week: Hundreds standing in line for a chairlift vigil to honor a man whose legacy is as solid as the mountain itself.",
      "Robert Redford spent most of his life up in the Utah mountains. It's where \"Sunday Morning\" first met him back in 1994.",
      "There was a gentleness between him and our Charles Kuralt; the outdoors meant the world to both of them.",
      "\"Every time I come up this canyon, every time I see that, and feel it, I realize that I'm not taking it for granted,\" Redford said.",
      "For someone so big, so famous, so incandescent, he seemed heroically untouchable, and yet, he was always more than gracious with us.",
      "Years after that first interview, he sat down with our Rita Braver, and a few years after that, he met with me.",
      "Across the decades, he never really changed; his passions, his principles, his politics \u2014 each was as firmly grounded as he was.",
      "As a kid growing up in Southern California, he'd watch other stars romance their way across the screen; frankly back then, he thought it was all pretty silly. \"Any time there was a love scene on the screen, we'd go, Aww! Boo! You tell him lover! And make fun of the scene,\" Redford said. \"Suddenly, the idea that I would be that guy was just too much for me to take.\"",
      "He wasn't always the heartthrob, of course, especially in his later works. In \"All Is Lost,\" it was all him. For an hour and forty-five minutes, he rarely even spoke, but we watched, because it was Redford.",
      "He was 77 when he shot that. He was 81 when he did \"The Old Man and the Gun.\" It was that film, he told us, that would likely be his last. As hard as it was for us to hear him say that, Redford replied, \"It's hard for me to say it! Well, yeah, it's hard to talk about your end. I mean, who does?\"",
      "Among his more than 80 films, many have become classics. He defined what a leading man was.",
      "And yet, when it came to his cultivation of younger filmmakers, celebrity was never a part of the conversation.",
      "His Sundance Institute wasn't looking for stars; it was looking for storytellers.",
      "Glenn Close was in it from the beginning. \"I think he's an extraordinary man,\" she told us last January. \"And I think the fact that he put his money and his time and his influence where his mouth was in this industry is remarkable.\"",
      "His activism left us with a lot to think about \u2013 our place in the word, the false pride of celebrity, the need for wild places.",
      "At a time when Hollywood voices are being discounted, Robert Redford's legacy reminds us that a voice in the wilderness can indeed echo a long way.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Sep 2025 14:07:05 -0400",
    "summary": "His music dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, as an early bandmate of Buddy Holly, and the writer of such classic songs as \"I Fought the Law.\" But Sonny Curtis' most memorable composition may be a TV theme song that turned the world on with a smile.",
    "story": [
      "The theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" is familiar to generations of TV watchers. The name of the man who wrote and sang it, less so.",
      "Who can turn the world on with her smile?Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?Well, it's you, girl, and you should know itWith each glance and every little movement you show it",
      "Love is all around, no need to waste itYou can have the town, why don't you take itYou're gonna make it after all",
      "But by the time Sonny Curtis recorded \"Love Is All Around\" in 1970, he'd \"made it\" several times over himself, as a songwriter, as a recording artist, and as an early bandmate of the legendary Buddy Holly.",
      "Born in 1937 in rural West Texas, Curtis grew up picking cotton on his father's farm. \"Oh, it was a miserable job,\" he told correspondent Mo Rocca. \"The heavier the cotton sack gets, the worse it is, man.\"",
      "His love of music came from family. His aunt taught him to play the guitar, and while working those fields, Curtis dreamed up his own songs: \"Driving a tractor, you go down half a mile that way, and when you get there, you turn around and come back a half mile this way. You have plenty of time to write a song!\"",
      "Curtis was just 14 when he met a young Buddy Holly in nearby Lubbock. \"Buddy had black hair, but he had dyed it blonde, and it was growing out. And he reminded me of a black-and-tan coon hound. We sorta skipped all the niceties and got our guitars and started playing.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"How quickly did you realize this guy's serious about music?\"",
      "\"Buddy, he exuded confidence. He just knew he was gonna make it big one day.\"",
      "The two became fast friends, bonded by their love of music. Sometimes, Curtis said, he'd spend the night at Buddy's. The two would wake up at midnight and flip on the car radio for a show out of Shreveport, Louisiana, to hear some of the rhythm and blues voices that would shape rock 'n' roll: \"We heard, oh, Big Mama Thornton and Lonnie Johnson, and Lead Belly, Little Richard, Ray Charles, you name it.\"",
      "\"Were you just absorbing this?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"Oh, boy, were we ever, yeah!\"",
      "Buddy and Sonny had formed a band and were still figuring out their own sound, when a then little-known Elvis Presley came to town. \"And I mean, the girls were goin' nuts, man. And that really got our attention. All a sudden, we thought, this not only involves music, this involves pretty girls!\"",
      "When Elvis came back to town in 1956, Buddy and Sonny's band was the opening act. \"Well, I guess we were right there sort of at the beginning of rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "\"What was Elvis like backstage?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"He was just an old boy.\"",
      "The band went on to record some demos, but wasn't making much money.",
      "So, Curtis left to tour with country star Slim Whitman. \"He treated me kind of like a little brother,\" Curtis said. \"I remember I'd be on the stage and he'd come over and say, 'Now don't be nervous.'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Buddy Holly formed a new band, which would prove to be seminal. The Crickets shot to fame, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"When that was happening, did you feel a little left out, like, 'Ugh'?\"",
      "\"I did feel kind of like the train left the station and I wasn't on it, you know?\" Curtis replied.",
      "But on February 3, 1959, Curtis' friend and former bandmate died in a plane crash near Clear Lake Iowa.",
      "Curtis served as a pallbearer.",
      "\"Buddy Holly was 22 when he died,\" Rocca said.",
      "\"Yes. Can you imagine the amount of music he pumped into the system in a short period of, like, 18 months? No telling how much he would've contributed had he been around.\"",
      "By that time, Curtis had joined the Crickets. But with Holly gone, the band felt rudderless.",
      "It was Curtis' talent for songwriting that helped put the wind back in his sails. His song \"Walk Right Back'' became a big hit for the Everly Brothers:",
      "And then there's this classic, which Curtis claims he wrote in about 20 minutes: \"I Fought the Law\":",
      "\"I Fought the Law\" has been covered by artists from The Bobby Fuller Four to The Clash.",
      "Sonny Curtis is 84 now. He and Louise, his wife of more than 50 years, live outside Nashville, where they raised their daughter, Sarah. He is enshrined in Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame \u2013 as is his old guitar.",
      "In 2012, the year the Crickets retired, they were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.",
      "But it's a song Curtis wrote for the small screen that may be his most enduring legacy.",
      "In 1970, he was living in Los Angeles when he got a call from a friend about a new sitcom being produced for Mary Tyler Moore: \"It was just this young girl gets jilted in this small community, and she moves to the big city of Minneapolis, gets a job at a news station. And that was about it.\"",
      "Curtis wrote the theme song based on a four-page description of the show. \"I honed in on the part that she rented an apartment she had a hard time affording, and wrote, 'How will you make it on your own?' \u2026 'This world is awfully big, and girl, this time you're all alone.'\"",
      "Within just a few hours, Curtis was summoned to the studio to play his song for producer James L. Brooks. Curtis recalled, \"I got my guitar out and I sang it to him. He smiled and said, 'Sing that again.' And I had to sing it about ten times. And before I left that afternoon, the room was full of people standing all around the walls. I thought, 'I believe I got a shot at this!'\"",
      "WEB EXTRA: Sonny Curtis on writing the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" theme song",
      "Rocca said, \"It wasn't a given that you'd write and sing it.\"",
      "\"No. As a matter of fact they didn't want me to sing it. I said, 'I wanna sing this,' you know? And I was probably more pushy than I should have been, if I'da known better. But fortunately, I didn't know better at the time!\"",
      "When the show became a hit, Curtis was asked to rework his song: \"When they started to do the second season, he said, 'Sonny, she's obviously made it. And we have to have some new lyrics.'\"",
      "For a man whose career dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, Sonny Curtis remains disarmingly humble. \"Oh, I've always sort of had a rule, don't give advice in a crowd,\" he laughed.",
      "But when pressed, he will share some wisdom: \"If they say, 'Man, you oughta go back to Texas 'cause you'll never make it,' just look at them and say, 'No, you're wrong, because I am gonna make it.'\"",
      "Rocca replied, \"You know, I should write this down, 'cause this sounds like a song right here!\"",

    "story": [
      "Sonny Curtis, a vintage rock 'n' roller who wrote the raw classic \"I Fought the Law\" and posed the enduring question \"Who can turn the world on with her smile?\" as the writer-crooner of the theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" has died at 88.",
      "Curtis, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Crickets in 2012, died Friday, his wife of more than a half-century, Louise Curtis, confirmed to The Associated Press. A statement from his family on his Facebook page Saturday said that he had become suddenly ill.",
      "\"He made a mark on this world, and he made a mark on the hearts of all who knew him. It's a sad day, but what a life. May we look at his life with joy rather than sadness. He would have wanted that,\" the statement read.",
      "The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum also acknowledged Curtis' death.",
      "\"Sonny Curtis was a gentle, humble man who wrote extraordinary songs,\" said Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, in a statement.",
      "Curtis wrote or co-wrote hundreds of songs, from Keith Whitley's country smash \"I'm No Stranger to the Rain\" to the Everly Brothers' \"Walk Right Back,\" a personal favorite Curtis completed while in Army basic training. Bing Crosby, Glen Campbell, Bruce Springsteen and the Grateful Dead were among other artists who covered his work.",
      "Curtis' start with Buddy Holly",
      "Born during the Great Depression to cotton farmers outside of Meadow, Texas, Curtis was a childhood friend of Buddy Holly's and an active musician in the formative years of rock, whether jamming on guitar with Holly in the mid-1950s or opening for Elvis Presley when Elvis was still a regional act. Curtis' songwriting touch also soon emerged: Before he turned 20, he had written the hit \"Someday\" for Webb Pierce and \"Rock Around With Ollie Vee\" for Holly.",
      "Curtis had left Holly's group, the Crickets, before Holly became a major star. But he returned after Holly died in a plane crash in 1959 and he was featured the following year on the album \"In Style with the Crickets,\" which included \"I Fought the Law\" (dashed off in a single afternoon, according to Curtis, who would say he had no direct inspiration for the song) and the Jerry Allison collaboration \"More Than I Can Say,\" a hit for Bobby Vee, and later for Leo Sayer.",
      "Meanwhile, it took until 1966 for \"I Fought the Law\" and its now-immortal refrain \"I fought the law \u2014 and the law won\" to catch on: The Texas-based Bobby Fuller Four made it a Top 10 song. Over the following decades, it was covered by dozens of artists, from punk (the Clash) to country (Johnny Cash, Nanci Griffith) to Springsteen, Tom Petty and other mainstream rock stars.",
      "\"It's my most important copyright,\" Curtis told The Tennessean in 2014.",
      "\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\"",
      "Curtis' other signature song was as uplifting as \"I Fought the Law\" was resigned. In 1970, he was writing commercial jingles when he came up with the theme for a new CBS sitcom starring Moore as a single woman hired as a TV producer in Minneapolis. He called the song \"Love is All Around,\" and used a smooth melody to eventually serve up lyrics as indelible as any in television history:",
      "\"Who can turn the world on with her smile? / Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile? / Well it's you girl, and you should know it / With each glance and every little movement you show it.\"",
      "The song's endurance was sealed by the images it was heard over, especially Moore's triumphant toss of her hat as Curtis proclaims, \"You're going to make it after all.\" In tribute, other artists began recording it, including Sammy Davis Jr., Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Minnesota's H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. A commercial release featuring Curtis came out in 1980 and was a modest success, peaking at No. 29 on Billboard's country chart.",
      "Curtis would recall being commissioned by his friend Doug Gilmore, a music industry road manager who had heard the sitcom's developers were looking for an opening song.",
      "\"Naturally I said yes, and later that morning, he dropped off a four-page format \u2014 you know 'Girl from the Midwest, moves to Minneapolis, gets a job in a newsroom, can't afford her apartment etc.,' which gave me the flavor of what it was all about,\" said Curtis, who soon met with show co-creator (and later Oscar-winning filmmaker) James L. Brooks.",
      "\"James L. Brooks came into this huge empty room, no furniture apart from a phone lying on the floor, and at first, I thought he was rather cold and sort of distant, and he said 'We're not at the stage of picking a song yet, but I'll listen anyway,'\" Curtis recalled. \"So I played the song, just me and my guitar, and next thing, he started phoning people, and the room filled up, and then he sent out for a tape recorder.\"",
      "Curtis would eventually write two versions: the first used in Season 1, the second and better known for the remaining six seasons. The original words were more tentative, opening with \"How will you make it on your own?\" and ending with \"You might just make it after all.\" By Season 2, the show was a hit and the lyrics were reworked. The producers had wanted Andy Williams to sing the theme song, but he turned it down and Curtis' easygoing baritone was heard instead.",
      "Solo career",
      "Curtis made a handful of solo albums, including \"Sonny Curtis\" and \"Spectrum,\" and hit the country Top 20 with the 1981 single \"Good Ol' Girls.\" In later years, he continued to play with Allison and other members of the Crickets. The band released several albums, among them \"The Crickets and Their Buddies,\" featuring appearances by Eric Clapton, Graham Nash and Phil Everly. One of Curtis' more notable songs was \"The Real Buddy Holly Story,\" a rebuke to the 1978 biopic \"The Buddy Holly Story,\" which starred Gary Busey.",
      "Curtis settled in Nashville in the mid-1970s and lived there with his wife, Louise. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1991 and, as part of the Crickets, into Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007. Five years later, he and the Crickets were inducted into the Rock Hall, praised as \"the blueprint for rock and roll bands (that) inspired thousands of kids to start up garage bands around the world.\"",

      "At 24 years old, Young may appear to be an overnight sensation after her breakout hit \"Messy\" went viral online and topped charts around the world, but she has been writing songs since age 11. Her recent debut at Coachella left her stunned by the massive audience response.",
      "\"I felt a bit confused to be honest,\" Young told \"CBS Mornings\" about her April performance. \"It was absolutely bonkers. Just the amount of people that were standing there screaming. It was like, 'For me, like, what?' Do you know what I mean?\"",

      "Earlier this month, a jury found Cardi B not liable after deliberating for less than an hour in a California civil trial. A security guard had accused the rapper of assault, and her testimony went viral when she candidly admitted to calling the security guard names.",
      "\"When the attorney asked me, like, 'What was you calling her?' You cannot sit here and lie and be like, 'I wasn't calling her no names.' That's not the truth,\" she said. \"I said what I said for real. Like, just don't lie.\"",

      "\"You can't always bottle it inside, because that turns you crazy. That's why some celebrities, they do drugs, they start developing mental issues and stuff like that,\" she said. \"You have to say it. Let it out.\"",
      "The rapper said she sometimes wants to \"go off the grid\" and disappear to a Caribbean island for a year because of the constant scrutiny, but refuses to give up because of what it would teach her daughter.",
      "\"Imagine one day me telling my daughter that. Like, it's like, 'Oh, why'd I give up? Because I couldn't take it.' That's me raising her to be weak on criticism,\" she said.",

      "Governors of the states, which make up the newly-formed West Coast Health Alliance, said in a joint press statement that their alliance was \"fighting back against the Trump administration's assault on science.\" Earlier this month, the states announced the formation of the alliance as a response to what it called the \"weaponization\" of the CDC, spearheaded by Health Secretary and vocal vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Kennedy's moves included firing all 17 members of the CDC's vaccine recommendations committee\u00a0and\u00a0replacing them with apointees that include vaccine skeptics, and\u00a0rolling back recommendations on who should receive COVID vaccines.",
      "\"Public health leaders warn these moves dismantle independent, science-based oversight and inject politics into decisions that protect Americans' health \u2014 undermining the CDC's credibility at a moment when trust and clarity are most needed,\" the alliance said Wednesday.",
      "The West Coast Health Alliance's recommendations for respiratory viruses say the COVID vaccine should be given to \"all who choose protection,\" and specifically children 6 months to 23 months old, all adults over 65, those younger than 65 with risk factors, and anyone pregnant or planning to get pregnant.",

      "\"Democrat-run states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates, and draconian vaccine passports during the COVID era completely eroded the American people's trust in public health agencies,\" Nixon said. \"HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic.\"",

    "summary": "Heavy new H-1B visa fee raises numerous questions, immigration law experts told CBS News. Here's what employees and employers should know.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications is sowing confusion among some immigrant workers and their employers, including whether it's safe for current holders of the visa to travel outside the U.S.",
      "The new fee, which President Trump announced in a proclamation on Friday, represents a major change to a 35-year-old program that has enabled millions of immigrants to work legally in the U.S. The visa has become a mainstay in the technology industry, including among bellwethers such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, and is also widely used in the financial sector.",
      "Over the weekend, the White House sought to\u00a0clarify\u00a0the new policy, stating that the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and that it is a one-time cost required only when initially applying for the visa.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said the addition of a $100,000 charge for H-1B visas on top of the existing fees reflects President Trump's promise \"to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "She added, \"The text of the proclamation is very clear, and it is unfortunate that uninformed reporters and corporate lawyers attempt to sow chaos and confusion. Americans have another reason to celebrate unprecedented action by President Trump to protect Americans from cheap foreign labor.\"",
      "After the White House outlined the new policy on Friday, some tech companies including Google and Microsoft this weekend instructed H-1B employees who were traveling outside the U.S. to return immediately, expressing concern they might not be allowed to re-enter without the $100,000 payment, according to workers and immigration lawyers.",
      "Despite the White House's clarification that the new fee applies only to new visa applications, not existing H-1B holders, there remains \"a great degree of uncertainty on the ground,\" Parul Koul, president of the union that represents employees at Google owner Alphabet, said during a press conference on Monday to address the new policy.",
      "CBS News spoke with attorneys and other sources about the new policy \u2014 here's what to know.",
      "Who pays the $100,000 fee?",
      "Under current H-1B rules, employers pay the application fees on behalf of workers. Assuming that approach continues, that could deter many employers from picking up the additional $100,000 fees \u2014 roughly 10 times what they previously paid for an applicant, Emily Neumann, an immigration attorney and managing partner at Houston-based Reddy Neumann Brown, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Very few employers would be willing to shell out that kind of money,\" she said.",
      "Such an outcome would appear to align with the White House's goals of spurring employers to hire within the U.S. rather than recruiting foreign workers.",
      "\"It is therefore necessary to impose higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers,\" Mr. Trump said in his order.",
      "When does the fee go into effect?",
      "The new fee must be paid in submitting any new H-1B visa application and went into effect at 12:01 am EST on Sept. 21, according to a White House\u00a0statement.",
      "Each year, the federal government approves 85,000 H-1B visas for highly skilled non-U.S. workers, who typically require at least a bachelor's degree and a skill in a highly specialized field,\u00a0according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. An estimated 700,000 people in the U.S. hold a H-1B visa, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The USCIS says it has already reached its applicant cap for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That means those applications would be excluded from having to pay the fee, but new applicants filing during the next fiscal year would be subject to it, Neumann explained.",
      "What are the main issues for current H-1B holders?",
      "According to the White House, the proclamation \"does not prevent any holder of a current H-1B visa from traveling in and out of the United States.\"",
      "H-1B visas are valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years. A White House official said the one-time $100,000 fee is only charged when applying for a visa for the first time \u2014 the payment is not required for current visa holders or those renewing the document, and those fees aren't changing.",
      "Yet the new rules leave some gray areas for current H-1B holders, Neumann said. For instance, the new fee is targeted at new visa applicants residing outside the U.S. That raises questions about whether current H-1B visa holders who are applying for changes, such as a visa renewal or a change of employer, might be caught up in the new requirement if they leave the U.S., Neumann and other immigration attorneys said.",
      "\"Where the question comes in is, what if after September 21 they file that extension and then they need to travel \u2014 are they going to be expected to pay that in order to get back into the U.S.?\" she said. \"That's kind of an open question right now.\"",
      "Although the White House said the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and won't impact their travel, Neumann said she believes more guidance is needed because the White House's Sept. 21 FAQ notes the fee applies to \"any other H-1B petitions submitted after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025.\"",
      "\"This makes it sound like it could apply to an employee who travels with any petition filed after September 21, 2025. Although it seems clear that it does not apply to individuals currently in the United States, it is not clear how it impacts those who later travel and have a petition filed after the relevant date,\" she said.",
      "For now, Neumann said she is advising her corporate clients to direct their H-1B employees not to leave the U.S.. That was echoed by Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and an immigration attorney.",
      "\"Until we have more clarification, which hopefully we'll have soon, we're telling people to just sit tight and not travel,\" Joseph said.",
      "Asked about the issue of H-1B holders who are applying for a change and who travel outside the U.S., the White House said the one-time $100,000 fee doesn't apply to renewals or current visa holders.",
      "How does the new fee impact the H-1B program?",
      "The $100,000 fee is likely to have a \"chilling effect\" on skilled foreign workers moving to the U.S.,\u00a0Joseph of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said.",
      "Although the tech industry has long been the biggest beneficiary of the H-1B program, the visa is designed for highly skilled workers across many industries, he added. Employers who rely on the visa include those in health care, which often recruit medical professionals outside the U.S. in areas where they have shortages, he said.",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders come from a range of countries, including Canada, South Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a 2022 USCIS\u00a0report.",
      "What about the national security exemption?",
      "A provision in Mr. Trump's proclamation exempts some workers, companies and even entire industries from the new $100,000 fee if they are deemed to support the \"national interest\" and are adjudged not to pose a threat to the security or welfare of the U.S.",
      "For now, however, it's unclear how to receive such an exemption, including which federal agency will be charged with approving them, Neumann said.",
      "\"There's no guidance out there yet,\" she said. \"What are the national interest exemptions going to be? How would a company apply for that, if they can get the entire company to get the exemption? How would the individual apply?\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to questions about how the national security exemption would be applied or which agency will be handling the issue.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-algorithm-us-china-deal-trump/",
    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 17:12:12 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok includes new stipulations over who controls the social media company's algorithm, a closely guarded secret which has proved to be a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "In the meantime, a senior White House official said Monday that the U.S. and China had reached agreement on the basic details of the app's ownership. The new structure will move TikTok's U.S. operations under a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S. that will control the algorithm and oversee security, the official said.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will control the TikTok algorithm?",
      "According to the White House official, the new arrangement will operate and control a copy of the algorithm. Software maker Oracle will \"provide sort of top to bottom security\" throughout the company, the official said, noting that will involve monitoring the technology as well as managing how American data is stored.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the White House official said.",
      "Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "Mr. Trump, asked last week about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. Last week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, last week told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "Asked about this structure last week, Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, told CBS MoneyWatch that as she understands it, ByteDance would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use the algorithm under certain terms.",
      "\"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it,\" she said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch before details of the new structure were announced.",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, said the new arrangement has to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",

    "story": [
      "After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising.",
      "The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue.",
      "Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions.",
      "Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission.",
      "No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined.",
      "The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive.",
      "If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology \u2014 a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would \"invite disruption and damage\" to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years.",
      "Google believes it has already made enough changes to its \"Ad Manager\" system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling.",
      "The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct.",
      "In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month.",
      "Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist \u2014 a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion \u2014 an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April.",
      "In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial.",
      "As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's \"radical\" proposals.",
      "The Justice Department is \"fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,\" Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial.",

      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",

      "Users are able to connect their glasses to the \"Be My Eyes\" app which connects blind and visually impaired users with volunteers to assist with recognizing objects and managing everyday tasks in real time. Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail. For Lakrout, having access to text-based information like signs in a subway station or on street corners is what makes AI technology useful. She says Meta's AI glasses are bringing blind communities one step closer to accessing this information.",

When using some of the AI-powered features, the glasses' battery died, and so she regularly had to keep them in their case to charge.",
      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence. But in the end, the glasses do not \"replace the need for human capacity,\" Riccobo said. \"So we need to teach blind people and we still need to make sure that blind people develop the skills that blind people need to be successful.\"",

      "The two hospitals that treated Cochran-Zipp at the time determined that she qualified for 100% financial assistance, since her income as a college student was extremely low. Not having to worry about the roughly $100,000 in bills she racked up for her care was an enormous relief, she said.",
      "Then she started receiving unexpected bills from doctors who worked at the hospitals but, because they weren't on staff there, didn't have to abide by the facilities' financial assistance policies.",
      "Those bills, which came from specialists in emergency medicine, anesthesiology, and radiology who treated her, totaled more than $5,000. Although it was a fraction of the total cost of her care, to Cochran-Zipp it was an enormous amount. She went on payment plans and used scholarship and COVID stimulus money to help cover the bills.",
      "Cochran-Zipp, now 25 and working at a community health center, is applying to medical schools and hopes to enroll next fall. Her experience as a patient has shaped how she thinks about becoming a doctor.",
      "\"I don't think that I could be a provider that, in good conscience, charges patients money in addition to the hospital fees,\" she said.",
      "Hospital financial assistance programs are commonplace, and many patients rely on them. Most offer varying amounts of financial help to uninsured and lower-income people. Eligibility is typically based on a sliding income scale. Some hospitals apply other tests, such as residency.",
      "But even if people qualify for assistance, they may not get discounts. That's because many physicians working at but not for a hospital aren't bound by its financial assistance policies. Hospitals themselves might limit the types of services eligible for discounted or \"charity care,\" as it's sometimes called.",
      "\"It's a hole in the system,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation, a nonprofit that helps patients with serious illnesses cover their medical bills. Case managers who work with patients report that they've seen these problems repeatedly, Donovan said.",
      "In the coming years, more patients will encounter difficulties as demand for financial assistance grows. More than 14 million people are projected to lose health insurance over the next decade, primarily because of changes to the federal Medicaid program and state insurance marketplaces in recently passed tax and spending legislation championed by the Trump administration. Some of these people will likely qualify for discounted care.",
      "Nonprofit hospitals do not pay taxes on the money they make, but to maintain that tax-exempt status, they are required to have policies to help patients pay for emergency and other medically necessary care. For-profit hospitals are not required to offer financial assistance to needy patients, but many do.",
      "However, physicians and other providers who work in a hospital as independent contractors rather than as employees are often not subject to a hospital's financial assistance policy. According to an analysis by the Lown Institute, a health care think tank, physician services in the emergency, radiology, anesthesia, and pathology specialties are commonly excluded from hospital charity care.",
      "For example, at Hartford HealthCare, a large nonprofit health system serving Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, services performed by physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants employed by HHC, including emergency department physicians at four of its hospitals, are covered by its financial assistance policy. But treatment by emergency physicians at three HHC hospitals is not covered by the financial assistance policy, since they are not employees. Care by doctors working in radiology, pathology, and anesthesia isn't covered by the financial assistance policy at any HHC facility.",
      "Hartford HealthCare declined to comment on the record for this article.",
      "Health system researchers have identified another potential barrier to patients' receiving help from hospital financial assistance policies. IRS rules require that nonprofit hospitals include emergency and medically necessary care in their charity care policies, but they give hospitals substantial leeway to define what \"medically necessary\" care means.",
      "Historically, excluded care has been limited to services that insurance doesn't typically cover, like cosmetic surgery or experimental treatment. But in recent years, hospitals appear to be defining medically necessary care more narrowly, eliminating financial assistance for care that is needed but not urgently required. Care that might fall into this category could be a kidney stone removal, a cancer biopsy, or a cardiac valve replacement, according to a study published this year in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Although the study of 209 nonprofit hospitals with more than 200 beds found only isolated examples of hospitals \u2014 about 6% of them \u2014 that substantially excluded medically necessary care, researchers are concerned that it could be the leading edge of a larger trend, said Mark Hall, a professor of law and public health at Wake Forest University, who co-authored the study.",
      "\"There's not really much in the way of regulatory guidance in what should be in or out\" of a financial assistance policy, said Christopher Goodman, a clinical assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, who has published several studies examining hospital financial assistance policies.",
      "The American Hospital Association declined to comment for this article. American Medical Association spokesperson Robert Mills said that the AMA doesn't have a position on whether all contracted physicians should be required to participate in hospital financial assistance policies.",
      "For-profit hospitals have more latitude to fashion their financial assistance policies as they wish.",
      "At HCA Healthcare, one of the country's largest for-profit health care systems, with nearly 200 hospitals in 20 states and the United Kingdom, discounted or free care is available only for \"emergent or non-elective services.\"",
      "\"Facility charity policies and uninsured discounts are typically specific to emergency services\" at HCA Healthcare, said Harlow Sumerford, an HCA Healthcare spokesperson. \"Any third-party providers are independent and would have their own financial policies.\"",
      "In recent years, several states have passed medical debt protection laws. A few apply to some doctors and other health care providers who practice at health care facilities and bill patients separately for their care.",
      "Colorado's is the most expansive. Under its Hospital Discounted Care law that first took effect in September 2022, covered hospitals have to screen all uninsured people and others who request it for eligibility for Medicaid and other health programs, and provide discounted care to people whose income is up to 250% of the federal poverty level (about $80,000 for a family of four). There are limits on how much qualifying patients can be billed each month and, after three years, their debt is retired.",
      "Under the Colorado law, licensed health care professionals who work at a covered hospital can charge qualified patients no more than the rates set by the state.",
      "\"This rule has been a game changer for folks in Colorado,\" said Melissa Duncan, consumer assistance program manager at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, which helps patients access health care and cover their bills.",
      "Unfortunately, the law didn't pass in time to help Cochran-Zipp.",
      "As hospitals grapple with the changes expected under the federal health care legislation passed this summer, discounted care programs may make a tempting target, say some health care financing experts. Facing higher rates of uncompensated care and trouble collecting payments from patients, facilities may reduce the financial assistance that they offer.",
      "Hospitals may say \"we are going to do all we can to protect our spending,\" said Ge Bai, a professor of accounting and health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University. \"In that environment, charity care will be a burden.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Sep 2025 17:48:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is targeting a visa widely used by tech companies and other employers to hire foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is adding $100,000 to the existing fee for H-1B visa applications, taking aim at a program that is used to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S.",
      "President Trump signed a proclamation late Friday adding the new visa application fee and barring H-1B workers from entering the U.S. unless they had made the $100,000 payment.",
      "\"We're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson clarified to CBS News in an email Saturday that the fee \"does not apply to anyone who has a current visa,\" and \"only applies to future applicants in the February [2026] lottery who are currently outside the U.S. It does not apply to anyone who participated in the 2025 lottery.\"",
      "\"The Proclamation does not impact the ability of any current visa holder to travel to/from the U.S.,\" Jackson said.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Saturday that the $100,000 is a one-time fee that only applies to new visas and is not an annual payment. It does not apply to renewals or current visa holders, the official said.",
      "This comes after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had told reporters Friday that the fee was \"annual.\"",
      "\"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told CBS News in a statement Saturday. \"It also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system.\"",
      "The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have\u00a0relied on the program\u00a0to hire foreign workers.",
      "The plan was\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by Bloomberg News.",
      "H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.",
      "The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.",
      "Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the\u00a0most H1-B visas\u00a0of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.",
      "\"This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,\" a White House aide said.",
      "Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.",
      "\"The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,\" Anderson told CBS News.",
      "Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.",
      "President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",
      "The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.",
      "The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March\u00a0study\u00a0from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy.",

    "summary": "Here's why groceries are costing more, and what American consumers can do to save money at the supermarket.",
    "story": [
      "Americans' grocery bills are growing, causing some shoppers to cut back on discretionary spending as they find themselves struggling to afford the basics.",
      "Food prices grew by half a percent from July to August, marking the fastest monthly rate of change since the fall of 2022. Behind the rising cost of food items on store shelves are three main culprits, according to experts.",
      "The Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, climate change and a shortage of agricultural workers in the U.S. are the leading causes of grocery inflation, Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst also known as the \"Supermarket Guru,\" told CBS News correspondent Jo Ling Kent.",
      "Price hikes, he added, have been steepest on goods that the U.S. imports from nations facing higher levies. For example, the U.S. imports about 35% of its coffee from Brazil, whose exports are taxed at a rate of 50%.",
      "The latest Consumer Price Index data shows that coffee prices rose 21% in August compared with a year ago.",
      "As companies see their costs rise, they pass along those burdens to consumers. In the case of tariffs, some businesses began raising prices on products even before the levies were in full force.",
      "\"There's no question that what we've seen is, we're seeing companies increased prices because of the impending tariffs,\" said Lempert.",
      "\"What they want to do is they want to protect themselves. A lot of these big food companies are public companies. So what they've gotta do is they've gotta report back to their shareholders on profit margins. So they've been hedging their bets,\" Lempert said.",
      "Sometimes, packaged-goods companies disguise price hikes by offering consumers less product for the same amount of money. The covert inflation strategy has been dubbed \"shrinkflation,\" Lempert explained.",
      "\"What they're doing is they're trying to put less in the package, hoping that you and I are not gonna observe that and keep that price either stable or just slightly increased,\" he said",
      "Climate change",
      "Increasing temperatures and\u00a0shifts in weather patterns have made conditions for growing some fruits and vegetables in the U.S. inhospitable. As a result, a lot of domestic production has been moved to Central and Latin America, according to Lempert.",
      "\"We can't grow our food where we used to grow it,\" he said.",
      "Labor shortage",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump's immigration policies, including raids on workplaces that employ large numbers of immigrants, plus waning interest in agricultural work, have led to an industrywide labor shortage, Lempert explained.",
      "Consumers are reacting to higher prices by looking for deals, purchasing store brand goods instead of name-brands and buying shelf-stable groceries in bulk at shopping clubs like Costco.",
      "Lempert said a little planning can go a long way to ensure that consumers can buy what they need.",
      "\"The number one thing that people want to do if they want to save money \u2014 stop wasting food,\" Lempert said.",
      "\"Forty percent of all of our food in this country is wasted. A lot of that's in our homes. So, take doggy bags from restaurants, use leftovers, freeze leftovers, don't waste food and you'll save a substantial amount of money,\" he said.",

      "President Trump signed an executive order Friday to offer up fast-track \"Gold Card\" visas to people willing to pay $1 million or more.",
      "\"The Trump Gold Card is Here,\" reads a government website, which features a mock-up of a bright, gilded card embossed with a photo of Mr. Trump, his signature and images of a bald eagle and the Statue of Liberty: \"Unlock life in America.\"",
      "Under the Gold Card program, which Mr. Trump first floated in February, non-Americans who give a gift of at least $1 million to the Commerce Department will be eligible for an \"expedited process\" to gain an immigrant visa, the executive order states. Corporations can sponsor people for Gold Cards if they give the government at least $2 million.",
      "Some 80,000 Gold Cards will be made available, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said the program is still in the \"implementation phase.\"",
      "People who are approved for a Gold Card after vetting by the State Department and Department of Homeland Security \u2014 and who pay a $15,000 \"vetting fee\" \u2014 will be considered lawful permanent residents, more commonly known as green-card holders, Lutnick told reporters Friday. He said Gold Cards will take the place of the existing EB-1 and EB-2 visa programs, which offer green cards to people with \"exceptional ability\" in business or other fields.",
      "\"You can prove exceptional value for the United States of America by contributing $1 million to the United States of America. That's a pretty good expectation that they're highly valuable,\" he said.",

      "The administration is also considering offering a $5 million \"Platinum Card\" that will allow people to spend up to 270 days in the country without paying taxes on their non-U.S. income. That program, which Lutnick said would not offer a pathway to citizenship, will need approval from Congress before it launches. The federal government has set up an online waiting list.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump signed an executive order Friday that imposes an extra $100,000 fee for people who wish to enter the U.S. on an H-1B visa, a non-immigrant visa that allows tens of thousands of people to live and work in the U.S. for up to six years.",
      "The change could mark a substantial crackdown on the H-1B program. Critics argue that the visas allow employers to undercut U.S. workers by sponsoring foreign job applicants willing to work for lower salaries. But supporters of the program argue it is essential to industries like tech that often struggle to find qualified U.S.-based workers \u2014 with firms like Amazon applying for thousands of H-1Bs per year \u2014 and employers are already required to pay H-1B recipients no less than the wages earned by similarly qualified workers.",
      "Asked Friday how he believes tech companies will react to the new H-1B fee, Mr. Trump told reporters: \"I think they're going to be very happy.\"",
      "\"And we're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases, these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,\" the president said.",

      "In a legal complaint\u00a0filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the regulatory agency also alleged that Live Nation, which owns Ticketmaster, used \"bait-and-switch pricing\" tactics by advertising lower ticket prices than what was actually available to customers, and by selling millions of tickets to brokers\u2014 often at a significant markup \u2014 despite limits that artists had placed on such sales.",
      "\"The FTC alleges that in public, Ticketmaster maintains that its business model is at odds with brokers that routinely exceed ticket limits,\" the agency said in a news release. \"But in private, Ticketmaster acknowledged that its business model and bottom line benefit from brokers preventing ordinary Americans from purchasing tickets to the shows they want to see at the prices artists set.\"",
      "The agency said Live Nation's and Ticketmaster's business practices violate the Better Online Ticket Sales Act and other laws barring deceptive sales tactics.",
      "Joining the FTC suit were attorneys general in Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia.",
      "\"It should not cost an arm and a leg to take the family to a baseball game or attend your favorite musician's show,\" FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "From 2019 to 2024, consumers spent nearly $83 billion buying tickets through Ticketmaster, the FTC said. The platform controls at least 80% of the tickets sold by major event venues, according to the agency.",
      "Live Nation, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., and Ticketmaster didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "In May, the Department of Justice filed a federal lawsuit accusing the two companies of illegally monopolizing the live entertainment industry. The suit alleged that Live Nation has violated antitrust laws in ways that hurt consumers, in part through its ownership of Ticketmaster.",
      "Live Nation bought Ticketmaster in 2009.",
      "Other ticket sellers applauded the FTC's suit against Live Nation and Ticketmaster.",
      "\"The FTC's action underscores the importance of a ticketing market built on robust competition, full pricing disclosure and the freedom to transfer tickets easily,\" Dustin Brighton, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Ticket Fairness, an advocacy group representing smaller vendors of event tickets, said in a statement. \"A healthy, competitive marketplace empowers artists and venues with more choices and fairer terms while giving fans the value and optionality they deserve, creating a ticketing ecosystem that works for everyone.\"",

      "\"We can't grow our food where we used to grow it,\" Lempert said of the impact of climate change. \"... Now it's had to move to Central and Latin America... Number two is the labor shortage... And then third is our tariffs.\"",

      "Hyundai Motor Group on Thursday confirmed it is going forward with previously announced plans to expand its Georgia plant, just weeks after an immigration raid delayed the startup of an electric vehicle battery plant at the site.",
      "As part of a broader investment strategy, Hyundai said it would spend $2.7 billion to increase production capacity at the Ellabell site by 200,000 over the next three years, to a total of 500,000 vehicles a year.",
      "The company first announced the expansion in March at the grand opening of the plant west of Savannah, and had said in August that it would invest an additional $5 billion in the United States overall. But the raid, which included arrests of more than 300 South Korean citizens, led to questions about the wisdom of the Asian nation investing in the U.S.",
      "The company said it now plans to produce 10 models of electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles in Georgia, up from the current two the plant has been assembling as it ramps up production. Hyundai says it's still on track to expand production worldwide to 5.6 million vehicles a year by 2030. The automaker pledged that 60% of those vehicles will be electric or hybrid powered, targeting sales in South Korea, North America and Europe.",
      "Hyundai said that it plans to make more than 80% of vehicles sold in the United States domestically by 2030, with total domestic content increasing from 60% to 80%. For the first time, the vehicles would include a mid-sized pickup truck, a key vehicle class in the U.S. market. The company already makes the Santa Cruz model, a four-door compact pickup, that it started selling in 2021.",
      "Hyundai CEO Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz has said the immigration raid will delay opening\u00a0the battery plant by at least two to three months. Spokesperson Michael Stewart said Thursday that the facility will open in the first half of 2026.",
      "Both Hyundai executives and Georgia officials have been trying to calm the situation since the raid, which mushroomed into a diplomatic dispute between South Korea and the United States.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters Tuesday at a ceremony marking the groundbreaking of a Rivian Automotive electric vehicle plant that he remains confident Georgia's business advantages would \"win out\" in terms of foreign investment. The raid may even wind up smoothing the way for South Korean employees to more easily obtain legal permission to help build and operate facilities in the United States, he said.",
      "\"I've had good conversations with companies that are here doing business in Georgia, companies that are looking to do business here,\" Kemp said. \"And I've had good conversations with people in the White House about the visa issue.\"",
      "Brent Stubbs, the chief administrative officer of the Ellabell site, wrote in an opinion piece published Wednesday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the company is still committed to Georgia.",
      "\"This situation doesn't change our plans to continue expanding and localizing in the United States,\" Stubbs wrote. \"Our investments in America are part of a long-term strategic plan.\"",
      "The $2.7 billion investment confirmed Thursday will go to expanding capacity at the plant and group affiliates, Stewart said. Hyundai and its onsite affiliates currently have 3,129 employees in Ellabell, he said.",
      "Hyundai and its joint-venture partner in the battery plant, LG Energy Solution, had previously announced $12.6 billion of investments at the Georgia site, with pledges to hire at least 8,500 workers by the end of 2031. State and local governments have promised $2.1 billion in tax breaks and other incentives.",
      "The boost at the Ellabell site is the biggest part Hyundai's plan to raise production by 1.2 million vehicles a year worldwide. That includes another 250,000 vehicles out of Pune, India; and 200,000 more at Hyundai's electric vehicle plant in Ulsan, South Korea. The automaker said it would also deliver parts for assembly into an additional 250,000 vehicles at plants in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and North Africa.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-september-2025-rates-loans-mortgages/",
    "published": "Thu, 18 Sep 2025 13:27:19 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut since December could be followed by more reductions later in 2025. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday delivered its first rate cut since December, a move that will ripple through everything from home loans to credit cards, although not all Americans will notice the change in the same way.",
      "The Fed cut reduces its federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one-quarter point, shaving its target range to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "Though incremental, the policy turn is significant. Fed officials foresee two additional cuts in 2025 and one more in 2026, a trajectory that could lower rates by a full percentage point and lighten the load for millions of borrowers. For now, the quarter-point reduction will trickle through unevenly: some borrowers will see relief almost immediately, while others may notice little change, depending on their rates and the products they hold, according to experts.",
      "\"Any reduction is welcome, and especially if this is the first of several to come, which it sounds like it might be,\"Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, said in a statement. \"That's a positive thing.\"",
      "One area where Schulz doesn't expect consumers to see significant change is on credit card rates. While banks will lower their annual percentage rates in response to the cut, it's probably not going to make much of a dent for people who carry a balance, given that the average APR currently stands at about 20%.",
      "\"That quarter point isn't going to make that much of a difference,\" Schulz said.",
      "Here's where you're most likely to feel an immediate impact from the Fed's reduction \u2014 for better and worse.",
      "Home equity line of credit",
      "A home equity line of credit (HELOC) represents one of the financial products where the Fed rate cut could provide a bigger bang for borrowers' bucks.",
      "A HELOC is a line of credit based on the value of your home. In some ways, it is similar to a credit card, because it provides a maximum credit line that borrowers can draw down and their interest rates are variable \u2014 which means they rise and fall based on the prime rate, which in turn is influenced by the fed funds rate.",
      "If you have a HELOC, you can expect your rate to decline by one-quarter point within a month or two, according to Bankrate. The average HELOC today has a rate of about 8.05%, the financial site notes.",
      "\"HELOCs are one of the types of loans that tend to be directly impacted, so if you do have a HELOC, that quarter-point reduction can be pretty significant,\" Schulz said.",
      "According to CBS News' Managing Your Money, that 0.25 percentage-point reduction could trim a borrowers' costs on a $100,000 HELOC by about $173 annually. Bigger savings could be in store if the Fed carries through with additional rate cuts later this year and in early 2026.",
      "Mortgages",
      "House hunters enjoyed a preemptive benefit from the Fed rate cut, as mortgage rates have declined this month in anticipation of lower rates.",
      "Average rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.35%\u00a0this week, its lowest level in nearly a year. Just two years ago, mortgages approached 8%, hitting their\u00a0highest levels since 2000.",
      "Mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, but they're heavily influenced by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "\"It's not just about what the Fed is doing today, it's about what they're expected to do in the future, and that's determined by things like economic growth, what's going to happen in the labor market and what do we think inflation is going to be like over the next year or so,\" Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told AP News.",
      "While additional rate cuts later this year aren't guaranteed to result in lower home loan rates, it's a possibility, said Stephen Kates, financial analyst at Bankrate.",
      "\"It means that they probably could go down more, and they may trend in that direction, even if they don't move in lockstep,\" he added.",
      "High-interest savings accounts",
      "Unfortunately, the Fed's rate cut could have a negative impact on one group: Savers.",
      "Since the Fed started hiking rates in 2022 to battle soaring inflation, high-interest savings accounts and certificates of deposit have been the silver lining for consumers. People who had money to sock away in one of those accounts or a CD could get rates as high as 5% in 2024.",
      "Currently, savers can still find high-interest savings accounts offering 4%, but those might drop soon as banks adjust their offers to reflect the Fed's rate reduction, Schulz said.",
      "\"Expect yields on high-interest savings accounts and CDs to drop. Savers may want to act now by locking in today's still-high rates before they fall further,\" he noted.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to allow President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "In its request for emergency relief from the high court, the Justice Department said that the justices should freeze a lower court decision that ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled earlier this week that Cook could remain\u00a0in her role while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "Mr. Trump's emergency appeal to the high court comes after Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's committee that sets interest rates this week. The central bank on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, its first cut since December. The president has repeatedly criticized the Fed for moving too slowly to lower interest rates.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the request to the Supreme Court. \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "Lisa Cook's firing",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook last month over allegations she made misrepresentations on mortgage filings. She has not been charged with any crime and denies wrongdoing. Cook's removal by Mr. Trump was unprecedented \u2014 no president has attempted to remove a Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics warned that it threatened the independence of the Fed.",
      "Cook swiftly filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing her removal violated the Federal Reserve Act. The law specifies that a president can only remove a governor \"for cause.\" Cook also argued her due process rights were violated because she was not provided notice of the allegations against her and a meaningful opportunity to respond.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with Cook earlier this month, finding that her firing likely violated the Federal Reserve Act and her right to due process under the Fifth Amendment. She ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The Trump administration sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which left Cobb's order intact. Judge Bradley Garcia wrote in a concurring opinion that Cook is likely to succeed in her claim that Mr. Trump's attempt to terminate her violated her due process rights. But he wrote that the court did not need to address the meaning of \"for cause\" at this stage in the case.",
      "The White House had said the administration would seek the Supreme Court's intervention, as it has done in several other legal challenges to Mr. Trump's efforts to remove Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies. The high court has so far allowed the president to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, but it acknowledged in May that the Fed is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "In his filing, Sauer argued that Cook received adequate notice and opportunity to contest her removal.",
      "\"The President notified Cook of the charges against her and waited five days for her to respond before removing her,\" he wrote. \"Having declined to bring any defense to the President's attention or to dispute any material facts, Cook cannot complain about insufficient process.\"",
      "The solicitor general noted that the administration is not contesting the constitutionality of the for-cause removal protection for members of the Fed Board, but instead believes the president's firing of Cook complies with it. Still, Sauer said the district court's finding that conduct that occurred before Cook was appointed to the Fed does not constitute \"cause\" under the Federal Reserve Act\u00a0 was \"flawed.\"",
      "\"The President's strong concerns about the appearance of mortgage fraud, based on facially contradictory representations made to obtain mortgages by someone whose job is to set interest rates that affect Americans' mortgages, satisfies any conception of cause,\" he wrote. \"That is especially true here, where Cook has not disputed any material fact or offered any plausible justification for her conduct.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he was\u00a0firing Cook, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, from the Fed Board of Governors and had \"sufficient cause\" to oust her. Cook's 14-year-term on the Fed is set to end in January 2038.",
      "The president cited as grounds for her removal claims made by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook made false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "Pulte alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that Cook claimed two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence on mortgage documents from 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Pulte, who was appointed to lead the FHFA by Mr. Trump, has continued to make accusations against Cook related to mortgage documents.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud.\" Documents obtained by The Associated Press this week showed that Cook referred to the property as a \"vacation home\" in a loan estimate, potentially undercutting the Trump administration's claims of fraud.",

      "Nvidia, the world's leading chipmaker, announced on Thursday that it's investing $5 billion in Intel and will collaborate with the struggling semiconductor company.",
      "The two companies will team up to work on custom data centers that form the backbone of artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as personal computer products, Nvidia said in a press release.",
      "Nvidia said it will spend $5 billion to buy Intel common stock at $23.28 a share. The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, comes a month after the U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel.",
      "\"This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem \u2014 a fusion of two world-class platforms,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. \"Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.\"",
      "The two companies said they will work on \"seamlessly connecting\" their architectures.",
      "In morning trading, Intel shares jumped 25%, its biggest one-day percentage gain in decades. Nvidia shares added 2%.",
      "For data centers, Intel will make custom chips that Nvidia will use in its AI infrastructure platforms. While for PC products, Intel will build chips that integrate Nvidia technology.",
      "The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, which was a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel fell even farther behind in recent years amid the artificial intelligence boom that's propelled Nvidia into the world's most valuable company. Intel lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, and expects to slash its workforce by a quarter by the end of 2025.",
      "The U.S. government stepped in last month to secure a 10% stake, making it one of Intel's biggest shareholders. Federal officials said they invested in Intel in order to bolster U.S. technology and domestic manufacturing.",
      "The deal is \"bullish for U.S. tech,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note.",
      "\"This is a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game,\" Ives said. \"Along with the recent U.S. government investment for 10% (equity stake in Intel) this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors.\"",
      "Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the artificial intelligence boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems.",
      "The deal between the two chipmakers comes as China moves to be less dependent on U.S. semiconductor technology. This week, Chinese officials reportedly forbade several large domestic technology companies from purchasing Nvidia chips, and Huawei announced that it was expanding its development of AI chips and manufacturing.",
      "While Nvidia and Intel will work together to develop new chips, a manufacturing deal has yet to be struck between the two. The potential access to Intel's chip foundries by Nvidia poses a risk to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which currently manufactures the tech giant's flagship processors.",

      "Starbucks workers in three states took legal action against the coffee giant Wednesday, saying it violated the law when it changed its dress code but refused to reimburse employees who had to buy new clothes.",
      "The employees, who are backed by the union organizing Starbucks' workers, filed class-action lawsuits in state court in Illinois and Colorado. Workers also filed complaints with California's Labor and Workforce Development Agency. If the agency decides not to seek penalties against Starbucks, the workers intend to file a class-action lawsuit in California, according to the complaints.",
      "Starbucks didn't comment directly on them Wednesday, but the company said it simplified its dress code to deliver a more consistent experience to customers and give its employees clearer guidance.",
      "\"As part of this change, and to ensure out partners were prepared, partners received two shirts at no cost,\" the company said Wednesday. Starbucks refers to its employees as \"partners.\"",
      "The dress code sparked a strike at 75 U.S. stores in May soon after it went into effect, with more than 1,000 workers protesting the new policy, according to Starbucks Workers United, which represents workers at 640 of Starbucks' 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores. The union said the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining but isn't a party to the suits.",
      "The new dress code requires all workers in North America to wear a solid black shirt with short or long sleeves under their green aprons. Shirts may or may not have collars, but they must cover the midriff and armpits.",
      "Employees must wear khaki, black or blue denim bottoms without patterns or frayed hems or solid black dresses that are not more than 4 inches above the knee. The dress code also requires workers to wear black, gray, dark blue, brown, tan or white shoes made from a waterproof material. Socks and hosiery must be \"subdued,\" the company said.",
      "The dress code prohibits employees from having face tattoos or more than one facial piercing. Tongue piercings and \"theatrical makeup\" are also prohibited.",
      "Starbucks said in April that the new dress code would make employees' green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers. It comes as the company is trying to reestablish a warmer, more welcoming experience in its stores.",
      "Before the new dress code was imposed, Starbucks had a relatively lax policy. In 2016, it began allowing employees to wear patterned shirts in a wider variety of colors to give them more opportunities for self-expression.",
      "The old dress code was also loosely enforced, according to the Colorado lawsuit. But under the new dress code, employees who don't comply aren't allowed to start their shifts.",
      "Brooke Allen, a full-time student who also works at a Starbucks in Davis, California, said she was told by a manager in July that the Crocs she was wearing didn't meet the new standards and she would have to wear different shoes if she wanted to work the following day. Allen had to go to three stores to find a compliant pair, which cost her $60.09.",
      "Allen has spent an additional $86.95 on clothes for work, including black shirts and jeans.",
      "\"I think it's extremely tone deaf on the company's part to expect their employees to completely redesign their wardrobe without any compensation,\" Allen said. \"A lot of us are already living paycheck to paycheck.\"",
      "Allen said she misses the old dress code, which allowed her to express herself with colorful shirts and three facial piercings.",
      "\"It looks sad now that everyone is wearing black,\" she said.",
      "The lawsuits and complaints filed Wednesday allege that Starbucks' dress code violates state laws that require companies to reimburse workers for expenses that primarily benefit the employer. Colorado law also prohibits employers from imposing expenses on workers without their written consent, according to that lawsuit. The plaintiffs seek damages on behalf of all Starbucks workers in those states, whether or not their stores are unionized.",
      "Multiple plaintiffs, like Allen, said they requested reimbursement from Starbucks to conform to the dress code but were denied. Gilbert Cruz, an employee in Aurora, Illinois, requested $10 for the cost of removing a nose piercing.",

In 2025, homeowners insurance costs rose have risen most sharply in California, where premiums in Los Angeles were up 19.5% compared to a year ago, according to the loan analytics firm.",
      "Soaring homeowners insurance rates are leading some Americans to switch insurers, or do without coverage altogether \u2014 a risky step that can prove financially ruinous and that experts strongly discourage.",
      "\"All things being equal, if you raise prices customers aren't happy,\" J.D. Power managing director Craig Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"As premiums increase, it starts to impact how people perceive insurance, and they start to wonder if their insurer cares about them or their profits.\"",
      "Property insurance premiums vary by geography, and are typically higher in places where residents are more vulnerable to disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires that scientists link to climate change, according to insurance experts.",
      "\"The price of insurance is increasing as the level of risk increases,\" said Sean Kevelighan, CEO of the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group that provides information to consumers. \"We are beginning to see some trends of Americans making tougher decisions about their insurance.\"",
      "According to a recent Realtor.com survey of homeowners, nearly 60% of respondents said they might forgo purchasing property coverage if it becomes too expensive.",
      "\"Households are feeling squeezed, and more are considering going without home insurance altogether,\" Realtor.com economic data analyst Hannah Jones told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What's behind rising premiums?",
      "Several factors have led to the surge in property insurance costs:\u00a0higher home values, mounting climate-related risks, and the higher cost of lumber, steel and other building materials, insurance experts said. In June, the median home sale price in the U.S. hit a record high of nearly $400,000, according to online real estate firm Redfin.",
      "\"We've seen costs related to construction materials rise, and the price of insurance is a reflection of risk, plus the cost to pay a claim,\" Kevelighan said.",
      "\"It's a double whammy,\" Jones added. \"If your home is worth more, it costs more to insure, and also your home is more at risk, so you stand to lose more if you go without insurance.\"",
      "\"We don't recommend going without insurance because it leaves you extremely exposed in case you do suffer property damage, or a complete loss of property,\" she said.",
      "However, homeowners do have alternatives when it comes to choosing an insurer, while there are steps they can take to try to minimize their coverage costs.",
      "\"A few of these things are under people's control,\" NerdWallet homeowners insurance expert Holden Lewis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you are in a place where there are a lot of wildfires, you can change your landscaping so you don't have flammable materials, for example.\"",

    "story": [
      "Americans could get some financial relief next year when the IRS adjusts its federal income tax brackets for inflation, a change that could help lower taxes for millions of households.",
      "Each fall \u2014 typically in October or November \u2014 the IRS announces inflation adjustments that affects everything from the tax brackets people are subject to based on their income to the size of the standard deduction. Some experts are already projecting those changes by analyzing the same inflation data the tax agency uses as part its annual reset.",
      "Based on that analysis, the IRS is likely to apply an inflation rate of 2.7% in adjusting its brackets and other items, according to Bloomberg Tax. It based its projection on chained Consumer Price Index data for the past 12 months.",
      "Separately, the bottom two tax brackets will see a bigger adjustment next year because of the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which applies a more generous inflation bump for those bands. Those brackets will see a roughly 4% increase in their income thresholds next year, Bloomberg Tax calculated.",
      "The IRS tweaks those thresholds to avoid so-called \"bracket creep,\" which can occur if the bands fail to keep up with inflation. Without those annual adjustments, workers who get a cost-of-living pay increase could be pushed into a higher tax bracket even though their standard of living hasn't changed.",
      "\"If they didn't do it year after year, for example with the standard deduction, it would become less and less meaningful each year for taxpayers,\" Amber Gorski, an analyst at Bloomberg Tax and Accounting, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In other words, you'll have to earn more income next year to reach each higher band of taxation. For instance, a single taxpayer who earns $50,000 in 2025 would have a top tax rate of 22%, but in 2026 their highest marginal rate would be 12%, according to Bloomberg's projections.",
      "How the adjustments could impact you",
      "Some Americans could see a tax break due to the higher thresholds for each bracket.",
      "\"Going into 2026, they could use that information to estimate what their tax return potentially is going to be, and what they might owe in taxes,\" Gorski said.",
      "On top of the higher income thresholds for 2026, some seniors and workers could also benefit from changes implemented under the \"big, beautiful\" bill. Those include an extra $6,000 senior deduction and the elimination of some taxes on tipped income and overtime pay for qualifying workers.",
      "The passage of the tax and spending bill in July ensures that next year's tax bracket rates will remain the same. That means the individual tax rates will remain at 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%, although the thresholds for each band will edge higher because of the inflation adjustments.",
      "Without the new tax law, enacted \u00a0by President Trump in July, the bracket rates would have reverted to their levels before the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Prior to that law, for instance, the highest individual income bracket stood at 39.6%.",
      "The IRS has based its annual inflation adjustments on the so-called\u00a0\"chained Consumer Price Index,\"\u00a0as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Bloomberg notes that some of its projections could vary slightly from the IRS' official announcement, which typically arrives in October.",
      "\"The IRS will issue authoritative guidance, as it usually does, sometime between mid-October and early November,\" an IRS spokesman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "How tax brackets work",
      "There's a common misconception that your top tax rate is what you pay on the entire amount of your annual income, but that's incorrect. Each bracket represents the percentage you'll pay in taxes on each slice of income within that band.",
      "Take the example of the worker who earns $50,000 per year. In 2026, that taxpayer would pay 10% on the first $12,400 of earned income, and then 12% on any income above $12,401 and up to $50,400.",

    "summary": "President Trump is following through on his vow to designate antifa as a terrorist group \u2014 but the move's legal impact is unclear.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed an executive order Monday labeling antifa a \"domestic terrorist organization\" \u2014 though the move's legal impact is unclear.",
      "The executive order directs Trump administration officials to investigate and thwart \"any and all illegal operations\" allegedly carried out by antifa members, and to pursue people who \"fund such operations\" or provide material support to them.",
      "The president promised to designate antifa as a \"major terrorist organization\" last week in the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, although officials have not said there was a link between his killing and any left-wing groups.",
      "It's not clear what happens next. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, typically refers to a loose affiliation of mostly left-wing activists, and isn't generally considered to be an organized group with a clear leadership structure. And the U.S. doesn't have a statute that gives the president the power to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations or charge people with domestic terrorism, legal experts told CBS News last week.",
      "In a fact sheet, the White House argued antifa \"has a long history of terrorizing our communities.\" It listed out several attacks on or threats against law enforcement agencies and pro-Trump events in recent years, some of which were allegedly carried out by people who self-identified with antifa.",
      "The White House also cited Kirk's assassination as an example of a \"trend of Radical Left violence.\" Authorities say Kirk's suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, had become \"more political\" in recent years and lashed out against Kirk's \"hatred\" in text messages, though they have not released evidence tying Robinson to antifa.",
      "In 2020, the Congressional Research Service called antifa a \"decentralized\" movement made up of \"independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals\" who typically believe in socialism, communism and anarchism. It said followers of antifa lack a singular organizational structure, set of ideological views or common list of enemies.",
      "University of Pittsburgh professor Michael Kenney told CBS News last week there is \"no single organization called antifa,\" adding: \"There's tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.\"",
      "The antifa movement's roots date back to opponents of neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan in the 1980s, and an Oregon-based group became the first organization to use the term \"antifa\" in its name in 2007, according to the Congressional Research Service. The group gained more attention a decade later, during the clashes between far-right groups and their opponents in Charlottesville, Virginia, early in Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Mr. Trump and his appointees first vowed to crack down on antifa in his first term, with the president calling for antifa to be designated a terrorist group in 2020. He did not follow through on that threat.",
      "In 2017, then-FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress the agency was carrying out \"anarchist extremist investigations\" against suspects \"who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology,\" CRS notes. Three years later, Wray described antifa as a \"movement or an ideology,\" not a singular group.",
      "Mr. Trump's latest push could face legal hurdles. Unlike with foreign terrorist organizations, there isn't a legal mechanism for the president to designate a domestic terrorist group, Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, told CBS News last week. But the administration could choose to make antifa-related incidents a higher priority for federal law enforcement, he noted.",
      "Domestic terrorism also is not a chargeable offense under federal law, though most states have a domestic terrorism statute, and other federal criminal statutes could be applied to alleged domestic terrorists.",
      "\"You can't prosecute an ideology,\" Baumgartner said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-autism-tylenol-medical-experts/",
    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 20:03:09 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration announced it believes acetaminophen is linked to autism risk, but the maker of Tylenol and medical experts have strongly pushed back on the claims.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced the Food and Drug Administration believes the use of acetaminophen \u2014 the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications \u2014 during pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of autism, though medical experts have said the medication is safe.",
      "\"Effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,\" the president said.\"So, taking Tylenol is not good, alright? I'll say it. It's not good. For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary.\"",
      "\"Ideally, a woman won't take Tylenol,\" he said, and pivoted to discussion of childhood vaccination, saying vaccines should be given in \"smaller doses\" and spread out \"over a period of years,\" without citing medical evidence for his claims about vaccines. On his various vaccine recommendations, the president said, \"You know, I'm just making these statements from me, I'm not making them from these doctors.\"",
      "Kennedy said the FDA based its decision on acetaminophen on \"clinical and laboratory studies,\" that \"suggest a potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes,\" including one study in the public health journal Environmental Health, but added that \"NIH research teams are currently testing multiple hypotheses.\"",
      "However, in a major study published last year, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",
      "After Mr. Trump's announcement, the FDA shared an open letter encouraging physicians to \"consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers\" \u2014 though the agency was more cautious than some of the president's statements.",
      "\"To be clear, while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature,\" the letter states, calling the issue an \"ongoing area of scientific debate.\"",
      "The letter also stated physicians should balance the possible risks of acetaminophen with the fact that it is still safer than other over-the-counter painkillers and fever-reducing drugs during pregnancy, like aspirin and ibuprofen.",
      "The announcement comes after Kennedy said in April that HHS would undertake a \"massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism. Kennedy at the time said the plan was to release a comprehensive report in September. However, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said later that month it could be as long as a year before the findings are released.",
      "\"To meet the president's challenge, I ordered HHS to launch unprecedented, all-agency effort to identify all causes of autism, including toxic and pharmaceutical exposures,\" Kennedy said.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary also announced FDA approval of the drug leucovorin to treat autism in children. It has previously been used off-label for that purpose.",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why. Most experts say it is likely due to a combination of factors, including changes in the way the condition is diagnosed.",
      "Tylenol maker responds to autism claims",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said \"independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism.\"",
      "\"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise,\" the statement continues, highlighting what the company says is the greater health risk for expecting mothers from other conditions if they give up on taking the drug. \"Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.\"",
      "\"The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism,\" the company said, adding that it \"will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.\"",
      "Medical experts on acetaminophen and autism research",
      "In a statement to CBS News when reports of the administration's plans first surfaced, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said, \"There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"",
      "\"The best evidence does not show an association between Tylenol and autism,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. \"The medical community, the scientific community has the same consensus, which is that Tylenol, acetaminophen, is safe in pregnancy.\"",
      "Gounder said acetaminophen is considered the safest option for treating issues like pain and high fever during pregnancy.",
      "\"If you have a high fever during pregnancy, that can cause neurodevelopment issues in the baby, so you don't want to let that fever go untreated,\" Gounder explained, adding she's worried that expectant mothers may turn to other options that would be less safe.",
      "\"Will women end up taking other medications like aspirin or ibuprofen during pregnancy? Those actually can be dangerous, especially in the third trimester, you can end up with kidney issues, cardiac issues in the baby,\" she said.",
      "While some previous research suggested there could be a possible association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, those studies involved relatively small groups and did not prove a link. Larger and more robust studies have found no connection.",
      "\"Any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science and is premature given the current science,\" the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, \"Safety is the top priority for manufacturers,\" and \"the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use.\"",
      "\"Scientific and medical authorities around the world recognize acetaminophen as the only analgesic considered safe for use during pregnancy when used according to the Drug Facts label, which specifically reminds pregnant women to always consult their healthcare provider before use,\" the group said.",
      "What is leucovorin?",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said autism \"may also be due to an autoimmune reaction to a folate receptor on the brain not allowing that important vitamin to get into the brain cells.\"",
      "He announced FDA approval of the drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid (also known as folate or vitamin B9), to treat autism in children. Leucovorin is an inexpensive, generic drug that was previously approved to ease the side effects of cancer chemotherapy.",
      "Pregnant women are prescribed multivitamins with folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. The neural tube develops into the brain and spinal cord.",
      "Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"You can have a perfectly normal folate level in your blood, but it may not be getting into the brain, and so there's a defect in the transport of folate into the brain. Leucovorin works around that,\" Gounder explained. \"Not all children with autism have this defect, so there's a test you can do to assess whether that's what's at play. For those kids, leucovorin has been shown to help, particularly with speech, getting kids to be more verbal than they were before.\"",
      "Leucovorin isn't a cure for autism, but \"it could really have a substantial impact on a very good percentage of children with autism,\" Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, told CBS News earlier this year.",

      "The meeting's time and location have not been determined, according to one of the sources, a White House official.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats, have repeatedly asked Republican leaders to negotiate with them on a short-term funding patch. In a letter to Mr. Trump this past weekend, Schumer and Jeffries demanded a meeting with the president and said Democrats would not support a \"dirty spending bill\" that does not address their health care priorities.",
      "\"Republicans will bear responsibility for another painful government shutdown because of the refusal of GOP congressional leadership to even talk with Democrats,\" the letter said. \"As a result, it is now your obligation to meet with us directly to reach an agreement to keep the government open and address the Republican healthcare crisis.\"",
      "Competing proposals to keep the government funded past the Sept. 30 deadline failed in the Senate on Friday. The Republican measure would fund the government until Nov. 21, and provide an $88 million boost in security funding for lawmakers, Supreme Court justices and the executive branch. The Democratic proposal would keep it open until Oct. 31 and included security funding, health care priorities and other provisions that would roll back Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "Republicans argued Democrats have no reason to oppose their bill because it does not include any controversial provisions.",
      "The Republican bill narrowly cleared the House earlier Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump on Friday told reporters that the there could be a shutdown amid the impasse.",
      "\"We'll continue to talk to the Democrats, but I think you could very well end up with a closed country for a period of time,\" he said.",
      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump said, \"I'd love to meet with them, but I don't think it's going to have any impact.\"",
      "After votes Friday, the House and Senate left Washington for at least a week. Both chambers were originally scheduled to be in recess until Sept. 29, but House leaders extended their break past the Oct. 1 deadline to pressure the Senate to adopt their bill.

Station owners Nexstar -- which needs the FCC to approve a deal to purchase rival Tegna -- and Sinclair both said they'd pull the show indefinitely before ABC followed suit.",

    "summary": "President Trump moved to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her position as a member of the Federal Trade Commission in March.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will decide whether President Trump can fire members of the Federal Trade Commission without cause, taking up a dispute that tests the president's removal power and could weaken protections enacted by Congress that aim to insulate independent agencies from political pressure.",
      "The high court said in a brief order that it will also allow Mr. Trump to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her position at the FTC while it considers the case. It will hear arguments in its December session, and its stay will remain in place until it issues a decision. Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the majority's decision to allow Slaughter's removal.",
      "The justices will consider whether removal protections for members of the FTC violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether its 1935 decision that allowed Congress to impose removal protections for officials at independent agencies should be overturned. It will also weigh whether a federal court can prevent a person's removal from public office, as U.S. district courts have been doing in challenges stemming from Mr. Trump's firings of Democratic appointees.",
      "In her dissent, Kagan wrote that the Supreme Court has \"handed full control\" of certain independent agencies that Congress has sought to shield from political pressure to the president.",
      "\"He may now remove \u2014 so says the majority, though Congress said differently \u2014 any member he wishes, for any reason or no reason at all. And he may thereby extinguish the agencies' bipartisanship and independence,\" she said.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi cheered the Supreme Court's decision as a \"significant\" victory that she said protects the president's executive authority.",
      "\"This helps affirm our argument that the President, not a lower court judge, has hiring and firing power over executive officials,\" Bondi wrote on social media. \"We will continue fighting and winning in court to defend President Trump's agenda.\"",
      "The dispute arose out of Mr. Trump's move to oust Slaughter from her position on the FTC. A lower court found that the president's attempt to fire Slaughter violated a 1914 law that limits the grounds for removing an FTC commissioner to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, and ordered her to be reinstated. Earlier this month, Chief Justice John Roberts had\u00a0temporarily paused that lower court order blocking Slaughter's firing while the Supreme Court considered whether to grant the Trump administration emergency relief.",
      "In its emergency appeal to the high court, the Trump administration urged the justices to swiftly evaluate the constitutionality of the removal restrictions for the FTC before the appeals court has weighed in. Lawyers for Slaughter agreed that the question of whether the protections violate the separation of powers is ripe for the Supreme Court's consideration.",
      "The case is the latest in a string of emergency appeals that arrived before the Supreme Court in response to Mr. Trump's efforts to fire Democratic-appointed members of independent agencies at will. The conservative justices have endorsed the president's removal authority so far, clearing the way for Mr. Trump to fire without cause members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission despite federal laws protecting them from being removed at will.",
      "Those decisions have called into question the future of the 90-year-old precedent that upheld removal protections enacted by Congress for members of the FTC, the same body on which Slaughter served. In its 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the Supreme Court said Congress could shield certain officials from being removed by the president without cause.",
      "Lower courts have relied on Humphrey's Executor as grounds for reinstating officials whom Mr. Trump has attempted to fire. But the steady stream of those decisions prompted calls for the Supreme Court to definitively decide whether the president has the authority to fire the leaders of independent agencies that Congress has insulated from political shifts.",
      "In a concurring opinion in a case involving the removal of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Committee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh warned that \"the downsides of delay in definitively resolving the status of the precedent sometimes tend to outweigh the benefits of further lower-court consideration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump appointed Slaughter to the FTC in 2018, and former President Joe Biden reappointed her to a second term expiring in 2029.",
      "But in March, Mr. Trump moved to oust Slaughter from her position at the FTC. Slaughter, however, sued, arguing that her firing was illegal because federal law limits a commissioner's removal to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "Lower courts ruled in Slaughter's favor and ordered her to be reinstated to her position. The Trump administration then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "In court filings, lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the modern FTC exercises \"vast executive authority,\" a change from the 1935-era commission. The Supreme Court in Humphrey's Executor said Congress could insulate members of independent agencies from being removed without cause if that entity met certain criteria, including performing only quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the FTC wields \"substantial executive authority,\" like the other agencies whose members the president has been allowed to remove.",
      "\"[D]istrict courts cannot compel reinstatement of agency heads and allow them to purport to exercise executive power when the President has determined they should exercise none,\" he wrote.",
      "But lawyers for Slaughter said that for the past 90 years, every president, including Mr. Trump during his first term, has respected the Supreme Court's finding that the for-cause removal requirement for the FTC is valid under the Constitution.",
      "\"The protracted and unanimous acquiescence of all three branches of government in the law at issue here \u2014 a law that affirmatively empowers the President to remove commissioners for good cause \u2014 defeats Applicants' assertion that their continued adherence to that still-binding precedent while their appeal is pending would cause them irreparable harm,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "Slaughter's legal team warned that if she could be fired by the president without cause, the FTC would be \"severely wounded and radically transformed.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's 90-year-old precedent provided a narrow exception to the president's removal authority. But the high court has in recent years chipped away at that ruling.",
      "In 2020, the Supreme Court found that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance, was unconstitutional. Then, the following year, it ruled that the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Agency violates the separation of powers because it is led by a single director who could be removed by the president only for cause.",

Her temporary appointment comes days after Erik Siebert, who had been serving as the top prosecutor in the office, resigned amid concerns he would be forced out for failing to prosecute New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged mortgage fraud. The president said he fired Siebert.",
      "Federal law allows Halligan to serve as interim U.S. attorney for only 120 days, unless federal judges on the U.S. district court in the region extend her appointment or she is confirmed by the Senate. The district court in the Eastern District of Virginia is known as the \"rocket docket\" because of how quickly cases move from filing to trial. It handles significant national security cases in part due to its proximity to Washington, D.C.",
      "In her role in the second Trump administration, Halligan was part of an effort by the White House to remove \"improper ideology\" from the Smithsonian Institution and its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.",

      "Before joining the White House and working for Mr. Trump, Halligan handled insurance claims at a law firm in Florida. She graduated from the University of Miami Law School in 2013 and was admitted to the Florida Bar in 2014. Halligan has never worked in a prosecutor's office. A legal marketing website with Halligan's resume, USattorneys.com, says that she interned at the Miami Public Defender's Office and the Innocence Project.",

      "The turmoil among the top ranks of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Virginia came after Siebert, who served as the top prosecutor since January, told staff Friday he had resigned. Multiple sources told CBS News that federal prosecutors were concerned Siebert could be removed for failing to prosecute James for mortgage fraud.",
      "The federal judges in the Eastern District of Virginia had agreed in May to extend Siebert's appointment.",
      "But Mr. Trump had expressed his displeasure with Siebert, saying Friday, \"I want him out.\" The president had nominated Siebert in May to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, and his nomination was awaiting a vote by the full Senate.",
      "The president criticized Siebert because he had the support of Virginia's two Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner. A U.S. attorney nominee requires the backing of the two senators who represent the state to advance through the Senate Judiciary Committee. It seems unlikely Kaine and Warner would support Halligan's nomination.",
      "Over the weekend, a conservative lawyer, Margaret \"Maggie\" Cleary, separately told staff in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia that she had been named its top prosecutor in an acting capacity. CBS News has reached out to the White House and Justice Department for clarification.",
      "As of midday Monday, both Cleary's name and Siebert's name had appeared on separate court filings.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tiktok-ownership-structure-announcement-details-china/",
    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 16:06:28 -0400",
    "summary": "\"We feel confident that China has approved the deal,\" a senior White House official told reporters.",
    "story": [
      "The White House on Monday announced basic details of a plan it says will \"save\" TikTok for the social media app's 170 million U.S. users through a new ownership deal, although China has suggested a deal has yet to be finalized.",
      "The structure would move TikTok U.S. operations into a new \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, a senior White House official told reporters on the condition of anonymity. Software maker Oracle would serve as the security provider for U.S. operations, the senior White House official said, providing \"top to bottom\" security, including security of the algorithm. Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman & CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "The structure brings the algorithm \"under control of the U.S. joint venture,\" the official said.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, right, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the official said.",
      "The official anticipated the president will sign an executive order later this week declaring the terms of the deal meet America's national security interests, and extend the enforcement pause on the law banning TikTok for an additional 120 days.",
      "Congress has effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. based on national security concerns, telling TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest or face a ban in the U.S., but Mr. Trump has paused its enforcement three times. Congress may still need to sign off on any finalized TikTok deal.",
      "A possible sticking point in the plan to transfer TikTok's ownership to U.S. parties is the question of who would control TikTok's algorithm, the complex and powerful software code that has driven the app's rapid growth around the world. Some policy experts think allowing ByteDance personnel to retain access to all or part of the algorithm could expose U.S. users of the platform to risk.",
      "It's not clear if any Chinese officials would be allowed on the board of directors, and investors are still being sought. The official said there has been \"an overwhelming interest in this project\" from \"household\" names that Americans would recognize. Over the weekend, the president indicated media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan would likely be involved somehow.",
      "But Beijing has yet to publicly acknowledge a deal has been reached or a framework has been agreed upon. Last week, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Beijing would \"support their teams in reaching a proper deal on TikTok through consultation.\" And on Friday, the president said he had \"made progress\" on a TikTok deal during a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The senior White House official said they don't have plans for additional talks with the Chinese delegation on behalf of the U.S. government.",
      "\"We feel confident that China has approved the deal,\" the senior White House official said.",
      "The president told reporters last week he may be a little bit \"prejudiced\" in favor of TikTok because he said it helped him win over young voters in 2024.",
      "\"I'm a little prejudiced because I frankly did so well on it,\" he said. \"It got me numbers that nobody's ever even heard of before.\"",

    "summary": "The two sides will spend the next two weeks presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that threatens to dismantle the search giant's empire.",
    "story": [
      "After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising.",
      "The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue.",
      "Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions.",
      "Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission.",
      "No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined.",
      "The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive.",
      "If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology \u2014 a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would \"invite disruption and damage\" to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years.",
      "Google believes it has already made enough changes to its \"Ad Manager\" system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling.",
      "The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct.",
      "In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month.",
      "Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist \u2014 a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion \u2014 an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April.",
      "In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial.",
      "As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's \"radical\" proposals.",
      "The Justice Department is \"fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,\" Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial.",

      "Mr. Trump on Saturday renewed his call to reestablish a U.S. presence at Bagram, even saying \"we're talking now to Afghanistan\" about the matter. He did not offer further details about the purported conversations. Asked by a reporter if he'd consider deploying U.S. troops to take the base, the president demurred.",

      "In August last year, the Taliban celebrated the third anniversary of their takeover at Bagram with a grand military display of abandoned U.S. hardware, catching the eye of the White House.

      "Washington \u2014 Gary Cohn, IBM vice chair and former National Economic Council director in President Trump's first term, said Sunday that \"we've seen the job market degrade,\" though he noted that it may be \"temporary.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve itself and the board of governors admitted that we are having a declining job market. And we see that,\" Cohn said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, in the first rate cut since December, amid slower economic growth and a stalling labor market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has a dual mandate to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, said \"what's different now is that you see a very different picture of the risks to the labor market.\" And though Powell noted that he didn't want to put \"too much emphasis on payroll job creation,\" he said \"it's just one of the things that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off.\"",
      "\"That tells you that it's time to take that into account,\" Powell said.",
      "Meanwhile the jobs numbers, which have shown an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, have been under scrutiny in recent weeks, as the administration has questioned the validity of the government data. Last month, President Trump fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a disappointing July jobs report.",
      "Cohn pointed to job data on Sunday, saying, \"over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month.\" And he noted that \"I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have.\"",
      "The IBM vice chair outlined that when companies are put in a \"very difficult environment,\" with input costs going up due to tariffs and other reasons, and they're unable to raise prices on consumers, \"the one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is they can cut down on the cost of labor.\"",
      "\"We came out of a tough situation in COVID where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people, so they were hoarding labor,\" Cohn said. \"So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses, and the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor.\"",
      "Cohn said companies are now \"letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system.\" He said in the data, \"I think it's clearly showing up, and the Federal Reserve recognized that in this week's action.\"",
      "Cohn said he didn't think this change is specific to tech, but \"across the board.\" He noted that he's \"heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their human capital overhead.\"",
      "On the rate cut more broadly, Cohn said \"the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week,\" pointing to the rate cut, along with Fed officials providing their outlook, with projections of where they think interest rates are going. And he also noted that \"what is also important is the committee was fairly unanimous,\" acknowledging concerns about the independence of the Fed that have come to a head in recent weeks.",
      "\"I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers,\" he said. \"They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a projection that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.\"",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron said it was out of line for Charles Kushner, the U.S. ambassador to France and the father of President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, to publicly accuse him of taking insufficient action to combat antisemitism, and for him to link France's foreign policy positions to domestic incidents of violence against Jews in France.",
      "In a letter he published in the Wall Street Journal to Macron in August, Kushner wrote that he had \"deep concern over the dramatic rise of antisemitism in France and the lack of sufficient action by your government to confront it.\"",
      "\"Public statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France,\" he wrote, urging Macron to \"enforce hate-crime laws without exception; ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, prosecute offenders to the fullest extent; and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\"",
      "In an interview with \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Thursday in Paris, Macron called Kushner's criticism a \"mistake\" and an \"unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat.\"",
      "\"This is unacceptable,\" he said.",

The French ministry said Kushner's claims \"run counter to international law,\" citing the \"obligation not to interfere in the internal affairs of states\" in the 1961 Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations.",
      "Kushner also wrote that \"anti-Zionism is antisemitism \u2014 plain and simple.\"",
      "The State Department said at the time in a statement to the Associated Press, that Kushner \"is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role.\"",
      "Macron acknowledged that at times people who criticize the state of Israel and its government may be motivated by hate of Jews, but rejected the idea that any of his criticism of the policies of the Netanyahu government is inherently anti-semitic.",
      "He told Brennan, \"I was the first president in France to adopt the definition of antisemitism, making it the equivalent of anti-Zionism.\"",
      "Macron firmly rejected the notion that his objections to the killing in Gaza or his call for the creation of a Palestinian state is inherently antisemitic or puts at risk French Jews. He argued \"it doesn't mean that you are not allowed to be in disagreement with the government of Israel.\" Disagreeing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"doesn't make me an antisemitic,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu currently leads the most right- wing government in Israeli history, opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, and has waged a nearly two- year- long war in Gaza that succeeded in killing the Hamas leaders who carried out the bloody October 7th terrorist attack that killed 1200 of his people. The war since that time has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, and his policies including a blockade of humanitarian aid has led to famine in Gaza.",
      "Hamas still operates in Gaza, and Macron said Hamas continues to be able to recruit more fighters despite Israel killing the top echelons of the terror group. The failure to eliminate support for Hamas via military force is proof, Macron argues, that support is needed for an alternate government in the form of the Palestinian Authority.",
      "Netanyahu accused Macron of fueling antisemitism after the French president announced France would recognize Palestinian statehood this Monday at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.",
      "The high-level gathering of world leaders and their representatives, and other countries, including the U.K., Australia and Canada, also plan to join France in recognizing Palestinian statehood. The majority of the world's countries - 147 UN members - recognize the right of Palestinians to self-determination but the decision by Western powers including UN Security Council member France and UK is symbolically significant. It is also a sign of the increased isolation of the current Israeli government, which has refused to end the nearly two year war in Gaza.",
      "The plan developed by France and Saudi Arabia involves several phases, including a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Hamas releasing the remaining hostages it's held since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel and the restoration of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Those conditions would have to be met before France opens an embassy there, Macron said. The second phase involves Gaza's reconstruction and governance and the third phase focuses on a two-state solution.",
      "Macron succeeded in getting Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, the 90-year-old leader who governs the Occupied West Bank, to publicly denounce Hamas and agree to reform the Authority and hold elections.",
      "\"Recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop,\" Macron said.",
      "The position puts France in direct conflict with the Trump administration, which blocked Palestinian Authority members from obtaining visas to attend the diplomatic gathering. Despite President Trump's statements that starvation is happening in Gaza and Israel should end its war there, Netanyahu has brushed off any American urging to do so. Recently Trump said he 'wasn't thrilled' with Netanyahu's decision to bomb US ally Qatar while Hamas members were meeting to discuss a US proposal to end the Gaza war.",
      "The current U.S. administration also appears to oppose the creation of a Palestinian State, with Trump supporting a proposal to remove Gazans and send them to other countries. The U.S. remains a staunch supporter of Israel, as well as its main weapons provider.",

It says Pentagon reporters may lose their press credentials for \"unauthorized access, attempted unauthorized access, or unauthorized disclosure\" of classified information or anything designated as \"controlled unclassified information.\"",
      "The memo also says \"DoW information must be approved before public release \u2026 even if it is unclassified.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-designating-antifa-terrorist-organization/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 10:18:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Legal experts say Trump lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, but the planned move could still affect some law enforcement approaches.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced on social media Wednesday that he's designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization.\" But what that action would mean for the movement remains unclear, given that antifa has no official leadership or organization structure, and the president lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, experts say.",
      "The president's announcement comes as he and his supporters continue to denounce \"radical left wing political violence\" following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week. After Kirk's killing, Mr. Trump blamed rhetoric from the \"radical left,\" saying that it is \"directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"",
      "Officials described the attack on Kirk as \"targeted,\" and family members of the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, said he had \"become more political\" in recent years. Robinson wrote in text messages to his roommate that he had carried out the attack because he \"had enough of [Kirk's] hatred,\" according to court filings. There has not been evidence presented to the public linking Robinson to antifa.",
      "This is not the first time Mr. Trump has argued antifa poses a threat \u2014 in his first term, he claimed the movement was behind looting and rioting during protests against police brutality in 2020. A November 2021 report on anarchist and left-wing violence in the U.S. from George Washington University's Program on Extremism and the National Counterrorism, Innovation, Technology and Education Center noted that the first Trump administration largely labeled the threat from anarchist violent extremists as originating from antifa.",
      "What is antifa?",
      "Short for \"anti-fascist,\" antifa activism can be traced back to antiracists who opposed the activities of members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, according to a June 2020 report from the Congressional Research Service. But the movement gained attention after the violent clashes between white nationalists and anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.",
      "The Congressional Research Service describes antifa as \"decentralized\" and lacking a \"unifying organizational structure or detailed ideology.\" Instead, it consists of \"independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals\" that largely believe in the principles of anarchism, socialism and communism.",
      "\"There is no single organization called antifa. That's just not the way these activists have ever organized themselves,\" said Michael Kenney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has studied antifa. \"There's tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.\"",
      "The FBI has warned about violence perpetrated by antifa adherents, and in 2017, then-FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress that the bureau was looking into \"a number of what we would call anarchist extremist investigations, where we have properly predicated subjects who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology,\" according to CRS.",
      "Wray, who was appointed FBI director by Mr. Trump during his first term, also acknowledged in congressional testimony in 2019 that the FBI doesn't investigate ideology, but does investigate violence. Then, in 2020, he said antifa is a \"movement or an ideology,\" not an organization.",
      "A 2020 assessment from the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that far-right attacks and plots have outpaced those from other perpetrators, including far-left networks. A 2022 study from the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism also found that \"right-wing extremists\" are more violent than left-wing actors.",
      "But CSIS said its data has indicated a rise in violent activity by \"antifa extremists, anarchists and related far-left extremists,\" which it said is likely connected to the \"concurrent increase in violent far-right activity.\"",
      "What could Trump's suggested designation do?",
      "Mr. Trump announced in May 2020 that the U.S. would be designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization following nationwide unrest in response to the death of George Floyd,\" but nothing followed from that.",
      "Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the president does not have the authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, even if this were an \"organization.\"",
      "\"There is no legal mechanism that I'm aware of within U.S. code that would give the president or the federal government the power to declare a domestic 'group' as a major terrorist organization or a major terrorist group,\" he said.",
      "The administration could, however, shift antifa to a higher priority for federal law enforcement, Baumgartner said, which could lead to more frequent investigations or arrests.",
      "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security don't officially designate U.S. extremist groups as \"domestic terrorist organizations,\" in part because of First Amendment concerns, according to CRS.",
      "A 2023 report from the research entity also noted that the government does not provide a \"precise, comprehensive, and public explanation of any particular groups it might consider to be domestic terrorist organizations,\" and it warned that listing groups in that way may infringe on free speech rights or \"the act of belonging to an ideological group, which in and of itself is not a crime in the United States.\"",
      "\"At this point, it's not a crime in America to have 'leftist' political beliefs along the lines that some anti-fascists do,\" Kenney said.",
      "He added that designating groups as domestic terrorist organizations could also raise Fourth Amendment concerns regarding surveillance.",
      "\"Do we as Americans still enjoy the right to free speech, to nonviolent political expression of our views, however unpalatable the Trump administration might find those views? Yes,\" Kenney said.",
      "While the U.S. does not have a list of domestic terrorist organizations, it does have a Foreign Terrorist Organizations list. Among the groups on the list are Hamas, al Qaeda and ISIS, which are known to operate transnationally. These groups are not related to the antifa movement.",
      "Kenney said that if the president were to try to designate antifa as a foreign terrorist organization, it would unlock tools like economic sanctions to bring greater pressure on the movement. Mr. Trump hasn't said he has this in mind, though he said he'd recommend \"those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated.\" A foreign terrorist designation, if it were possible, would make it a crime to provide material support to antifa. Making this designation would present other challenges, however.",
      "\"When the president refers to antifa, whether in remarks to reporters or speeches, he's usually referring to domestic non-state actors and domestic incidents, so how are they going to portray that as foreign? That's not clear to me,\" Kenney said.",
      "Can the Justice Department charge someone associated with antifa with domestic terrorism?",
      "No. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as \"violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\" But it is not a chargeable offense under federal law.",
      "\"You can't prosecute an ideology,\" Baumgartner said.",
      "But there are numerous federal criminal statutes that could apply to domestic terrorism.",
      "In the case of Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine Black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, he was convicted of 33 counts of federal hate crimes, obstruction of religious exercise and firearms charges.",
      "Payton Gendron, who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, is facing federal hate crime and weapons charges. Gendron also pleaded guilty to a state terrorism charge.",
      "Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia criminalize the act of domestic terrorism, according to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law. In 21 states and D.C., it is a crime to provide support to further an act of terrorism or a terror.",
      "Harsher punishments a possibility",
      "But Baumgartner said that where alleged domestic terrorism does come into play at the federal level is in increased penalties for perpetrators. Prosecutors have sought harsher punishments for felony offenses that \"involved, or was intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked federal judges in 2023 to apply a terrorism adjustment in cases involving members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right organizations whose members were convicted on charges stemming from the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, including seditious conspiracy.",
      "When ex-Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was sentenced for multiple crimes related to the riot, prosecutors succeeded in applying the terrorism enhancement to his sentencing, although the judge did not allow it to heavily affect the length of the 22-year sentence. Mr. Trump issued Tarrio a full pardon upon taking office in January. He also commuted the sentences of members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers.",

    "summary": "Trump administration figures have vowed to pursue anyone who mocks or celebrates Kirk's death, alarming First Amendment advocates.",
    "story": [
      "In the week since conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated at a Utah university event, comments from some of his critics have ignited a battle over free speech in an increasingly polarized nation.",
      "Kirk, who routinely debated progressive students at his Turning Point USA events and espoused controversial opinions on his podcast, was a stalwart proponent of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Hate speech does not exist legally in America,\" he wrote on X last year. \"There's ugly speech. There's gross speech. There's evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment.\"",
      "But over the last several days, the administration he supported and the president he helped reelect have vowed to crack down on some speech about his death.",
      "Last week, Pentagon officials promised to \"address\" federal employees who mock or celebrate Kirk's death. On Monday, the State Department said it will revoke visas\u00a0over social posts that \"celebrate\" Kirk's death.",
      "That same day, Vice President JD Vance hosted Kirk's podcast and encouraged listeners to call the employers of anyone \"celebrating Charlie's murder.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday said people who post \"hate speech\" should be \"shut down\" and suggested that the Trump administration would pursue people who engage in hate speech.",
      "\"There's free speech, and then there's hate speech,\" Bondi said in an\u00a0interview. \"We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.\" The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld free speech rights, even if it is hate speech. She later said on X that \"hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected.\" The Justice Department referred CBS News to Bondi's comments when asked whether the administration considers celebrations of Kirk's assassination as threats of violence.",
      "\"Democrat critics are lying about the Administration's actions \u2014 this effort will target those committing criminal acts and hold them accountable,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Asked about Bondi's remarks, President Trump told ABC News' Jonathan Karl on Tuesday: \"We'll probably go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly; it's hate.\"",
      "Kimmel \"indefinitely\" taken off air",
      "Late Wednesday, ABC announced it would \"indefinitely\" pre-empt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr said the network should \"take action\" for the comedian's suggestion that Kirk's alleged killer is a Trump supporter. ABC's move came after station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they were pulling the show indefinitely. Carr thanked Nexstar and Sinclair for taking action.",
      "Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the FCC to approve it. Nexstar told CBS News in a statement it made the decision to pre-empt Kimmel \"unilaterally\" and did not consult with the FCC beforehand.",
      "On Truth Social, Mr. Trump referred to it as a cancellation and congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\" and added: \"That leaves Jimmy [Fallon] and Seth [Meyers], two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!\"",
      "Anna Gomez, one of two FCC commissioners working with Carr and the lone Democrat on the commission, called Kimmel's penalty a dangerous new precedent.",
      "\"This administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression, not because it glorifies violence or breaks the law, but because it challenges those in power and reflects views they oppose,\" she said on CNN Wednesday.",
      "In a statement on Thursday, she added: \"This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes. \u2026 Free speech is the foundation of our democracy, and we must push back against any attempt to erode it.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, also criticized the move.",
      "\"When the head of the FCC is talking openly about taking away the broadcast license, then that is the government trying to exercise censorship. It's not a question of whether you agree with Mr. Kimmel or disagree with Mr. Kimmel. The point is one of the government not coming in and making decisions about whose speech gets heard,\" she said, adding, \"Everyone should care, no matter what your political view is.\"",
      "After a week of controversy, Disney said Kimmel's show will return on Tuesday, Sept. 23. The company said some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive,\" but after several days of \"thoughtful conversations with Jimmy ... we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.\"",
      "The First Amendment and hateful speech",
      "In general, the First Amendment \u2014 which bars the government from \"abridging the freedom of speech\" \u2014 protects most forms of hateful speech, aside from a narrow set of exceptions that include threats of violence and incitement.",
      "Bondi's initial comments about hate speech stood out among those made by administration officials because of her position as the nation's top prosecutor, said Adam Goldstein, vice president of strategic initiatives at the nonprofit Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.",
      "\"I especially don't want to see an attorney in charge of the Justice Department saying that,\" he said. \"It's the kind of thing that would get you a bad grade in your constitutional law class.\"",
      "Jenin Younes, a First Amendment attorney who worked on a case accusing the Biden administration of social media censorship, told CBS News, \"These are all the same people who were railing against cancel culture and the idea of hate speech just a few years ago, when it was the left doing it.\"",
      "\"The worry is that lawmakers will just define hate speech to mean anything the opposite party says, and so that's why the court has said it's not up to the government to decide what's within the bounds of acceptable discourse and what's not,\" Genevieve Lakier, a University of Chicago law professor, told CBS News. \"There's no definition of hate speech, because the whole point is there's no neutral definition of hate speech.\"",
      "In most cases, Lakier said, \"simply saying 'he had it coming' \u2026 does not fit the very, very, very narrow definition of incitement that is available in the case law.\"",
      "Are offensive comments illegal?",
      "First Amendment legal scholar Eugene Volokh told CBS News that, in most circumstances, the government cannot go after ordinary people for making insensitive or offensive public comments about Kirk's killing.",
      "\"It may be in bad taste. It may be bad for the country when people are trying to normalize political violence. But it is protected by the First Amendment,\" said Volokh, a professor emeritus of law at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\"I would say it's basically prohibited for the government to say you can't mock or make fun of or even celebrate his death,\" said Younes, who currently serves as national legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.",
      "Volokh says comments like Bondi's \"are likely to further confuse people, whether citizens or law enforcement or others, about what's protected and what's not protected.\"",
      "\"I think they may also kind of send a message that we are going to try to find a way of punishing this speech,\" Volokh added.",
      "Bondi also said Monday the Justice Department could prosecute businesses that refuse to print photos of Kirk for customers, citing a worker at an Office Depot who declined to print flyers for a Kirk vigil. Office Depot called the incident \"completely unacceptable\" and said the staff member no longer works for the company.",
      "\"There is no federal law that prohibits copy shops or print shops from discriminating based on the content of the message,\" Volokh said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Bondi was solely referencing the Office Depot incident, which the department's civil rights division looked into.",
      "Less clear, according to legal experts, is whether the federal government can deport non-citizens or revoke their visas over their views on Kirk, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio has floated. Volokh says the laws around this are \"unsettled.\"",
      "\"While it is true that the executive's power when it comes to immigration is very vast, I think the First Amendment constrains it,\" Younes said. She pointed to the Trump administration's attempts to remove students for participating in pro-Palestinian protests, which have been met with pushback at the district court level.",
      "What can private companies do?",
      "The First Amendment doesn't stop private employers from choosing to fire people for speech, though some states like California have their own legal protections.",
      "However, in some cases, it can be illegal for the government to use its power to pressure a private company into firing a staff member \u2014 a concept known as \"jawboning.\"",
      "Government officials can try to persuade private companies to take a certain action, according to Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, but they cannot coerce companies by making threats.",
      "Volokh said it likely doesn't qualify as jawboning if elected officials merely express the view that people should be fired, as long as they don't cross the line into threatening to take action. For example, on Vance's call for people to contact the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's death, Volokh said, \"it's hard to see that as unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"You would have to show the private employer didn't want to fire you, but they were just acting because they were afraid of some kind of repercussions from the government,\" noted Younes.",
      "There's a fine line between broadly encouraging companies to fire employees who praised Kirk's assassination, and giving instructions to specific firms, according to Goldstein. He pointed to a contrast between Vance's comments advising podcasts listeners to call people's employers, and a tweet by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.",
      "Duffy praised American Airlines, United and Delta for suspending employees, and wrote, \"The next step should be to fire them.\"",
      "\"A rational airline who sees this message might feel some coercive effect on their decision making,\" said Goldstein, noting Duffy's power over the airline industry.",
      "Lakier said it's not a violation of the First Amendment if a company fires an employee of their own volition. But, she said, \"the problem is, in many of these cases, it's going to be because of political sympathy.\"",
      "\"The employers who are firing them, maybe implicitly fear that if they don't, they're going to face the government's wrath or they want to curry favor by firing,\" she said.",
      "In general, however, \"If we're talking about private companies and you are an at-will employee, then that means exactly as it sounds like, which is that an employer can fire you at will,\" said CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School.",
      "Government workers have some free speech protections, but it's complicated",
      "In many cases, Trump allies have spotlighted public employees who criticize Kirk.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called celebrations of Kirk's death by service members or civilian workers \"unacceptable\" last week, and said the Pentagon is \"tracking\" them. Since then, at least one Marine officer has been relieved of his recruiting duties pending an investigation into his post about Kirk, and two Army officers have been suspended pending a review into their posts, according to a Marine official and an Army official.",
      "A Secret Service agent who expressed negative opinions about Kirk on Facebook was also placed on leave last week.",
      "At the state level, Oklahoma's top education official has said teachers who celebrate Kirk's assassination \"will be banned from teaching,\" and teachers in several other states have been investigated or placed on leave over their comments. Others have pushed for action against employees at public colleges like Clemson University.",
      "People who work for the government have some free speech protections, especially for speech that they make while off the clock, legal experts say.",
      "\"Government employees do have First Amendment rights of freedom of speech,\" said Calvert. \"However, those rights are not unlimited and may be restricted if the employee's speech somehow interferes with the ability of the employer \u2026 to effectively and efficiently deliver its services to the public.\"",
      "Calvert said \"every case is going to be unique.\"",
      "Prior court rulings have established several factors for assessing the speech rights of government employees, according to Calvert and Volokh. Those include whether the worker spoke in their personal capacity, whether it relates to a matter of public concern and whether the worker's right to speak out outweighs the government's interest in delivering its services.",
      "But the military is a slightly separate case, according to Volokh, because \"there are more restrictions that are permissible on service members' speech.\"",
      "Volokh said the military is different \"in part because of a sense that \u2026 this is an environment where discipline is really important, where self-discipline is really important, where unit cohesion is really important, where commitment to the right ideas is very important.\"",
      "\"It's going very, very far\"",
      "Some First Amendment advocates are uncomfortable with vocal calls for people to be fired \u2014 even if they don't run afoul of the Constitution.",
      "\"It's going very, very far. This is not being limited to people saying, 'I'm glad Charlie Kirk is dead and I wish everyone like him was dead, too,'\" Younes said. \"It's being applied to people who just are saying they didn't like Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "Goldstein said that some officials may be understandably lashing out after the death of their friend, but particularly in the context of Kirk's career as free speech advocate, the reaction has gone too far.",

Two of the Vibrio vulnificus deaths in Louisiana this year were in people who ate contaminated raw oysters, the state health department said in August.",
      "Louisiana and other states have been seeing an increase in Vibrio vulnificus diagnoses. Experts suggest the trend may be because of\u00a0warming oceans.

      "Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects preserved in amber for the first time in South America, providing a fresh glimpse into life on Earth at a time when flowering plants were just beginning to diversify and spread around the world.",
      "Many of the specimens found at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador date to 112 million years ago, said Fabiany Herrera, curator of fossil plants at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. At least six types of arthropods were found preserved, according to the study.",
      "Almost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's long been \"an enigma\" that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.",
      "This marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.",
      "\"Amber pieces are little windows into the past,\" P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.",
      "The researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that's on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.",
      "Two types of amber were discovered, according to the study: There was a more common form of amber found around the roots of resin-producing plants, and a rarer form of the material formed from resin exposed to air. The amber formed around the roots did not hold any specimens, the study said.",
      "\"A different kind of forest\"",
      "The discoveries provide evidence that the area was once a \"humid, resinous forest ecosystem,\" according to the study.",
      "But today's rainforest is much different from what dinosaurs roamed through, Herrera said. Based on an analysis of fossils in the amber, the ancient rainforest contained species of ferns and conifers, including the unusual Monkey Puzzle Tree, that no longer grow in Amazonia.",
      "\"It was a different kind of forest,\" said Herrera.",
      "The amber deposits were previously known to geologists and miners who worked at the Genoveva quarry. Study co-author Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute first heard of them about a decade ago and set out to find the exact location, aided by geology field notes.",
      "\"I went there and realized this place is amazing,\" Jaramillo said. \"There's so much amber in the mines,\" and it's more visible in the open quarry than it would be if hidden under dense layers of vegetation.",
      "Researchers will continue to analyze the amber trove to learn more about Cretaceous-era biodiversity \u2014 including the insects that contributed to evolution by feeding on flowering plants. \"Amber tends to preserve things that are tiny,\" said Grimaldi.",
      "\"It's the time when the relationship between flowering plants and insects got started,\" said P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente. \"And that turned out to be one of the most successful partnerships in nature.\"",

    "story": [
      "In the forests of Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, chimps crowd into fig and plum trees, feasting on fruit that's sweet, soft and just a little boozy. A new study shows those daily snacks quietly add up to the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages for humans.",
      "A team of scientists at University of California Berkeley and other institutions tested the fruit chimps actually snack on: figs in Uganda's canopy and the plum-like fruits on the forest floor in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Collecting the data wasn't easy \u2014 with little electricity beyond solar panels and constant humidity threatening the instruments, researchers spent three seasons hauling equipment and calibrating test kits to measure alcohol in many different tropical fruits.",
      "In the end, they found that on average, the fruit's alcohol content came in at about .3% by weight. This is kombucha-level, but when chimpanzees eat 10 pounds of fruit a day and weigh around 90 pounds, it adds up to about 14 grams of ethanol, equating to about two cocktails for a human.",
      "But don't picture chimps swinging drunkenly from the trees. To actually get drunk, they'd have to binge on fruit until their bellies ballooned, the researchers said. Instead, they're exposed to a steady low dose, a quiet buzz from nature's own fermentation process.",
      "Senior author of the paper and UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology Robert Dudley first floated the \"drunken monkey\" hypothesis in 2000, arguing that our attraction to alcohol could come from ancestral fruit-eating habits. Dudley argued that it makes sense primates would be tuned to alcohol, since their diets have long revolved around ripe fruit.",
      "\"Once you start eating, it acts as an aperitif,\" he said. \"The pleasure of association with drinking alcohol increases feeding rates.\"",
      "Other animals chase the same buzz too.",
      "\"Open a bottle of beer outside and a fruit fly appears almost instantly,\" Dudley said.",
      "Spider monkeys in Panama, slow lorises in Malaysia and even elephants have been documented consuming naturally fermented fruit or nectar.",
      "What makes this study different is that it provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in the fruits that wild chimps routinely eat, and then connects those numbers to daily intake.",
      "The open question is whether chimps are actually selecting fruit for its alcohol content or just chasing sugar and calories. Either way, Dudley says the story connects to us.",
      "\"We inherited the taste for alcohol,\" Dudley said. \"Even though our diets have diversified \u2026 that bias to consume quickly when this molecule is present could still be a powerful force.\"",

      "The capture came after Northrop Grumman engineers adjusted the sensitivity of the main engine fault detection software that prematurely triggered shutdowns during two rendezvous thruster firings Tuesday.",
      "As it turned out, the main engine was healthy all along and once the software was adjusted, the spacecraft was able to press ahead with the rendezvous, pulling up to a point just below the station so robot arm operator Jonny Kim, assisted by Zena Cardman, could capture the ship.",

      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "In the meantime, a senior White House official said Monday that the U.S. and China had reached agreement on the basic details of the app's ownership. The new structure will move TikTok's U.S. operations under a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S. that will control the algorithm and oversee security, the official said.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will control the TikTok algorithm?",
      "According to the White House official, the new arrangement will operate and control a copy of the algorithm. Software maker Oracle will \"provide sort of top to bottom security\" throughout the company, the official said, noting that will involve monitoring the technology as well as managing how American data is stored.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the White House official said.",
      "Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "Mr. Trump, asked last week about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. Last week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, last week told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "Asked about this structure last week, Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, told CBS MoneyWatch that as she understands it, ByteDance would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use the algorithm under certain terms.",
      "\"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it,\" she said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch before details of the new structure were announced.",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, said the new arrangement has to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",

      "The case, announced\u00a0by the Federal Trade Commission in 2023, centers on claims that Amazon engaged in what the agency said amounted to a \"years-long effort\" to trick millions of customers into automatically renewing their Prime subscriptions, specifically by using user-interface designs that were \"manipulative, coercive or deceptive.\"",
      "When it announced legal action against Amazon two years ago, the FTC said consumers who used Amazon to make purchases were presented with numerous options to subscribe to Prime, but that it was less clear how to buy an item without signing up for a membership. In some cases, the button for Amazon users to complete their purchase did not clearly indicate that they were also agreeing to enroll in Prime, according to regulators.",
      "The government's\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0also alleges that Amazon obfuscated the process to cancel a Prime subscription by forcing customers to jump through several hoops to end their membership.",
      "An FTC spokesperson declined to comment on the case.",

      "\"The glasses make my life easier,\" said the 27 year old. \"They make things faster and they make me able to do more in the day because it's just quicker and easier to do things and I feel less tired at the end of the day.\"",
      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",

      "Users are able to connect their glasses to the \"Be My Eyes\" app which connects blind and visually impaired users with volunteers to assist with recognizing objects and managing everyday tasks in real time. Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail.

When using some of the AI-powered features, the glasses' battery died, and so she regularly had to keep them in their case to charge.",
      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence. But in the end, the glasses do not \"replace the need for human capacity,\" Riccobo said. \"So we need to teach blind people and we still need to make sure that blind people develop the skills that blind people need to be successful.\"",

      "\"They get super fat, and it's really important to get fat. A fat bear is a healthy bear,\" she explained. \"So they're eating about a year's worth of food within the span of five to six months. When they go into hibernation, they're not eating anymore, so they survive on their fat stores.\"",
      "And what does the winner of Fat Bear Week get?",
      "\"Their prize is winning and surviving another winter season, which is the most difficult season for these bears,\" Bruce said.",
      "Meet the 2025 Fat Bear Week contenders",
      "Fat Bear Week contenders were announced during a livestream on Monday without issue, after last year's bracket reveal was\u00a0postponed following a skirmish between two Alaskan grizzlies that led to the death of one of the animals.",
      "While around 80 bears frequent the Brooks River during their active season, 12 bears are chosen for Fat Bear Week because of certain criteria, including whether there are before and after photographs of the bears, park ranger and photographer Ashleigh Monaco said Monday.",
      "Fitz said the competition is subjective and voters can place their vote for their favorite bear.",
      "These are the bears vying to be this year's champion:",
      "Fat Bear Jr. winner 128 Jr., or \"Biggie,\" is the offspring of 128. The dark fur bear is about 1 1/2 years old. She had a sibling who was unable to survive last summer, according to Monaco.",
      "\"While it is tragic that that cub didn't survive, it just goes to show 128's strength and resiliency in overcoming the challenges of living on the Brooks River herself,\" Monaco said.",
      "Going against 128 Jr. in the bracket's first quadrant is 5-year-old 609, the daughter of 909 and the champion of Fat Bear Jr. 2022. She has noticeably large round ears and a long nose.",
      "Either 128 Jr. or 609 will face off against 602, a newbie to the competition.",
      "He loves lounging and taking long naps by the river, Monaco said, and he dominated the category of size and strength this summer. Nicknamed \"Flow-tato,\" 602 is often spotted doing \"a little stomping dance,\" possibly a response to high adrenaline or excitement.",
      "In the bracket's second quadrant is 503. The 12-year-old is resourceful, playful and tolerant, allowing the younger bears to sometimes take his leftovers.",
      "This 7-year-old bear has \"never been fatter,\" said Naomi Boak, a media ranger at Katmai. In 2023, 901 had three cubs, but none of them survived.",
      "\"But she's back, and she's big,\" Boak said, adding that cubs could be in her future next season.",
      "Either 503 or 901 will have to face 32 Chunk, the runner-up of last year's Fat Bear Week. He was among the most dominant bears last year, but this year he is healing from a broken jaw, possibly from an altercation with another male over a female, according to Boak.",
      "\"That's a typical injury, and it's not an easy injury to live with, but he has powered through his injury,\" Boak said. \"He is fishing and he is getting fatter than ever.\"",
      "In the third quadrant is 26, a mother bear with twins \"with plenty of energy and spunk,\" said photographer Christine Loberg.",
      "This is the daughter of the 2018 Fat Bear Week champion, 409 Beadnose. 909 loves catching fish by the waterfall, simply catching them with her mouth.",
      "The mother of this year's Fat Bear Jr. champion is approximately 20 years old. Also known as Grazer, she stands out with her blond fur.",
      "Bear 99 is identifiable by his chocolate milk-color coat, according to Bruce. While he's still quite young, he has got enough fish this year to land him in the fat bear bracket.",
      "The next bear in the fourth quadrant is 856, who Bruce called \"the old man of the river.\" He's one of the oldest bears on the Brooks River.",
      "The last 2025 Fat Bear Week contender is 910. She's described as a rectangle and a cruise ship because of how large she is.",

So it's an exciting time to be here.\"",
      "Menon worked for NASA for seven years as a biomedical researcher and flight controller before joining SpaceX in 2018. She served as a senior engineer and was later selected as the onboard medical officer during the commercial Polaris Dawn\u00a0mission, chartered by billionaire Jared Isaacman.",
      "She married her husband Anil in 2016 while both were working for NASA. A former Air Force flight surgeon, Anil Menon joined SpaceX as its first medical officer in 2018.

    "summary": "President Trump is following through on his vow to designate antifa as a terrorist group \u2014 but the move's legal impact is unclear.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed an executive order Monday labeling antifa a \"domestic terrorist organization\" \u2014 though the move's legal impact is unclear.",
      "The executive order directs Trump administration officials to investigate and thwart \"any and all illegal operations\" allegedly carried out by antifa members, and to pursue people who \"fund such operations\" or provide material support to them.",
      "The president promised to designate antifa as a \"major terrorist organization\" last week in the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, although officials have not said there was a link between his killing and any left-wing groups.",
      "It's not clear what happens next. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, typically refers to a loose affiliation of mostly left-wing activists, and isn't generally considered to be an organized group with a clear leadership structure. And the U.S. doesn't have a statute that gives the president the power to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations or charge people with domestic terrorism, legal experts told CBS News last week.",
      "In a fact sheet, the White House argued antifa \"has a long history of terrorizing our communities.\" It listed out several attacks on or threats against law enforcement agencies and pro-Trump events in recent years, some of which were allegedly carried out by people who self-identified with antifa.",
      "The White House also cited Kirk's assassination as an example of a \"trend of Radical Left violence.\" Authorities say Kirk's suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, had become \"more political\" in recent years and lashed out against Kirk's \"hatred\" in text messages, though they have not released evidence tying Robinson to antifa.",
      "In 2020, the Congressional Research Service called antifa a \"decentralized\" movement made up of \"independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals\" who typically believe in socialism, communism and anarchism. It said followers of antifa lack a singular organizational structure, set of ideological views or common list of enemies.",
      "University of Pittsburgh professor Michael Kenney told CBS News last week there is \"no single organization called antifa,\" adding: \"There's tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.\"",
      "The antifa movement's roots date back to opponents of neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan in the 1980s, and an Oregon-based group became the first organization to use the term \"antifa\" in its name in 2007, according to the Congressional Research Service. The group gained more attention a decade later, during the clashes between far-right groups and their opponents in Charlottesville, Virginia, early in Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Mr. Trump and his appointees first vowed to crack down on antifa in his first term, with the president calling for antifa to be designated a terrorist group in 2020. He did not follow through on that threat.",
      "In 2017, then-FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress the agency was carrying out \"anarchist extremist investigations\" against suspects \"who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology,\" CRS notes. Three years later, Wray described antifa as a \"movement or an ideology,\" not a singular group.",
      "Mr. Trump's latest push could face legal hurdles. Unlike with foreign terrorist organizations, there isn't a legal mechanism for the president to designate a domestic terrorist group, Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, told CBS News last week. But the administration could choose to make antifa-related incidents a higher priority for federal law enforcement, he noted.",
      "Domestic terrorism also is not a chargeable offense under federal law, though most states have a domestic terrorism statute, and other federal criminal statutes could be applied to alleged domestic terrorists.",
      "\"You can't prosecute an ideology,\" Baumgartner said.",

      "This story is a CBS News collaboration with the Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina.",
      "The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million of federal grants for animal testing as major federal health agencies are phasing out research on live animals in favor of new alternatives, a joint investigation by CBS News and The Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, has found.",
      "\"We're witnessing a watershed moment right now,\" said Justin Goodman, the senior vice president of White Coat Waste, an animal rights nonprofit. \"We have an administration that's skeptical of spending, skeptical of establishment science. \u2026 We are trying to slash and burn as much animal testing funding as possible.\"",
      "The pressure for change comes from an unlikely coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress who want to halt what animal rights groups estimate as $20 billion a year in federal spending for animal experiments. Long considered a cause of the left, the animal rights movement has expanded and gained steam under the Trump administration. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is leading the charge against high drug costs, vaccine safety and the grinding approval process required to bring innovations to market.",
      "Animal tests, often involving painful experiments that end in euthanasia, have played a crucial role in developing novel vaccines for COVID-19, malaria, polio and popular medications such as Tylenol and Ozempic, which ushered in a craze for weight-loss drugs.",
      "\"In conventional medicine, those procedures, those diagnostics, those therapeutics, for the most part, were discovered in animals,\" said Steven Marks, the dean of the veterinary school at Clemson University. \"But they're changing the landscape of human health right now.\"",
      "No one knows where it will end.",
      "Since President Trump took office, all major federal health agencies have promised to phase out animal research, with varying degrees of effectiveness. The Veterans Administration says it is on track, as promised, to end all primate research that's been used to develop new treatments for neurological disorders, alcoholism and mental problems.",
      "The sprawling National Institutes of Health has agreed to phase out experiments with dogs, cats and primates, but watchdogs have found recent examples of the agency launching new animal research. Federal money has continued to flow to incomplete research projects and to contractors who breed and care for thousands of animals bound for laboratories.",
      "The effort has sparked uncertainty in South Carolina, where a research company maintains a free-ranging monkey colony on secluded Morgan Island, where nearly 4,000 federally owned rhesus monkeys bask in the sun until they are shipped off to federal laboratories.",
      "U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a Charleston Republican, has been a leader in the animal rights fight, joined by White Coat Waste, a group that counts billionaire Elon Musk among its supporters. Mace has introduced legislation to end federally funded animal research. She also recently inserted language in a House spending bill to force the NIH to justify continued spending on Morgan Island, which is more popularly known as \"Monkey Island.\"",
      "\"Honestly, it's heartbreaking,\" Goodman told CBS News and The Post and Courier on a recent visit to waters surrounding the island.",
      "As Goodman watched, rhesus mothers and babies romped on the island's sandy beach and stared down from palmetto trees. But each year, hundreds are \"taken from this wild habitat with their friends, with their families and shipped to laboratories. They're gonna be socially isolated in tiny cages by themselves and subjected to some of the most barbaric painful experiments you can imagine,\" he said.",
      "His group's mission, Goodman said, is to \"slash as much animal funding as possible.\"",
      "Patients who stand to benefit from continued animal research hang in the balance. Animal experiments have helped develop breakthrough drugs, like the immunotherapy that's saving the life of 11-month-old Max Harbin of Folly Beach, South Carolina. Max has a spinal condition that once ranked as the leading genetic cause of infant deaths.",
      "Before Max's therapy was approved for pediatric use in 2019, it went through years of studies with mice and monkeys. A Food and Drug Administration official described the therapy as a way to \"change the lives of those patients who may have faced a terminal condition.\"",
      "Max's mother Laura, an animal lover, said she was unaware of the rigorous animal experiments that led to human approval for Zolgensma, a single-dose therapy made by Novartis.",
      "\"It's odd to think that it's a step in the process, but it's a necessary one, and without it, my son would be in a very, very different place. I'm definitely grateful there's a way to test it so we know it's safe.\"",
      "Now, the FDA is now among the agencies promising to make a \"paradigm shift\" in how new drugs are approved.",
      "It wants to use new techniques like AI-based computational modeling, lab testing on human organs and data analysis to \"get safer treatments to patients faster and more reliably while also reducing R&D costs and drug prices,\" said FDA commissioner Martin Makary. \"It is a win-win for public health and ethics.\"",
      "There's still a major hurdle with phasing out all federal animal research. The science behind alternatives is rapidly evolving, but many experts say it's not yet ready to serve as the only gauge of safety and effectiveness in humans.",
      "\"I want to see us get out of the business of using animals in research,\" said Paul Locke, who is an environmental health lawyer at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and serves on the board of the school's Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing. \"The question is when. When can we do that and reach the double goal of having better science and virtually no animals? The answer is not tomorrow.\"",
      "Locke testified this year at a congressional hearing organized by Mace about the need for federal agencies to step up in support of alternative research and \"set the global standards in these fields.\"",
      "The hearing won more attention, including supportive social media posts from President Trump, about Mace's charge that the federal government spent more than $10 million to create transgender mice and other animals and study their behaviors.",
      "Parents like Justin and Rosalyn Porcano in San Rafael, California, are watching the debate with concern. Their 7-year-old daughter Lia has a rare genetic disorder, Usher Syndrome 1B. She was born deaf and is facing blindness, with no treatments currently available. Without medical advancements in treatment of the disorder, she will likely go blind by the time she's in high school.",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 20:03:09 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration announced it believes acetaminophen is linked to autism risk, but the maker of Tylenol and medical experts have strongly pushed back on the claims.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced the Food and Drug Administration believes the use of acetaminophen \u2014 the active ingredient in Tylenol and many cold and flu medications \u2014 during pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of autism, though medical experts have said the medication is safe.",
      "\"Effective immediately, the FDA will be notifying physicians that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,\" the president said.\"So, taking Tylenol is not good, alright? I'll say it. It's not good. For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary.\"",
      "\"Ideally, a woman won't take Tylenol,\" he said, and pivoted to discussion of childhood vaccination, saying vaccines should be given in \"smaller doses\" and spread out \"over a period of years,\" without citing medical evidence for his claims about vaccines. On his various vaccine recommendations, the president said, \"You know, I'm just making these statements from me, I'm not making them from these doctors.\"",
      "Kennedy said the FDA based its decision on acetaminophen on \"clinical and laboratory studies,\" that \"suggest a potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes,\" including one study in the public health journal Environmental Health, but added that \"NIH research teams are currently testing multiple hypotheses.\"",
      "However, in a major study published last year, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",
      "After Mr. Trump's announcement, the FDA shared an open letter encouraging physicians to \"consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers\" \u2014 though the agency was more cautious than some of the president's statements.",
      "\"To be clear, while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature,\" the letter states, calling the issue an \"ongoing area of scientific debate.\"",
      "The letter also stated physicians should balance the possible risks of acetaminophen with the fact that it is still safer than other over-the-counter painkillers and fever-reducing drugs during pregnancy, like aspirin and ibuprofen.",
      "The announcement comes after Kennedy said in April that HHS would undertake a \"massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism. Kennedy at the time said the plan was to release a comprehensive report in September. However, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said later that month it could be as long as a year before the findings are released.",
      "\"To meet the president's challenge, I ordered HHS to launch unprecedented, all-agency effort to identify all causes of autism, including toxic and pharmaceutical exposures,\" Kennedy said.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary also announced FDA approval of the drug leucovorin to treat autism in children. It has previously been used off-label for that purpose.",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why. Most experts say it is likely due to a combination of factors, including changes in the way the condition is diagnosed.",
      "Tylenol maker responds to autism claims",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said \"independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism.\"",
      "\"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise,\" the statement continues, highlighting what the company says is the greater health risk for expecting mothers from other conditions if they give up on taking the drug. \"Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.\"",
      "\"The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism,\" the company said, adding that it \"will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.\"",
      "Medical experts on acetaminophen and autism research",
      "In a statement to CBS News when reports of the administration's plans first surfaced, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said, \"There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"",
      "\"The best evidence does not show an association between Tylenol and autism,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. \"The medical community, the scientific community has the same consensus, which is that Tylenol, acetaminophen, is safe in pregnancy.\"",
      "Gounder said acetaminophen is considered the safest option for treating issues like pain and high fever during pregnancy.",
      "\"If you have a high fever during pregnancy, that can cause neurodevelopment issues in the baby, so you don't want to let that fever go untreated,\" Gounder explained, adding she's worried that expectant mothers may turn to other options that would be less safe.",
      "\"Will women end up taking other medications like aspirin or ibuprofen during pregnancy? Those actually can be dangerous, especially in the third trimester, you can end up with kidney issues, cardiac issues in the baby,\" she said.",
      "While some previous research suggested there could be a possible association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, those studies involved relatively small groups and did not prove a link. Larger and more robust studies have found no connection.",
      "\"Any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science and is premature given the current science,\" the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, \"Safety is the top priority for manufacturers,\" and \"the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use.\"",
      "\"Scientific and medical authorities around the world recognize acetaminophen as the only analgesic considered safe for use during pregnancy when used according to the Drug Facts label, which specifically reminds pregnant women to always consult their healthcare provider before use,\" the group said.",
      "What is leucovorin?",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said autism \"may also be due to an autoimmune reaction to a folate receptor on the brain not allowing that important vitamin to get into the brain cells.\"",
      "He announced FDA approval of the drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid (also known as folate or vitamin B9), to treat autism in children. Leucovorin is an inexpensive, generic drug that was previously approved to ease the side effects of cancer chemotherapy.",
      "Pregnant women are prescribed multivitamins with folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. The neural tube develops into the brain and spinal cord.",
      "Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"You can have a perfectly normal folate level in your blood, but it may not be getting into the brain, and so there's a defect in the transport of folate into the brain. Leucovorin works around that,\" Gounder explained. \"Not all children with autism have this defect, so there's a test you can do to assess whether that's what's at play. For those kids, leucovorin has been shown to help, particularly with speech, getting kids to be more verbal than they were before.\"",
      "Leucovorin isn't a cure for autism, but \"it could really have a substantial impact on a very good percentage of children with autism,\" Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, told CBS News earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "After being pulled off the air nearly a week ago, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" will return on Tuesday, The Walt Disney Company announced Monday.",
      "The late-night show had been \"pre-empted indefinitely\" last week following comments Kimmel made on the show in response to\u00a0the shooting death\u00a0of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "In a statement Monday, The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, said Kimmel's show was suspended \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" adding that some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "Kimmel had not yet commented on Monday on his show's return.",
      "The late-night host made the remarks in his monologue on Sept. 15, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\" He also mocked Mr. Trump's reaction to the shooting.",
      "Before Disney announced last week that Kimmel's show was \"pre-empted indefinitely,\" Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr called the remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" he said during a podcast interview, telling host Benny Johnson: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Kimmel faced criticism from conservatives over his comments. Mr. Trump last week had congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "ABC parent company Disney has faced fallout in Hollywood over the move: Other late-night hosts have publicly sided with Kimmel, A-listers like Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro signed an open letter calling it a \"dark moment for freedom of speech,\" and screenwriter and \"Lost\" co-creator Damon Lindelof vowed not to work with Disney unless Kimmel's show is restored. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who led Disney for more than two decades, spoke out and defended Kimmel last week, writing on X: \"Where has all the leadership gone? If not for university presidents, law firm managing partners, and corporate chief executives standing up against bullies, who then will step up for the first amendment?\"",
      "Carr's comments on Kimmel drew pushback on First Amendment grounds, with the FCC's sole Democrat-appointed commissioner, Anna Gomez, arguing the agency had used Kimmel's \"inopportune joke as a pretext to punish speech it disliked.\" Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas also sharply criticized Carr for urging ABC to crack down on Kimmel, calling the Trump appointee's comments \"dangerous as hell\" and \"right out of 'Goodfellas.'\" Cruz chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.",
      "ABC's announcement last week came after media giant Nexstar announced that it would preempt Kimmel's show indefinitely on all its stations over Kimmel's remarks. Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said the comments were \"offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located.\"",
      "Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it. A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "\"Regardless of ABC's plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform,\" Sinclair said last week in a statement.",
      "On Monday night, Sinclair posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-h1b-visa-faq-100000-fee-uscis/",
    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 18:15:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Heavy new H-1B visa fee raises numerous questions, immigration law experts told CBS News. Here's what employees and employers should know.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications is sowing confusion among some immigrant workers and their employers, including whether it's safe for current holders of the visa to travel outside the U.S.",
      "The new fee, which President Trump announced in a proclamation on Friday, represents a major change to a 35-year-old program that has enabled millions of immigrants to work legally in the U.S. The visa has become a mainstay in the technology industry, including among bellwethers such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, and is also widely used in the financial sector.",
      "Over the weekend, the White House sought to\u00a0clarify\u00a0the new policy, stating that the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and that it is a one-time cost required only when initially applying for the visa.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said the addition of a $100,000 charge for H-1B visas on top of the existing fees reflects President Trump's promise \"to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "She added, \"The text of the proclamation is very clear, and it is unfortunate that uninformed reporters and corporate lawyers attempt to sow chaos and confusion. Americans have another reason to celebrate unprecedented action by President Trump to protect Americans from cheap foreign labor.\"",
      "After the White House outlined the new policy on Friday, some tech companies including Google and Microsoft this weekend instructed H-1B employees who were traveling outside the U.S. to return immediately, expressing concern they might not be allowed to re-enter without the $100,000 payment, according to workers and immigration lawyers.",
      "Despite the White House's clarification that the new fee applies only to new visa applications, not existing H-1B holders, there remains \"a great degree of uncertainty on the ground,\" Parul Koul, president of the union that represents employees at Google owner Alphabet, said during a press conference on Monday to address the new policy.",
      "CBS News spoke with attorneys and other sources about the new policy \u2014 here's what to know.",
      "Who pays the $100,000 fee?",
      "Under current H-1B rules, employers pay the application fees on behalf of workers. Assuming that approach continues, that could deter many employers from picking up the additional $100,000 fees \u2014 roughly 10 times what they previously paid for an applicant, Emily Neumann, an immigration attorney and managing partner at Houston-based Reddy Neumann Brown, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Very few employers would be willing to shell out that kind of money,\" she said.",
      "Such an outcome would appear to align with the White House's goals of spurring employers to hire within the U.S. rather than recruiting foreign workers.",
      "\"It is therefore necessary to impose higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers,\" Mr. Trump said in his order.",
      "When does the fee go into effect?",
      "The new fee must be paid in submitting any new H-1B visa application and went into effect at 12:01 am EST on Sept. 21, according to a White House\u00a0statement.",
      "Each year, the federal government approves 85,000 H-1B visas for highly skilled non-U.S. workers, who typically require at least a bachelor's degree and a skill in a highly specialized field,\u00a0according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. An estimated 700,000 people in the U.S. hold a H-1B visa, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The USCIS says it has already reached its applicant cap for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That means those applications would be excluded from having to pay the fee, but new applicants filing during the next fiscal year would be subject to it, Neumann explained.",
      "What are the main issues for current H-1B holders?",
      "According to the White House, the proclamation \"does not prevent any holder of a current H-1B visa from traveling in and out of the United States.\"",
      "H-1B visas are valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years. A White House official said the one-time $100,000 fee is only charged when applying for a visa for the first time \u2014 the payment is not required for current visa holders or those renewing the document, and those fees aren't changing.",
      "Yet the new rules leave some gray areas for current H-1B holders, Neumann said. For instance, the new fee is targeted at new visa applicants residing outside the U.S. That raises questions about whether current H-1B visa holders who are applying for changes, such as a visa renewal or a change of employer, might be caught up in the new requirement if they leave the U.S., Neumann and other immigration attorneys said.",
      "\"Where the question comes in is, what if after September 21 they file that extension and then they need to travel \u2014 are they going to be expected to pay that in order to get back into the U.S.?\" she said. \"That's kind of an open question right now.\"",
      "Although the White House said the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and won't impact their travel, Neumann said she believes more guidance is needed because the White House's Sept. 21 FAQ notes the fee applies to \"any other H-1B petitions submitted after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025.\"",
      "\"This makes it sound like it could apply to an employee who travels with any petition filed after September 21, 2025. Although it seems clear that it does not apply to individuals currently in the United States, it is not clear how it impacts those who later travel and have a petition filed after the relevant date,\" she said.",
      "For now, Neumann said she is advising her corporate clients to direct their H-1B employees not to leave the U.S.. That was echoed by Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and an immigration attorney.",
      "\"Until we have more clarification, which hopefully we'll have soon, we're telling people to just sit tight and not travel,\" Joseph said.",
      "Asked about the issue of H-1B holders who are applying for a change and who travel outside the U.S., the White House said the one-time $100,000 fee doesn't apply to renewals or current visa holders.",
      "How does the new fee impact the H-1B program?",
      "The $100,000 fee is likely to have a \"chilling effect\" on skilled foreign workers moving to the U.S.,\u00a0Joseph of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said.",
      "Although the tech industry has long been the biggest beneficiary of the H-1B program, the visa is designed for highly skilled workers across many industries, he added. Employers who rely on the visa include those in health care, which often recruit medical professionals outside the U.S. in areas where they have shortages, he said.",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders come from a range of countries, including Canada, South Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a 2022 USCIS\u00a0report.",
      "What about the national security exemption?",
      "A provision in Mr. Trump's proclamation exempts some workers, companies and even entire industries from the new $100,000 fee if they are deemed to support the \"national interest\" and are adjudged not to pose a threat to the security or welfare of the U.S.",
      "For now, however, it's unclear how to receive such an exemption, including which federal agency will be charged with approving them, Neumann said.",
      "\"There's no guidance out there yet,\" she said. \"What are the national interest exemptions going to be? How would a company apply for that, if they can get the entire company to get the exemption? How would the individual apply?\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to questions about how the national security exemption would be applied or which agency will be handling the issue.",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 17:12:12 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok includes new stipulations over who controls the social media company's algorithm, a closely guarded secret which has proved to be a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "In the meantime, a senior White House official said Monday that the U.S. and China had reached agreement on the basic details of the app's ownership. The new structure will move TikTok's U.S. operations under a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S. that will control the algorithm and oversee security, the official said.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will control the TikTok algorithm?",
      "According to the White House official, the new arrangement will operate and control a copy of the algorithm. Software maker Oracle will \"provide sort of top to bottom security\" throughout the company, the official said, noting that will involve monitoring the technology as well as managing how American data is stored.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the White House official said.",
      "Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "Mr. Trump, asked last week about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. Last week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, last week told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "Asked about this structure last week, Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, told CBS MoneyWatch that as she understands it, ByteDance would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use the algorithm under certain terms.",
      "\"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it,\" she said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch before details of the new structure were announced.",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, said the new arrangement has to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",

      "Ryan Routh declined to testify Monday while on trial for allegedly attempting to assassinate President Trump at his Florida golf club last year.",
      "Routh \u2014 who is representing himself \u2014 rested his case after questioning three witnesses earlier Monday: a firearms expert and two character witnesses. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon asked if Routh wanted to testify himself, and he said no. Closing arguments are slated for Tuesday, and jurors will deliberate after that.",
      "Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations. It was the second assassination attempt against Mr. Trump during last year's campaign, following a shooting at a rally in Pennsylvania in July 2024 in which a bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Trump before aiming a rifle through shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on September 2024, at his golf club in West Palm Beach. A Secret Service agent testified last week that he spotted Routh before the then-presidential candidate came into view. Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot, the agent said.",
      "Under questioning from Routh on Monday, firearms expert Michael McClay\u2014 a former Marine sniper and former Honolulu police officer \u2014 testified that Routh would have been able to have a view of the sixth green of the golf course, where he was allegedly hiding in the bushes. McClay testified that he had also tested Routh's firearm for the trial, and a court permitted him to fire two shots as part of the test. However, McClay said that the second shot attempt jammed during the test, suggesting that Routh would have been unable to get off multiple shots.",
      "McClay also testified that a scope found at the scene had been mounted to the firearm by tape and glue, which likely would have made it ineffective.",
      "During cross-examination, federal prosecutors made the point that investigators would have used corrosive acid to retrieve the gun's serial number, and nobody performed maintenance on the gun for months after that, so the metal may have rusted, causing it to operate less effectively.",
      "The two character witnesses, a former employee and a friend of Routh's son, testified that Routh was a peaceful man, but they conceded under cross examination that they hadn't seen the suspect in years. Routh questioned his son's friend for about 10 minutes, but the judge shut it down after Routh asked, \"would you be willing to go to Taiwan with me and host a music festival?\" Both character witnesses were cross-examined by prosecutors.",
      "Prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida rested their case Friday afternoon after spending seven days questioning 38 witnesses in an attempt to make sure Routh spends the rest of his life in prison.",
      "Cannon signed off on Routh's request to represent himself following two hearings in July. Routh told the judge that his court-appointed federal public defenders were diligent, but they didn't listen to him and were afraid of him.",
      "\"How are they supposed to represent me and say I'm not a dangerous person when they don't believe that?\" Routh said in July.",
      "The Supreme Court has held that criminal defendants have a right to represent themselves in court proceedings, as long as they can show a judge they are competent to waive their right to be defended by an attorney. Routh's former defense attorneys have served as standby counsel since Routh took over his own defense and have been present during trial the past two weeks.",
      "Cannon said attorneys should be prepared to deliver their closing arguments Tuesday, giving each side one hour and 45 minutes. Cannon had initially blocked off more than three weeks for the trial at the Fort Pierce federal courthouse, but Routh's relatively short cross-examinations and defense presentation have led to a quicker pace than anticipated.",
      "Routh was a North Carolina construction worker who in recent years had moved to Hawaii. A self-styled mercenary leader, Routh spoke out to anyone who would listen about his dangerous, sometimes violent plans to insert himself into conflicts around the world, witnesses have told The Associated Press.",
      "In the early days of the war in Ukraine, Routh tried to recruit soldiers from Afghanistan, Moldova and Taiwan to fight the Russians. In his native Greensboro, North Carolina, he was arrested in 2002 for eluding a traffic stop and barricading himself from officers with a fully automatic machine gun and a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" which turned out to be an explosive with a 10-inch (25-centimeter) fuse, police said.",
      "In 2010, police searched a warehouse Routh owned and found more than 100 stolen items, from power tools and building supplies to kayaks and spa tubs. In both felony cases, judges gave Routh either probation or a suspended sentence.",
      "In addition to the federal charges, Routh also has pleaded not guilty to state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.",
      "Two other people were accused of selling Routh the rifle he allegedly brought to Mr. Trump's golf course, though both told law enforcement they did not have any advance knowledge of Routh's alleged plans.",
      "One of those defendants has pleaded guilty to firearm trafficking, and the other pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered firearm after police found a short-barreled shotgun in his storage building.",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 16:23:56 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump moved to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her position as a member of the Federal Trade Commission in March.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will decide whether President Trump can fire members of the Federal Trade Commission without cause, taking up a dispute that tests the president's removal power and could weaken protections enacted by Congress that aim to insulate independent agencies from political pressure.",
      "The high court said in a brief order that it will also allow Mr. Trump to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her position at the FTC while it considers the case. It will hear arguments in its December session, and its stay will remain in place until it issues a decision. Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the majority's decision to allow Slaughter's removal.",
      "The justices will consider whether removal protections for members of the FTC violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether its 1935 decision that allowed Congress to impose removal protections for officials at independent agencies should be overturned. It will also weigh whether a federal court can prevent a person's removal from public office, as U.S. district courts have been doing in challenges stemming from Mr. Trump's firings of Democratic appointees.",
      "In her dissent, Kagan wrote that the Supreme Court has \"handed full control\" of certain independent agencies that Congress has sought to shield from political pressure to the president.",
      "\"He may now remove \u2014 so says the majority, though Congress said differently \u2014 any member he wishes, for any reason or no reason at all. And he may thereby extinguish the agencies' bipartisanship and independence,\" she said.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi cheered the Supreme Court's decision as a \"significant\" victory that she said protects the president's executive authority.",
      "\"This helps affirm our argument that the President, not a lower court judge, has hiring and firing power over executive officials,\" Bondi wrote on social media. \"We will continue fighting and winning in court to defend President Trump's agenda.\"",
      "The dispute arose out of Mr. Trump's move to oust Slaughter from her position on the FTC. A lower court found that the president's attempt to fire Slaughter violated a 1914 law that limits the grounds for removing an FTC commissioner to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, and ordered her to be reinstated. Earlier this month, Chief Justice John Roberts had\u00a0temporarily paused that lower court order blocking Slaughter's firing while the Supreme Court considered whether to grant the Trump administration emergency relief.",
      "In its emergency appeal to the high court, the Trump administration urged the justices to swiftly evaluate the constitutionality of the removal restrictions for the FTC before the appeals court has weighed in. Lawyers for Slaughter agreed that the question of whether the protections violate the separation of powers is ripe for the Supreme Court's consideration.",
      "The case is the latest in a string of emergency appeals that arrived before the Supreme Court in response to Mr. Trump's efforts to fire Democratic-appointed members of independent agencies at will. The conservative justices have endorsed the president's removal authority so far, clearing the way for Mr. Trump to fire without cause members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission despite federal laws protecting them from being removed at will.",
      "Those decisions have called into question the future of the 90-year-old precedent that upheld removal protections enacted by Congress for members of the FTC, the same body on which Slaughter served. In its 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the Supreme Court said Congress could shield certain officials from being removed by the president without cause.",
      "Lower courts have relied on Humphrey's Executor as grounds for reinstating officials whom Mr. Trump has attempted to fire. But the steady stream of those decisions prompted calls for the Supreme Court to definitively decide whether the president has the authority to fire the leaders of independent agencies that Congress has insulated from political shifts.",
      "In a concurring opinion in a case involving the removal of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Committee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh warned that \"the downsides of delay in definitively resolving the status of the precedent sometimes tend to outweigh the benefits of further lower-court consideration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump appointed Slaughter to the FTC in 2018, and former President Joe Biden reappointed her to a second term expiring in 2029.",
      "But in March, Mr. Trump moved to oust Slaughter from her position at the FTC. Slaughter, however, sued, arguing that her firing was illegal because federal law limits a commissioner's removal to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "Lower courts ruled in Slaughter's favor and ordered her to be reinstated to her position. The Trump administration then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "In court filings, lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the modern FTC exercises \"vast executive authority,\" a change from the 1935-era commission. The Supreme Court in Humphrey's Executor said Congress could insulate members of independent agencies from being removed without cause if that entity met certain criteria, including performing only quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the FTC wields \"substantial executive authority,\" like the other agencies whose members the president has been allowed to remove.",
      "\"[D]istrict courts cannot compel reinstatement of agency heads and allow them to purport to exercise executive power when the President has determined they should exercise none,\" he wrote.",
      "But lawyers for Slaughter said that for the past 90 years, every president, including Mr. Trump during his first term, has respected the Supreme Court's finding that the for-cause removal requirement for the FTC is valid under the Constitution.",
      "\"The protracted and unanimous acquiescence of all three branches of government in the law at issue here \u2014 a law that affirmatively empowers the President to remove commissioners for good cause \u2014 defeats Applicants' assertion that their continued adherence to that still-binding precedent while their appeal is pending would cause them irreparable harm,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "Slaughter's legal team warned that if she could be fired by the president without cause, the FTC would be \"severely wounded and radically transformed.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's 90-year-old precedent provided a narrow exception to the president's removal authority. But the high court has in recent years chipped away at that ruling.",
      "In 2020, the Supreme Court found that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance, was unconstitutional. Then, the following year, it ruled that the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Agency violates the separation of powers because it is led by a single director who could be removed by the president only for cause.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lindsey Halligan, one of President Trump's former defense lawyers who then joined him in the White House, took over a key federal prosecutor's office in Virginia on Monday following the departure of the U.S. attorney amid apparent pressure from the president.",
      "Halligan takes the helm of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia as interim U.S. attorney after serving as a senior aide to Mr. Trump. Her temporary appointment comes days after Erik Siebert, who had been serving as the top prosecutor in the office, resigned amid concerns he would be forced out for failing to prosecute New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged mortgage fraud. The president said he fired Siebert.",
      "Federal law allows Halligan to serve as interim U.S. attorney for only 120 days, unless federal judges on the U.S. district court in the region extend her appointment or she is confirmed by the Senate. The district court in the Eastern District of Virginia is known as the \"rocket docket\" because of how quickly cases move from filing to trial. It handles significant national security cases in part due to its proximity to Washington, D.C.",
      "In her role in the second Trump administration, Halligan was part of an effort by the White House to remove \"improper ideology\" from the Smithsonian Institution and its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.",
      "Halligan, who worked as a special assistant to the president, signed a letter to Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch last month informing him that the White House would be conducting an internal review of Smithsonian museums and exhibits \"to ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\"",
      "Before joining the White House and working for Mr. Trump, Halligan handled insurance claims at a law firm in Florida. She graduated from the University of Miami Law School in 2013 and was admitted to the Florida Bar in 2014. Halligan has never worked in a prosecutor's office. A legal marketing website with Halligan's resume, USattorneys.com, says that she interned at the Miami Public Defender's Office and the Innocence Project.",
      "She was a member of Mr. Trump's defense team in a case brought by former special counsel Jack Smith related to the president's alleged mishandling of classified documents after the end of his first term. The president was charged with 40 federal counts after investigators discovered roughly 300 sensitive documents at his South Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty, and the case was dismissed last November after he won a second term in the White House.",
      "Mr. Trump announced Saturday that he would be nominating Halligan for U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, writing on social media that she is \"fair, smart and will provide desperately needed, JUSTICE FOR ALL!\"",
      "The president had also publicly expressed frustration to Attorney General Pam Bondi for prosecutors' lack of action against James, Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and former FBI Director James Comey, some of the president's most vocal critics.",
      "\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!) OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "The turmoil among the top ranks of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Virginia came after Siebert, who served as the top prosecutor since January, told staff Friday he had resigned. Multiple sources told CBS News that federal prosecutors were concerned Siebert could be removed for failing to prosecute James for mortgage fraud.",
      "The federal judges in the Eastern District of Virginia had agreed in May to extend Siebert's appointment.",
      "But Mr. Trump had expressed his displeasure with Siebert, saying Friday, \"I want him out.\" The president had nominated Siebert in May to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, and his nomination was awaiting a vote by the full Senate.",
      "The president criticized Siebert because he had the support of Virginia's two Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner. A U.S. attorney nominee requires the backing of the two senators who represent the state to advance through the Senate Judiciary Committee. It seems unlikely Kaine and Warner would support Halligan's nomination.",
      "Over the weekend, a conservative lawyer, Margaret \"Maggie\" Cleary, separately told staff in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia that she had been named its top prosecutor in an acting capacity. CBS News has reached out to the White House and Justice Department for clarification.",
      "As of midday Monday, both Cleary's name and Siebert's name had appeared on separate court filings.",

      "Amazon faces a court hearing in Seattle this week to face allegations by federal regulators that the e-commerce giant duped customers into signing up for its Prime membership while also making it difficult for them to cancel their subscriptions.",
      "The case, announced\u00a0by the Federal Trade Commission in 2023, centers on claims that Amazon engaged in what the agency said amounted to a \"years-long effort\" to trick millions of customers into automatically renewing their Prime subscriptions, specifically by using user-interface designs that were \"manipulative, coercive or deceptive.\"",

      "The structure would move TikTok U.S. operations into a new \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, a senior White House official told reporters on the condition of anonymity. Software maker Oracle would serve as the security provider for U.S. operations, the senior White House official said, providing \"top to bottom\" security, including security of the algorithm. Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman & CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",

Congress may still need to sign off on any finalized TikTok deal.",
      "A possible sticking point in the plan to transfer TikTok's ownership to U.S. parties is the question of who would control TikTok's algorithm, the complex and powerful software code that has driven the app's rapid growth around the world. Some policy experts think allowing ByteDance personnel to retain access to all or part of the algorithm could expose U.S. users of the platform to risk.",

      "The advisory panel\u00a0also recommended\u00a0last week that the chicken pox vaccine be separated from the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine for children under 4 years old, rather than them being given together as a single vaccine, which is currently an option for parents who prefer to reduce the number of shots their child receives.",
      "The panel's recommendations must be approved by the CDC director to take effect.",
      "State-level changes",
      "Amid the changes at the federal level, some states are making their own adjustments. Many states are now disregarding CDC recommendations.",
      "Seven states led by Democrats in the Northeast formed a coalition, and four other states make up a new West Coast health alliance. Both groups are encouraging widespread vaccinations.",
      "Meanwhile, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo said the state plans to roll back vaccine mandates altogether.",
      "Butler said \"you've got to expect\" more sick children as a result.",
      "That's what concerns mom Marcella Farah, whose 2-year-old is up to date with her vaccines and was getting a flu shot recently.",
      "\"It's a little dangerous to not get vaccines,\" she said.",
      "Asked what she's heard from other parents, Farah said, \"Everybody's a little bit more confused, but I think a lot of people are still very strong in their own beliefs.\"",
      "Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said he expects confusion around the COVID vaccine due to the panel's vote.",
      "\"What I think it means is that people are going to be uncertain whether or not the COVID-19 vaccine is a benefit to them,\" he told CBS News on Friday. \"I think it would have been much better to make a very pointed recommendation for those in high-risk groups to get the vaccine, and for those in low-risk groups, that's where individual decision-making makes sense.\"",
      "Amid the confusion, data from the CDC shows vaccination rates among kindergartners during the 2024-2025 school year decreased for all reported vaccines from the year before.",

      "Despite being declared blind at 8 years old, Lakrout has taken on challenges, such as running the New York City Marathon and joining the U.S. National Paraclimbing Team. A new piece of technology \u2014 Meta's AI glasses \u2014 is her latest tool to help her stay savvy and adaptable on a daily basis.",
      "\"The glasses make my life easier,\" said the 27 year old. \"They make things faster and they make me able to do more in the day because it's just quicker and easier to do things and I feel less tired at the end of the day.\"",
      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",
      "Members of the blind community have found new ways to use the technology.",
      "Users are able to connect their glasses to the \"Be My Eyes\" app which connects blind and visually impaired users with volunteers to assist with recognizing objects and managing everyday tasks in real time. Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail. For Lakrout, having access to text-based information like signs in a subway station or on street corners is what makes AI technology useful. She says Meta's AI glasses are bringing blind communities one step closer to accessing this information.",

      "\"(They) work well for some things, doesn't work well in other situations,\" he said.",
      "Lakrout discovered this for herself. When she tried the glasses on in a restaurant, they read the menu to her perfectly but couldn't tell her the price for a specific item on second prompt. When using some of the AI-powered features, the glasses' battery died, and so she regularly had to keep them in their case to charge.",
      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence. But in the end, the glasses do not \"replace the need for human capacity,\" Riccobo said. \"So we need to teach blind people and we still need to make sure that blind people develop the skills that blind people need to be successful.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 11:01:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. raise concerns about autism and the use of Tylenol by pregnant women, here's what medical research shows.",
    "story": [
      "Recent reports in the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0and\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0say President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are expected to announce that the use of Tylenol by pregnant women may be linked to autism in children. But many top medical experts in the field say the evidence does not support that.",
      "This comes after Kennedy said in April that HHS would undertake a \"massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism. Kennedy at the time said the plan was to release a comprehensive report in September. However, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said later that month the findings could take up to a year.",
      "Kennedy has in the past made the unfounded claim that autism is a \"preventable disease,\" drawing heavy criticism from many medical experts, who say evidence shows there are multiple factors, including genetics, that play a role.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News on Sept. 5, an HHS spokesperson said, \"We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America's unprecedented rise in autism rates. Until we release the final report, any claims about its contents are nothing more than speculation.\"",
      "What does Tylenol maker Kenvue say about autism?",
      "In response to the WSJ story on Sept. 5, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol \u2014 whose active ingredient is acetaminophen \u2014 said: \"We have continuously evaluated the science and continue to believe there is no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and leading medical organizations agree on the safety of acetaminophen, its use during pregnancy, and the information provided on the label.\"",
      "Kenvue added, \"We appreciate the Secretary acknowledging media coverage on the upcoming HHS report is 'nothing more than speculation.'\"",
      "In another statement on Sept. 21, the company said:",
      "\"We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.",
      "Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.",
      "The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism. We stand with the many public health and medical professionals who have reviewed this science and agree. We will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.\"",
      "What do medical experts say?",
      "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement provided to CBS News that \"there is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"",
      "\"Neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular, are multifactorial and very difficult to associate with a singular cause,\" ACOG said. \"Pregnant patients should not be frightened away from the many benefits of acetaminophen, which is safe and one of the few options pregnant people have for pain relief.\"",
      "Dr. Christopher Zahn, ACOG's chief of clinical practice, said, \"Pregnant patients should not be frightened away from the many benefits of acetaminophen, which is safe and one of the few options pregnant people have for pain relief.\"",
      "\"If you have a high fever during pregnancy, that can cause neurodevelopment issues in the baby, so you don't want to let that fever go untreated,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Goudner, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. She said pregnant women should talk with their OB-GYN, especially if they're needing it frequently, and use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time.",
      "While some research suggested there could be a possible association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, those studies involved relatively small groups and did not prove a link. Larger and more robust studies have\u00a0found no connection\u00a0between acetaminophen and autism.",
      "\"I spoke this afternoon to a researcher who was part of a\u00a0major study\u00a0published just last year that followed 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said after the WSJ report came out. \"He said use of acetaminophen ... was not associated with an increased risk of autism in children.\"",
      "LaPook said he is looking forward to reading the upcoming report pledged by Kennedy, \"especially the evidence behind any conclusions and recommendations.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to\u00a0statistics compiled\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why.",
      "Research shows the causes of autism \"are complex,\" Dr. Christine Ladd-Acosta, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the vice director for the Wendy Klag Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities, told CBS News in an interview.",
      "\"There have been a few dozen studies looking at Tylenol and whether use during pregnancy is associated with risk of autism in those women's children, and the evidence has been really kind of conflicting,\" Ladd-Acosta said. \"Some studies have shown no association. Some have shown a positive association. Some have shown negative associations. And I think part of that is because it's really hard to tease apart ... whether it's the medication itself that is influencing autism risk in the child, or if it has to do with the condition ... the mother is using the medicine to treat that is the thing that is important in autism risk.\"",
      "Ladd-Acosta noted that the dosage, the length of time that pregnant women take Tylenol, and the \"specific condition\" they are taking it for are all factors that have been considered when attempting to determine if there is a potential association between the medication and autism.",
      "\"There have been some associations, but there has been no conclusive evidence I've seen to show that Tylenol itself causes autism definitively,\" Ladd-Acosta said.",

    "summary": "Trump administration figures have vowed to pursue anyone who mocks or celebrates Kirk's death, alarming First Amendment advocates.",
    "story": [
      "In the week since conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated at a Utah university event, comments from some of his critics have ignited a battle over free speech in an increasingly polarized nation.",
      "Kirk, who routinely debated progressive students at his Turning Point USA events and espoused controversial opinions on his podcast, was a stalwart proponent of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Hate speech does not exist legally in America,\" he wrote on X last year. \"There's ugly speech. There's gross speech. There's evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment.\"",
      "But over the last several days, the administration he supported and the president he helped reelect have vowed to crack down on some speech about his death.",
      "Last week, Pentagon officials promised to \"address\" federal employees who mock or celebrate Kirk's death. On Monday, the State Department said it will revoke visas\u00a0over social posts that \"celebrate\" Kirk's death.",
      "That same day, Vice President JD Vance hosted Kirk's podcast and encouraged listeners to call the employers of anyone \"celebrating Charlie's murder.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday said people who post \"hate speech\" should be \"shut down\" and suggested that the Trump administration would pursue people who engage in hate speech.",
      "\"There's free speech, and then there's hate speech,\" Bondi said in an\u00a0interview. \"We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.\" The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld free speech rights, even if it is hate speech. She later said on X that \"hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected.\" The Justice Department referred CBS News to Bondi's comments when asked whether the administration considers celebrations of Kirk's assassination as threats of violence.",
      "\"Democrat critics are lying about the Administration's actions \u2014 this effort will target those committing criminal acts and hold them accountable,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Asked about Bondi's remarks, President Trump told ABC News' Jonathan Karl on Tuesday: \"We'll probably go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly; it's hate.\"",
      "Kimmel \"indefinitely\" taken off air",
      "Late Wednesday, ABC announced it would \"indefinitely\" pre-empt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr said the network should \"take action\" for the comedian's suggestion that Kirk's alleged killer is a Trump supporter. ABC's move came after station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they were pulling the show indefinitely. Carr thanked Nexstar and Sinclair for taking action.",
      "Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the FCC to approve it. Nexstar told CBS News in a statement it made the decision to pre-empt Kimmel \"unilaterally\" and did not consult with the FCC beforehand.",
      "On Truth Social, Mr. Trump referred to it as a cancellation and congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\" and added: \"That leaves Jimmy [Fallon] and Seth [Meyers], two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!\"",
      "Anna Gomez, one of two FCC commissioners working with Carr and the lone Democrat on the commission, called Kimmel's penalty a dangerous new precedent.",
      "\"This administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression, not because it glorifies violence or breaks the law, but because it challenges those in power and reflects views they oppose,\" she said on CNN Wednesday.",
      "In a statement on Thursday, she added: \"This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes. \u2026 Free speech is the foundation of our democracy, and we must push back against any attempt to erode it.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, also criticized the move.",
      "\"When the head of the FCC is talking openly about taking away the broadcast license, then that is the government trying to exercise censorship. It's not a question of whether you agree with Mr. Kimmel or disagree with Mr. Kimmel. The point is one of the government not coming in and making decisions about whose speech gets heard,\" she said, adding, \"Everyone should care, no matter what your political view is.\"",
      "After a week of controversy, Disney said Kimmel's show will return on Tuesday, Sept. 23. The company said some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive,\" but after several days of \"thoughtful conversations with Jimmy ... we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.\"",
      "The First Amendment and hateful speech",
      "In general, the First Amendment \u2014 which bars the government from \"abridging the freedom of speech\" \u2014 protects most forms of hateful speech, aside from a narrow set of exceptions that include threats of violence and incitement.",
      "Bondi's initial comments about hate speech stood out among those made by administration officials because of her position as the nation's top prosecutor, said Adam Goldstein, vice president of strategic initiatives at the nonprofit Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.",
      "\"I especially don't want to see an attorney in charge of the Justice Department saying that,\" he said. \"It's the kind of thing that would get you a bad grade in your constitutional law class.\"",
      "Jenin Younes, a First Amendment attorney who worked on a case accusing the Biden administration of social media censorship, told CBS News, \"These are all the same people who were railing against cancel culture and the idea of hate speech just a few years ago, when it was the left doing it.\"",
      "\"The worry is that lawmakers will just define hate speech to mean anything the opposite party says, and so that's why the court has said it's not up to the government to decide what's within the bounds of acceptable discourse and what's not,\" Genevieve Lakier, a University of Chicago law professor, told CBS News. \"There's no definition of hate speech, because the whole point is there's no neutral definition of hate speech.\"",
      "In most cases, Lakier said, \"simply saying 'he had it coming' \u2026 does not fit the very, very, very narrow definition of incitement that is available in the case law.\"",
      "Are offensive comments illegal?",
      "First Amendment legal scholar Eugene Volokh told CBS News that, in most circumstances, the government cannot go after ordinary people for making insensitive or offensive public comments about Kirk's killing.",
      "\"It may be in bad taste. It may be bad for the country when people are trying to normalize political violence. But it is protected by the First Amendment,\" said Volokh, a professor emeritus of law at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\"I would say it's basically prohibited for the government to say you can't mock or make fun of or even celebrate his death,\" said Younes, who currently serves as national legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.",
      "Volokh says comments like Bondi's \"are likely to further confuse people, whether citizens or law enforcement or others, about what's protected and what's not protected.\"",
      "\"I think they may also kind of send a message that we are going to try to find a way of punishing this speech,\" Volokh added.",
      "Bondi also said Monday the Justice Department could prosecute businesses that refuse to print photos of Kirk for customers, citing a worker at an Office Depot who declined to print flyers for a Kirk vigil. Office Depot called the incident \"completely unacceptable\" and said the staff member no longer works for the company.",
      "\"There is no federal law that prohibits copy shops or print shops from discriminating based on the content of the message,\" Volokh said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Bondi was solely referencing the Office Depot incident, which the department's civil rights division looked into.",
      "Less clear, according to legal experts, is whether the federal government can deport non-citizens or revoke their visas over their views on Kirk, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio has floated. Volokh says the laws around this are \"unsettled.\"",
      "\"While it is true that the executive's power when it comes to immigration is very vast, I think the First Amendment constrains it,\" Younes said. She pointed to the Trump administration's attempts to remove students for participating in pro-Palestinian protests, which have been met with pushback at the district court level.",
      "What can private companies do?",
      "The First Amendment doesn't stop private employers from choosing to fire people for speech, though some states like California have their own legal protections.",
      "However, in some cases, it can be illegal for the government to use its power to pressure a private company into firing a staff member \u2014 a concept known as \"jawboning.\"",
      "Government officials can try to persuade private companies to take a certain action, according to Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, but they cannot coerce companies by making threats.",
      "Volokh said it likely doesn't qualify as jawboning if elected officials merely express the view that people should be fired, as long as they don't cross the line into threatening to take action. For example, on Vance's call for people to contact the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's death, Volokh said, \"it's hard to see that as unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"You would have to show the private employer didn't want to fire you, but they were just acting because they were afraid of some kind of repercussions from the government,\" noted Younes.",
      "There's a fine line between broadly encouraging companies to fire employees who praised Kirk's assassination, and giving instructions to specific firms, according to Goldstein. He pointed to a contrast between Vance's comments advising podcasts listeners to call people's employers, and a tweet by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.",
      "Duffy praised American Airlines, United and Delta for suspending employees, and wrote, \"The next step should be to fire them.\"",
      "\"A rational airline who sees this message might feel some coercive effect on their decision making,\" said Goldstein, noting Duffy's power over the airline industry.",
      "Lakier said it's not a violation of the First Amendment if a company fires an employee of their own volition. But, she said, \"the problem is, in many of these cases, it's going to be because of political sympathy.\"",
      "\"The employers who are firing them, maybe implicitly fear that if they don't, they're going to face the government's wrath or they want to curry favor by firing,\" she said.",
      "In general, however, \"If we're talking about private companies and you are an at-will employee, then that means exactly as it sounds like, which is that an employer can fire you at will,\" said CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School.",
      "Government workers have some free speech protections, but it's complicated",
      "In many cases, Trump allies have spotlighted public employees who criticize Kirk.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called celebrations of Kirk's death by service members or civilian workers \"unacceptable\" last week, and said the Pentagon is \"tracking\" them. Since then, at least one Marine officer has been relieved of his recruiting duties pending an investigation into his post about Kirk, and two Army officers have been suspended pending a review into their posts, according to a Marine official and an Army official.",
      "A Secret Service agent who expressed negative opinions about Kirk on Facebook was also placed on leave last week.",
      "At the state level, Oklahoma's top education official has said teachers who celebrate Kirk's assassination \"will be banned from teaching,\" and teachers in several other states have been investigated or placed on leave over their comments. Others have pushed for action against employees at public colleges like Clemson University.",
      "People who work for the government have some free speech protections, especially for speech that they make while off the clock, legal experts say.",
      "\"Government employees do have First Amendment rights of freedom of speech,\" said Calvert. \"However, those rights are not unlimited and may be restricted if the employee's speech somehow interferes with the ability of the employer \u2026 to effectively and efficiently deliver its services to the public.\"",
      "Calvert said \"every case is going to be unique.\"",
      "Prior court rulings have established several factors for assessing the speech rights of government employees, according to Calvert and Volokh. Those include whether the worker spoke in their personal capacity, whether it relates to a matter of public concern and whether the worker's right to speak out outweighs the government's interest in delivering its services.",
      "But the military is a slightly separate case, according to Volokh, because \"there are more restrictions that are permissible on service members' speech.\"",
      "Volokh said the military is different \"in part because of a sense that \u2026 this is an environment where discipline is really important, where self-discipline is really important, where unit cohesion is really important, where commitment to the right ideas is very important.\"",
      "\"It's going very, very far\"",
      "Some First Amendment advocates are uncomfortable with vocal calls for people to be fired \u2014 even if they don't run afoul of the Constitution.",
      "\"It's going very, very far. This is not being limited to people saying, 'I'm glad Charlie Kirk is dead and I wish everyone like him was dead, too,'\" Younes said. \"It's being applied to people who just are saying they didn't like Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "Goldstein said that some officials may be understandably lashing out after the death of their friend, but particularly in the context of Kirk's career as free speech advocate, the reaction has gone too far.",
      "\"What a weird way to react in memory of Charlie Kirk, who was known for listening to people and disagreeing with them, and moving on,\" Goldstein said.",

    "summary": "Newspapers in the U.K. published an email that Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson reportedly wrote to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "A number of charities on Monday severed ties with Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of Prince Andrew, after British newspapers published an email that she reportedly wrote to the late convicted sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein, describing him as a \"supreme friend.''",
      "Julia's House, a children's hospice, said that the reported correspondence made it inappropriate for Ferguson, also known as the Duchess of York, to remain a patron. A spokesman for Ferguson said that she sent an email on the advice of her lawyers after Epstein threatened to sue her for associating him with sexual abuse in a media interview, Britain's Press Association reported.",
      "\"Following the information shared this weekend on the Duchess of York's correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein, Julia's House has taken the decision that it would be inappropriate for her to continue as a patron of the charity,'' the charity said. \"We have advised the Duchess of York of this decision and thank her for her past support.\"",
      "A food allergy charity, The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, and Prevent Breast Cancer, were also among the charities that cut ties in light of recent revelations.",
      "\"We were disturbed to read of Sarah, Duchess of York's, correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein,\" Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, founders of the food allergy charity, said in a statement. \"Sarah Ferguson has not been actively involved with the charity for some years. She was a patron but, in the light of the recent revelations, we have taken the decision that it would be inappropriate for her to continue to be associated with the charity. We would like to thank her for her kindness and support in the past.\"",
      "The Teenage Cancer Trust, which had an association with Ferguson for 35 years, also dropped her as a patron.",
      "The email referred to a 2011\u00a0interview with the Evening Standard newspaper in which she apologized for accepting 15,000 pounds from Epstein.",
      "\"I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know that this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf. I am just so contrite I cannot say,'' Ferguson said in the interview. \"Whenever I can, I will repay the money and have nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again.\"",
      "But the following month, Ferguson sent an email to Epstein in which she \"humbly apologized\" for linking him to sex abuse, saying \"you have always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my family,\" The Sun newspaper reported over the weekend.",
      "The Associated Press couldn't independently confirm that the email is authentic.",
      "Epstein\u00a0died by suicide in 2019 while he was in custody facing federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The story comes less than a month after Andrew himself was criticized for staying in touch with Epstein for five years longer than previously claimed.",
      "Leaked email correspondence between Epstein and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak indicated that the prince had been in touch with Epstein as late as 2015, the Times of London reported. Andrew told the BBC in 2019 that he ceased all contact with Epstein in December 2010, after the late disgraced financier pleaded guilty to sex crimes in Florida.",
      "Andrew and his ex-wife have faced a series of scandals amid concerns that the prince has tried to profit from his royal status.",
      "He was forced to give up all royal duties and charity roles after the 2019 interview with the BBC in which he was criticized for trying to minimize his connections with Epstein and failing to show sympathy for his victims. Last year, it emerged that a suspected Chinese spy had developed close links with Andrew, raising concerns about efforts to put undue influence on other members of the royal family.",

      "An unknown number of inmates escaped in the clash between rival gangs, during which another 14 people were injured, a masked police officer identified as commander Colonel William Calle told the Ecuavisa channel.",
      "Thirteen inmates have been recaptured.",
      "Calle said gunfire broke out in the early morning hours, alerting prison guards and police who rushed to that part of the prison in Machala, in southwest Ecuador near the Peruvian border.",
      "One guard was killed as he entered, and others were taken hostage, said the officer.",
      "Calle said the confrontation lasted about 40 minutes, during which inmates \"fired guns, threw bombs, grenades.\"",
      "The dead inmates belonged to the rival Los Choneros and Los Lobos gangs, two of the biggest drug trafficking groups in Ecuador. Earlier this month, the\u00a0U.S. designated\u00a0both gangs as foreign terrorist organizations in the Trump administration's latest move against cartels.",
      "Police said the violence was the result of \"fighting between gangs\" in a facility housing double the number of inmates it was designed for.",
      "Calle said \"control has already been regained\" over the prison.",
      "He did not specify the fate of the hostages or how many inmates were on the run.",
      "Ecuador's prisons\u00a0are among the most dangerous in the world, and many have been taken over by drug gangs. The penitentiaries have been under military control since January 2024, when President Daniel Noboa declared a\u00a0state of \"internal armed conflict\"\u00a0after a brutal wave of violence, sparked by the jailbreak of a powerful crime boss.",
      "In September 2024, the director of Ecuador's biggest prison,\u00a0Maria Daniela Icaza, was killed in an armed attack while driving. Icaza's death came just days after the head of a prison in the Amazonian province of Sucumbios, Alex Guevara, was killed, also in an attack while traveling by car.",
      "Ecuador recorded more than 4,600 homicides in the first half of the year, a 47% increase from the same period of 2024, data from the Ecuadoran Observatory of Organized Crime shows.",

      "In July, the Ecuadoran government\u00a0extradited Mac\u00edas\u00a0to the United States, and he\u00a0pleaded not guilty.

    "story": [
      "The governments of the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia joined dozens of other nations in symbolically recognizing a Palestinian state despite vociferous opposition from the United States and Israel.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday confirmed the widely anticipated announcement, saying the move is intended \"to revive hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis.\"",
      "\"Let's be frank. Hamas is a brutal terror organization. Our call for a genuine two-state solution is the exact opposite of their hateful vision,\" Starmer said Sunday. \"So we are clear, this solution is not a reward for Hamas, because it means Hamas can have no future, no role in government, no role in security.\"",
      "It is a watershed moment for Palestinians and their decades-long ambitions for statehood.",
      "\"Canada recognizes the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the State of Palestine and the State of Israel,\" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote on social media.",
      "The prime minister of Australia, Anthony Albanese, said in a statement that the announcement alongside those from the U.K. and Canada are part of a \"co-ordinated international effort to build momentum for a two-state solution.\"",
      "\"Today's act of recognition reflects Australia's longstanding commitment to a two-state solution, which has always been the only path to enduring peace and security for the Israeli and Palestinian people,\" Albanese said in a statement.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded with an angry statement on Sunday, saying the establishment of a Palestinian state \"will not happen.\"",
      "He accused Britain and other Western allies of giving a \"reward\" to Hamas.",
      "\"I have a clear message for those leaders who recognise a Palestinian state after the horrific massacre on October 7: you are granting a huge reward to terror,\" he said. \"And I have another message for you: it will not happen. No Palestinian state will be established west of the Jordan River.\"",
      "The prime minister said he would announce Israel's response to Sunday's announcements after a trip next week to the U.S., where he is to meet with President Trump at the White House.",
      "Mr. Trump voiced his disapproval of the U.K.'s recognition of a Palestinian state during a state visit to Britain last week.",
      "\"I have a disagreement with the prime minister on that score,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Though the move is largely symbolic, it is a historic moment as the U.K. arguably laid the groundwork for the creation of the Israeli state when it was in control of what was then known as Palestine in 1917.",
      "More than 140 countries have already taken that step and more are expected to do so at the U.N. General Assembly this week, including France.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that France's decision to recognize a Palestinian state is necessary to combat Hamas.",
      "\"The objective of Hamas is absolutely not to create a Palestinian state,\" he said. \"The objective of Hamas is to destroy Israel, to convince the maximum number of people that they have no chance to have peace and stability, and precisely a Palestinian state. And to kill the maximum number of Israeli people. And this is why, if we want to stop this war, if we want to isolate Hamas, the recognition process and the peace plan which goes with this recognition process is a precondition.\"",
      "Critics, including the U.S. and the Israeli government, which has shown no interest in a two-state solution, have condemned the plans, saying it rewards Hamas for its attack on Oct. 7, 2023. As well as arguing that recognition is immoral, critics argue that it's an empty gesture given that the Palestinian people are divided into two territories \u2014 the West Bank and Gaza \u2014 with no recognized international capital.",
      "The war started on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in their attack on southern Israel. Forty-eight hostages remain in Gaza, with many released through ceasefires or other agreements. Israel believes about 20 are still alive, though the bodies of two hostages were recovered during a joint operation in late August.",
      "The Palestinian head of mission in the U.K., Husam Zomlot, told CBS News partner the BBC that recognition would right a colonial-era wrong.",
      "\"The issue today is ending the denial of our existence that started 108 years ago, in 1917,\" he said. \"And I think today, the British people should celebrate a day when history is being corrected, when wrongs are being righted, when recognition of the wrongs of the past are beginning to be corrected.\""

The fact that it is openly lying to the whole world about it is another.\"",
      "Underlying all of the Ukrainian president's efforts during his visit to the U.S. for the United Nations assembly this week, will be a push for his partners to implement further sanctions aimed at punishing the Russian economy, particularly around oil and energy trade, which Mr. Trump has hinted he is willing to do.",
      "Speaking during a state visit to the U.K. last week, Mr. Trump lamented his inability to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine since he took office in January, noting that he thought it would be easier to achieve.

    "story": [
      "The Taliban government on Sunday rejected U.S. President Trump's bid to retake Bagram Air Base, four years after America's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan left the sprawling military facility in the Taliban's hands.",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday renewed his call to reestablish a U.S. presence at Bagram, even saying \"we're talking now to Afghanistan\" about the matter. He did not offer further details about the purported conversations. Asked by a reporter if he'd consider deploying U.S. troops to take the base, the president demurred.",
      "\"We won't talk about that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We want it back, and we want it back right away. If they don't do it, you're going to find out what I'm going to do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump followed up with a social media post saying \"If Afghanistan doesn't give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!\"",
      "On Sunday, chief Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected Mr. Trump's assertions and urged the U.S. to adopt a policy of \"realism and rationality.\"",
      "Afghanistan had an economy-oriented foreign policy and sought constructive relations with all states on the basis of mutual and shared interests, Mujahid posted on X.",
      "It had been consistently communicated to the U.S. in all bilateral negotiations that Afghanistan's independence and territorial integrity were of the utmost importance, he said.",
      "\"It should be recalled that, under the Doha Agreement, the United States pledged that 'it will not use or threaten force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Afghanistan, nor interfere in its internal affairs,'\" he said. The U.S. needed to remain faithful to its commitments, he added.",
      "Mujahid did not reply to questions from The Associated Press about conversations with the Trump administration regarding Bagram and why Mr. Trump believed the U.S. could retake it.",
      "'Ceding Afghan soil is out of the question'",
      "Earlier Sunday, the chief of staff at the Defense Ministry, Fasihuddin Fitrat, addressed Mr. Trump's comments. \"Ceding even an inch of our soil to anyone is out of the question and impossible,\" he said during a speech broadcast by Afghan media.",
      "In August last year, the Taliban celebrated the third anniversary of their takeover at Bagram with a grand military display of abandoned U.S. hardware, catching the eye of the White House. Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized his predecessor, Joe Biden, for his \"gross incompetence\" during the withdrawal of U.S. forces after the country's longest war.",
      "Mr. Trump last week, during his state visit to the United Kingdom, hinted that the Taliban, who have struggled with an economic crisis, international legitimacy, internal rifts and rival militant groups since their return to power in 2021, could be game to allow the U.S. military to return.",
      "\"We're trying to get it back because they need things from us,\" Mr. Trump said of the Taliban. While the U.S. and the Taliban have no formal diplomatic ties, the sides have had hostage conversations. An American man who was abducted more than two years ago while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist was released by the Taliban in March.",
      "The Taliban also said they reached an agreement with U.S. envoys on an exchange of prisoners as part of an effort to normalize relations between the United States and Afghanistan.",
      "They gave no details of the detainee swap, and the White House did not comment on the meeting in Kabul or the results described in a Taliban statement. The Taliban released photographs from their talks, showing their foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, with Mr. Trump's special envoy for hostage response, Adam Boehler.",

      "Brazilians held protests in all 26 states and the Federal District on Sunday against a possible pardon for former\u00a0President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies, who were convicted of attempting a coup.",
      "Calls for demonstrations grew after the lower house on Tuesday passed a constitutional amendment that would make it harder to arrest or launch criminal proceedings against lawmakers. The measure now heads to the Senate.",
      "The following day, the lower house voted to fast-track a bill backed by right-wing opposition lawmakers that could grant amnesty to Bolsonaro, his closest allies and hundreds of supporters convicted for their roles in the January 2023 uprising.",
      "The coup plot included a plan to poison his successor and\u00a0current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u00a0and kill a Supreme Court judge.",
      "Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison on Sept. 11 for attempting to stay in power after losing a 2022 reelection bid. He is the first former president convicted of trying to overturn an election in Latin America's largest economy. Bolsonaro denied any wrongdoing.",

      "Music legends Caetano Veloso, Chico Buarque and Gilberto Gil \u2014 who defied censorship during the military dictatorship of the 1960s \u2014 reunited in Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana neighborhood to protest.",
      "\"I was outraged by the news that many deputies voted in favor of a shielding law for themselves and their colleagues,\" Veloso told Brazilian news outlet UOL in an interview published Saturday. \"This, along with a proposal for amnesty for the coup plotters. I think I identified with the majority of the Brazilian population, who do not want these things to go through.\"",

      "Dulce Oliveira, a 53-year-old teacher who attended the demonstration in Brasilia, echoed Anitta's indignation. \"This protest is important because the people need to show them what we want, because they are there to represent our needs, not their own,\" she said.",
      "Brazilian actor Wagner Moura attended the protest in Salvador, Bahia. Speaking to the crowd from the top of a truck, he said he was not willing to talk about the legislative proposals. Instead, he emphasized \"this extraordinary moment in Brazilian democracy, which serves as an example to the entire world.\"",
      "Sunday's protests were organized by artists and left-wing groups that have struggled to mobilize large crowds compared with the right. On Sept. 7, ahead of Bolsonaro's Supreme Court trial, thousands of his supporters rallied in his defense.",
      "Polls show the country remains deeply divided over Bolsonaro.",
      "A majority supports his conviction and imprisonment, but a significant share of the population still backs him. According to a Datafolha poll released Sept. 16, 50% of respondents said Bolsonaro should be jailed, while 43% disagreed and 7% declined to answer. The survey interviewed 2,005 people nationwide and had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.",

    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" the French president pushed back on criticism for recognizing a Palestinian state.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said it was out of line for Charles Kushner, the U.S. ambassador to France and the father of President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, to publicly accuse him of taking insufficient action to combat antisemitism, and for him to link France's foreign policy positions to domestic incidents of violence against Jews in France.",
      "In a letter he published in the Wall Street Journal to Macron in August, Kushner wrote that he had \"deep concern over the dramatic rise of antisemitism in France and the lack of sufficient action by your government to confront it.\"",
      "\"Public statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France,\" he wrote, urging Macron to \"enforce hate-crime laws without exception; ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, prosecute offenders to the fullest extent; and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\"",
      "In an interview with \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Thursday in Paris, Macron called Kushner's criticism a \"mistake\" and an \"unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat.\"",
      "\"This is unacceptable,\" he said.",
      "Macron said a French ambassador would never be allowed to make similar public remarks about another country because it would risk diplomacy with those nations.",
      "\"So either you are a person who wants to express freely,\" Macron said. \"If you are a diplomat, you have to follow the rule of diplomacy. \u2026 The [American] taxpayer money is not properly used to finance this kind of statement.\"",
      "France's foreign ministry summoned the ambassador last month in a formal rebuke. The French ministry said Kushner's claims \"run counter to international law,\" citing the \"obligation not to interfere in the internal affairs of states\" in the 1961 Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations.",
      "Kushner also wrote that \"anti-Zionism is antisemitism \u2014 plain and simple.\"",
      "The State Department said at the time in a statement to the Associated Press, that Kushner \"is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role.\"",
      "Macron acknowledged that at times people who criticize the state of Israel and its government may be motivated by hate of Jews, but rejected the idea that any of his criticism of the policies of the Netanyahu government is inherently anti-semitic.",
      "He told Brennan, \"I was the first president in France to adopt the definition of antisemitism, making it the equivalent of anti-Zionism.\"",
      "Macron firmly rejected the notion that his objections to the killing in Gaza or his call for the creation of a Palestinian state is inherently antisemitic or puts at risk French Jews. He argued \"it doesn't mean that you are not allowed to be in disagreement with the government of Israel.\" Disagreeing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"doesn't make me an antisemitic,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu currently leads the most right- wing government in Israeli history, opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, and has waged a nearly two- year- long war in Gaza that succeeded in killing the Hamas leaders who carried out the bloody October 7th terrorist attack that killed 1200 of his people. The war since that time has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, and his policies including a blockade of humanitarian aid has led to famine in Gaza.",
      "Hamas still operates in Gaza, and Macron said Hamas continues to be able to recruit more fighters despite Israel killing the top echelons of the terror group. The failure to eliminate support for Hamas via military force is proof, Macron argues, that support is needed for an alternate government in the form of the Palestinian Authority.",
      "Netanyahu accused Macron of fueling antisemitism after the French president announced France would recognize Palestinian statehood this Monday at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.",
      "The high-level gathering of world leaders and their representatives, and other countries, including the U.K., Australia and Canada, also plan to join France in recognizing Palestinian statehood. The majority of the world's countries - 147 UN members - recognize the right of Palestinians to self-determination but the decision by Western powers including UN Security Council member France and UK is symbolically significant. It is also a sign of the increased isolation of the current Israeli government, which has refused to end the nearly two year war in Gaza.",
      "The plan developed by France and Saudi Arabia involves several phases, including a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Hamas releasing the remaining hostages it's held since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel and the restoration of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Those conditions would have to be met before France opens an embassy there, Macron said. The second phase involves Gaza's reconstruction and governance and the third phase focuses on a two-state solution.",
      "Macron succeeded in getting Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, the 90-year-old leader who governs the Occupied West Bank, to publicly denounce Hamas and agree to reform the Authority and hold elections.",
      "\"Recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop,\" Macron said.",
      "The position puts France in direct conflict with the Trump administration, which blocked Palestinian Authority members from obtaining visas to attend the diplomatic gathering. Despite President Trump's statements that starvation is happening in Gaza and Israel should end its war there, Netanyahu has brushed off any American urging to do so. Recently Trump said he 'wasn't thrilled' with Netanyahu's decision to bomb US ally Qatar while Hamas members were meeting to discuss a US proposal to end the Gaza war.",
      "The current U.S. administration also appears to oppose the creation of a Palestinian State, with Trump supporting a proposal to remove Gazans and send them to other countries. The U.S. remains a staunch supporter of Israel, as well as its main weapons provider.",
      "Margaret Brennan is moderator of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on CBS. Based in Washington, D.C., Brennan is also the Network's chief foreign affairs correspondent and a contributing correspondent to 60 Minutes. Additionally, she appears regularly on the \"CBS Evening News,\" leading coverage from Washington when news breaks on the political and foreign affairs fronts."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Gary Cohn, IBM vice chairman and former director of the U.S. National Economic Council, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to a look at the U.S. economy. Gary Cohn was the head of the White House National Economic Council in the first Trump administration. Good morning. Great to have you back.",
      "GARY COHN: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it finally happened. The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by quarter point, which was expected. So, rates are now in this range of four to four and a quarter percent, lowest level since 2022 the President had said all of this was overdue. What changes now?",
      "GARY COHN: So, look, I think the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week. As you said, they started down the path of cutting interest rates, going to four to four and a quarter.\u00a0 They also gave us their outlook. So the 17 governors gave us their projections to where they think interest rates are going. So that plot that they put out shows that overall, they believe that interest rates will be cut two more times over the course of this year. Now it's not 100% clear, because the committee is divided. There are about seven members of the committee that do not want another cut this year, but there are 10 members of the committee that want at least two more cuts, and one wants more than two cuts. So that averages out to two cuts this year, which would take the federal funds rate, and it's important to understand the federal funds rate, would take that down to 3.6% for the- for year end. What is also important is the committee was fairly unanimous. I think people were worried about the independence of the Fed. I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers. They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a projections that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when rates go lower, money gets cheaper to borrow, essentially. But what does it actually mean?",
      "GARY COHN: Yes and no. So, what the Federal Reserve sets is they set the federal funds rate. That's the overnight rates the banks charge each other to borrow on a secured basis. It has nothing to do where- with where American consumers borrow money. Unfortunately, American consumers borrow money on more of the five year, the seven year, the ten and the thirty year rates, because that's where automobile loans, credit card loans, student loans and mortgages are indexed to those. Interest rates are not determined by the Federal Reserve. They're determined by the open market. Those rates, in fact, after they cut rates earlier this week, went up a little bit that said they are down over the last few months. But those rates do not automatically go down when the Federal Reserve cuts rates. They have more to do with the market, and it's a supply demand situation that determines those rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the other things the Fed highlighted here is that the labor market is, quote, \"really cooling off.\" That's what Fed Chair Powell says.",
      "GARY COHN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The administration, the Treasury secretary, says, data's bad. They're not seeing that in the jobs numbers. So which is it? What's happening here?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, look, the chairman went out of his way to talk about the dual mandate that the Fed has. The Fed has two requirements that they're supposed to run interest rate policy off of, one is called stable prices, which means 2% inflation. The other is full employment. Full employment is exactly what it sounds like. The Chair said, look, we are going to have to deal with the full employment part of the equation, even though we still have inflation in the system. So, the Federal Reserve itself and the Board of Governors admitted that we are having a declining job market, and we see that, the data over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month. It may be temporary, it may be quite temporary, but the reality is, we have seen the job market degrade. We've also seen companies announce an enormous amount of CapEx and capital expenditures that's going to come into the system. I think it's interesting to take a step back and look at what's going on in the world today. I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have. You know, when you take companies and you put them in a very difficult environment and you increase the cost of input costs. And inputs have been going up because of tariffs. They've been going up be- other reasons, and they're not able to raise prices to the final consumer. The one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is they can cut down on the cost of labor. We came out of a tough situation in COVID where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people, so they were hoarding labor. So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses, and the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor. So they're letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system, and we're seeing that in the data, and I think it's clearly showing up.And the Federal Reserve. Recognize that in this in this week's action,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you ask the administration about this point, let's say, well, productivity is going to increase, and there are these technological shifts that are happening. So this data is distorted. Are you-, speaking specifically about tech, or are you saying across the board?",
      "GARY COHN: I'm saying across the board. I mean, we are-- we have seen across the board, and we've seen anecdotal evidence of this. I've seen, and I've heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their- their human capital overhead. So just the data for Q2 is pretty, pretty interesting. Corporate revenues rose about 6.3% for Q2 and corporate profits rose close to 12%. The way you do that, unless you're raising prices of the consumer, and we, and we haven't seen a lot of prices go up to consumer, is you have to cut something out of the expense bucket. The one thing they're cutting is they're cutting labor costs. We've seen it in the U.S. data. We've seen it in the private data, and we've seen it in the anecdotal data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president signed an executive order on Friday that I want to ask you about, because you have this role at IBM, and some insight into tech. The order is going to impose a $100,000 one-time fee for visas granted to foreign workers, highly skilled workers, H-1B visas. The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that this caused, like, a panic, because there wasn't a lot of detail, at, like, Apple, and Google, and Microsoft. Did it cause a panic at IBM? I mean, what's going on?",
      "GARY COHN: The- the- I think it caused a panic over the weekend because people weren't sure what was going on with the existing H-1B visas. It's been cleaned up over the weekend, so at- at this point, there's not a panic in the system. Everyone who's got an H-1B visa understands their status and understands how it- how it's- how it's going to work. I actually think this is a good idea. If you understand the H-1B visa program in the United States, historically, it has been a lottery system. So companies have turned in for these visas, and then the U.S. government lotteries them off. If you're now telling a company, look, you need to spend $100,000 to get one of these visas, you're not just going to ask for a- a visa and put a name in the lottery, unless that is a highly skilled person who you need, who you cannot hire in the United States. This visa program is meant for high skilled labor, where you cannot hire that person in the United States. So if that's what it's used for, ultimately we're going to bring high skilled people in the United States. It's going to help grow our economy, and that's good for all of us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll see. Gary Cohn, thank you for your insights, as always. We'll be right back."

      "The interview was taped on Thursday, September 18 at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. See previously released clips\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, Mr. President, if you're ready, we'll dive right in.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for having us here. You know, most countries in the world recognize Palestinian statehood. It's 147 of 193 countries at the UN, but France is going to be the first western UN Security Council member to do so. What conditions are there for this?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, thank you, and thank you for being here and offering me the opportunity to have such a discussion. I think it was a necessity first to decide this recognition, and I will announce it on the 22nd of September at the United Nations, precisely because we are at the very moment where if we want peace and security for all in the region, we have to preserve the condition of a political perspective for everybody. So we will announce the recognition, but which is the beginning of a political process and a peace and security plan for everybody. So right after this- this recognition, we have a first phase, which is, I would say, the emergency phase, ceasefire, release of all hostages..and third, restoring the humanitarian roads and the stabilization of Gaza. We have a second package, which is the day after we will revert on that how to organize Gaza in terms of governance, security and reconstruction. And third package, the perspective of the two states.\u00a0 But recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are not making the release of the hostages a condition before recognition--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: \u00a0So this is a clear condition before we will open an embassy. This is the first series of conditions and requirements we will push-\u00a0 we will put in the peace process. But we will announce the 22nd this recognition of Palestinian state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this is a 'reckless decision.' That's the word he used. He said it gives Hamas little incentive to actually start diplomacy to release the hostages. Why do you disagree with that sequencing?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: So my first point is to say, I don't answer the Hamas with that. I don't meet the expectations of Hamas. Hamas is just obsessed by destroying Israel, but I recognize the legitimacy of so many Palestinian people who want a state, who are a people. They want a nation, they want a state, and we should not push them towards Hamas. If we don't offer them a political perspective and such a recognition, the unique answer will be security, and they will be completely trapped by Hamas as a unique option. My second point is, thanks to this recognition, and thanks to the diplomatic move we launched, we started to isolate Hamas because we- at the New York declaration, which was voted, as you know, by 142 countries. We gathered all the Arab League states, all the leaders of the regions, to work closely with us to precisely dismantle and disarm Hamas. Till now, they were not engaged in such a move. Now we gathered all these states, all these people to work closely with us in this move. So I think this is why we can create the condition of a concrete action, first, to give this right to the Palestinian people, second, to isolate Hamas from the rest of the Palestinians and the whole region, and precisely build security. But let me tell you something which is, for me, very important in this context, Israel had wonderful security results against Hezbollah Hamas top leaders, and managed to- to neutralize a lot of top decision makers of terrorist groups. They did it. This is their merit. But in terms of fighting against Hamas, this is a failure of today. They started--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is a failure?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --Because they- they killed all the key leaders- this is a success. But at the beginning of this war, you had more or less 25,000 Hamas fighters. The Israeli army killed probably half of them, but Hamas managed to recruit the equivalent. You have as many fighters at the very beginning, which is the best evidence of the fact, if we want to dismantle Hamas, the total war is not the answer, because it's just killing the credibility of Israel- and by the way, weakening and killing our own credibility if we don't make a move as the one we are organizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you just pointed to something that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu would say, well, this is why we need to continue until we get rid of every Hamas member. You're saying you can't kill that idea, you need to provide a different idea?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Exactly. But this is so- this is the whole perspective. And look at the situation, not just by the war in Gaza, but everywhere in the region. Hamas was clearly not backed by a lot of people before the seventh of October. If you took the polls in Gaza, but in all the countries of the region, they were very low in all the polls. Today, the level of support is much higher, because they are making the mistake, in fact, to reduce all the perspective of the Palestinians to the Hamas. What we have to say is we want the dismantling of Hamas. You had this success, there is no more top leaders. We want to isolate them. We want to bring everybody working with us to dismantle the Hamas. But recognizing this right to have a Palestinian state through a diplomatic channel, this just giving another channel and offering a political way and isolating Hamas. So, I think there is no future with the option, which would be just, let's kill the maximum number of Hamas people, because they just recruit others and others. Because each time they launch this type of operation, they kill so many civilians that they are just destroying their own reputation and credibility, and they are creating an unsustainable framework of security in the whole region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, since October 7th, popular support in Israel for a Palestinian state has also declined. Prime Minister Netanyahu has been opposed for a very, very long time, and now he says that just look at those attacks that day. If you allow for any kind of Palestinian state, it will be a launch-pad for terrorism. I mean, that is his argument, that this shows you can't allow for the safety and security of Israel if there are two states. Why is he wrong?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: First, I want to- I want to say that the seventh of October was a total trauma for everybody in our country here, because we had so many French people being killed during the seventh of October terrorist attack launched by Hamas. And- and it was, for us, one of the biggest terrorist attack against our own fellow citizen. But we- we did share, and we do share, the pain and the suffer of Israeli people and so many families. And for me, the top priority remains the release of hostages. And I met very regularly families of hostages, and I have to say that what they live is unbearable. And I had the opportunity meet with (unintel) Guy's mother and so many of them, and what they describe is absolutely unbearable. But, I consider that if we want precisely to build a sustainable peace for Israel itself and for Israeli people, a political process and the recognition of a Palestinian state, if the state recognizes the right of Israel to live and defend itself, is demilitarized, has security forces with the vetting process by Israel, with, obviously, a proper governance and reform governance and- and is precisely we have a series of reform which are part of the process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's it, right? You are talking about recognizing the Palestinian Authority, which has some governance over the West Bank, already was working with Israeli security forces. But Hamas came to power through the ballot box in the first place.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, it's- if we are honest, it's totally different. And this is why I think- let's accept the fact that a lot of people worked very hard to kill the credibility of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza years ago, and Hamas appeared as precisely as sort of an alternative option. But, terrorist attacks were launched by Hamas, not by Palestinian Authority. And if we say all those living in Gaza, and all those backing the Palestinian state are de-facto the support of Hamas, there is no end to this war except the you kill everybody. And this is this is terrible. So we have to recognize that the Palestinian Authority has to be reformed. The governance is not satisfactory today. We need a new- you have a new- we need a new Palestinian Authority. But, let's just remark, and, please notice with me, that thanks to the recognition process we launched, for the first time for many years, we got, the ninth of June, a series of clear commitments from the Palestinian Authority. They refused till now. The reform; a new vice president being elected, reform of the education program, a pay forcely, obviously, program as well, with the monitoring by a US audit structure. So we don't just theories --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they denounced October 7th--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: -- And for the very first time --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --20 months later.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: This is true. But for what? Because we made this move. So the recognition is the way as well to re engage and bring them back in the table. And my point is to say, let's isolate Hamas, and let's focus on the dismantling of Hamas from a military and a political point of view. In order to do so, we have to re-engage with those who can be, I would say, a political achievement for Palestinian people. And this is why the recognition is so important. And if we revert to West Bank, one of the key elements which triggered my decision to announce in July, the perspective of the recognition for the 22nd of September is a vote of the Knesset. When the Knesset decided to start the settlements again in West Bank, it was the best evidence of the fact that they don't want to fight against Hamas. There is no Hamas in West Bank. They just want to destroy the existing political bodies, and the possibility of the two states. And I really believe this is a terrible mistake for Israel itself, because in doing so, they just kill any other perspective that war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you- I understand the argument you are making, but it has put you at direct odds with the Trump administration, who argue that your decision to make this recognition announcement, along with all these UN members, that it, in fact, kills the diplomacy they had underway. They said they were working to get, for example, the tax money from the Israelis to hand back over to the Palestinian Authority, that they were doing practical things on the ground to help Palestinians. Secretary Rubio said, that West Bank division you were talking about with the settlements, he drew a direct line to your recognition. Why do you think they're blaming you for that?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, first, I think we all work very hard in order to improve the situation of- of people on the ground. And let me tell you that France, a lot of French people, French doctors, French citizen, French members of NGOs, are working very hard with our administration as well to help Palestinian people. And during the past years, we worked very (UNINTEL) and financed a lot of actions as well being led by UNRWA. Second, I think my- my objective is precisely to- to provide another perspective. We- we- we are closely coordinated with the U.S. administration when we speak about the ceasefire and the release of hostages. We were always in close coordination with Secretary of State, or- or key- key President Trump's advisors, in order to work with Qatar, Egypt, and Israel on the release of hostages, of ceasefire. But your administration is focusing on the day after. And what we propose is a full-fledged plan, where we have first, the emergency package. So let's deliver release of all hostages, ceasefire, and- and humanitarian access. The day we have that, we start the day after. And I think we are very convergent with the work which is being done by- by your administration. What we want is a de facto governance in Gaza, with clearly a sort of transitional- transitional administration, including the Palestinian Authority, excluding, clearly, Hamas. But with a vetting process of Israel and an association of all the neighbors, we have a security package in this- in this day after approach, which is, let's scale up the training of the policemen and security forces of the Palestinians, and--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will do that?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: We- we are already doing that, we're doing so. Many countries of the regions. It does exist, but we need a scale up, and in parallel, we proposed, and we work very closely with the United Kingdom, and all the leaders of the region, precisely to offer a military- I would say, an international force to be deployed in Gaza, with a UN mandate. Which is a unique framework to be defended, and which could be legitimate, to assist and- and back, I would say, this policemen and security forces. And--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know, Israel does not trust the United Nations at all.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No- this is a UN framework, but this- first, they would have a vetting process of all the structure, and it would involve Jordan, Egypt, and some of- some others are ready as well to finance. But obviously it is to be made in close coordination with Israel. And in the security package, obviously, the core element is a dismantling of Hamas. There is no other option if you want to fix the situation, to disarm the Hamas, and precisely, to demobilize so many fighters, to organize what we call a DDR process, which is very familiar to all the experts in- in this type of situation. And this is in this day after for Gaza, in the security package, that we can organize such a DDR, vis a vis Hamas. And to be sure that Hamas will never be involved in the government, but that Hamas will be disarmed, dismantled, with some key people to leave Gaza and some other to be deradicalized, and the weapons to be taken. In order to do so, you need clear security forces here. You need these international forces to be here. And obviously we have the reconstruction. On that, I think there is a strong alignment with the United States. My point is, the recognition and the process we launched with that is the only way to bring with us, on this track, all the neighbors and key countries in order to deliver such a package. And- and look at the situation today, when Egypt, when so many leaders of the region, are not comfortable with what is being done. You need to re-engage them. And this is exactly what we are doing. But my point is to say, if we don't have this full package, the day after is impossible, because today, de facto, you are accepting the displacement of population in Gaza City. How do you want the day after to be possible if you displace thousands of people?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly on this point, when you say, day after, that means when the war ends and some kind of rebuilding happens. What you're talking about with the Trump administration is this idea of having Palestinians leave Gaza, by choice, they say. But some would say that is a step towards ethnic cleansing. In fact, an independent commission set up by the UN concluded Israel has a, quote, \"intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza, as defined by the Genocide Convention.\" Does France agree with that report?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No, we don't qualify as a genocide what's happening because it is not a political statement. This is the judges or the, and or the historians to qualify a genocide by a series of evidence and a clear jurisprudence and clear elements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you reject that report and that finding?",
      "And this is where I try to convince your administration that if we agree on the day after and we want this de facto authority, the security package, the dismantling of Hamas and the reconstruction, let's work on the current day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: If you accept de facto Israel to displace these people, you will never see a day after. And by the way, I look very carefully at all the plans being shared by your administration or shared by experts working for your administration. They always reiterate, let's work and build Gaza for Gazans. It means that they are ready to preserve and protect Palestinian people because Gazans are those who are living in Gaza. But if the precondition of such a plan is to push them out, this is just a craziness. So we, we should not be\u2014for the credibility of the United States, for the credibility of France\u2013we cannot be implicitly or explicitly complacent with such a project. Because such a project, we know it. And by the way, all the security experts, even in Israel, are very clear on the fact it will be a humanitarian disaster. And this project will, will kill the possibility of a day after. So we have to be very explicit on the fact that attacking civilians just to get a few, a few terrorists and a few fighters is clearly not acceptable. But displacing people in order just to take a territory, which is not in the hands of Israel, in order to prepare the day after, is not just totally crazy, but unacceptable for all of us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN : So France has one of the largest both Muslim and Jewish populations --",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: -- This is true. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- in all of Europe. The U.S. Ambassador to France, Charles Kushner, the father of the son-in-law to the President of the United States, Jared's father, he published an article, and I know you've you've read it, saying France is not dealing with antisemitism here in France. He said \"not a day passes without Jews assaulted in the street, synagogues or schools defaced, or Jewish-owned businesses vandalized. Your own Interior Ministry has reported antisemitic incidents even at preschools.\" Do you accept this criticism as genuine and valid?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Not at all. I think this is a mistake and an unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unacceptable statement.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Yes, never a French Ambassador will be allowed to do so. So either you are a person who wants to express freely. Fine. If you are a diplomat, you have to follow the rule of diplomacy. And I'm not the one, this is you to pay the Ambassador of the United States in France, but the taxpayer money is not properly used to finance this kind of statement. So this is not a speech, a letter or a word of an ambassador. This is unacceptable. Now, the matter is much more important. And the matter about antisemitism is, for me, one of my top priority. I was the first president in France to adopt the definition of antisemitism, making it the equivalent of anti-zionism. And I've always been very engaged, again, antisemitism. We've worked very hard during the past few years in order to precisely re-engage, have faster sanctions and I never neglected this topic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know in the U.S. sometimes people hear criticism of Israel as antisemitic. --",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But you're saying it's different. --",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --No. My point is to say, you can, you cannot reject the existence of Israel. Ani, anti-Zionism is unacceptable and is antisemitism. But it doesn't mean that you are not allowed to be in disagreement with the Government of Israel. Otherwise we will become crazy. I'm sorry, but I want to fight very hard against anti, antisemitism. I am very against any anti-Zionist speech, but I do endorse to be in disagreement with Prime Minister Netanyahu and some of his ministers on many topics. It doesn't make me an antisemitic. Otherwise we are completely trapped in an impossible world. And this is precisely why the public debate makes this situation completely crazy. If we want peace and stability and unity, we have to be precise, sharp and respectful. So in this country, for many years, we had this problem with antisemitism like in a lot of other countries. What I disagree with is the argument made by your ambassador and the Prime Minister of Israel, in another public letter, making a link between the recognition and antisemitism. You have, you have a surge of antisemitism in the U.S. and you don't recognize. You have a surge of antisemitism in Germany. Nothing to do with recognition. Everywhere we have such a surge of antisemitism. It started before the seventh of October. A lot of these guys expressed their antisemitism the seventh of October itself. How, as awful it could be, but they did and it increased after. We have to fight against this phenomenon. We have to read - first, we have to sanction. We just passed a law for our high schools and universities to improve the regulations and to be in a situation to sanction all the antisemitism being expressed there. So we are very hard. We work very hard with the Jewish community in, in our country. And, and Jewish people are part of the DNA of the French Republic. So no chance anybody here will abandon the situation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has this hurt your relationship with the U.S.?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No, I don't think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you do have a few other points of friction right now, or different views than the Trump administration.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: My objective on this- on this- on this issue, is- is very clearly to- to engage on the basis of the plan we will put on the table with, with the U.S. administration. And there is a work, an important work, which is made by Mr. Witkoff, Secretary Rubio, but as well Jared Kushner and Tony Blair. So we had many exchange with, with these people and and they work very hard on, on, on important ideas. So my objective is clearly to to engage with this administration, and to show that we can clearly articulate what they have in mind and a full-fledged peace and security plan for all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening here in Europe. In regard to Russia, NATO jets were scrambled twice within just the past few weeks because of these Russian drones that have been crossing into Poland and into Romania. It's the first time in NATO's history that they had to shoot down enemy crafts that had crossed in do you believe that these incursions could have been a mistake, as President Trump has suggested?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Very clearly, Russia is a destabilizing and aggressive power in Europe. They increased, during the past few weeks, the attacks against Kiev and killing a lot of civilians. They destroyed official buildings of the Ukrainian government, but as well premises of the UK Government, of the European Union. And at the same time, during the same weeks, they violated the Polish and the Romanian air. There is no mistake. There is just a project which is to destroy the maximum territories of Ukraine, to have a victory in Ukraine, and just to highlight what they want, the weakness of NATO.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: NATO says they're still investigating. They are not as certain as you seem to be--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --No. I'm not saying--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that Russia did this intentionally.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: I just say this is not totally i- This is not a specific point. If we had a situation where they were declining or decreasing the attacks against Kiev and and on the battlefield. I could accept this argument. My point is to say it's largely beyond that. My point is to say, look at what they did during the past few weeks. So, I sincerely believe that your president was committed and is committed to to make peace in Ukraine, and he engaged, he took the risk to make a summit with President Putin in Anchorage and- and he asked for negotiations. And I think he's right. But at the same time, I have to, just to recognize that there is no clear willingness of President Putin to be sincerely engaged in such a move, because as we were working on a diplomatic way, as we were trying to organize bilateral, trilateral, quadrilateral summit, the Russians were increasing the assaults in Donbas, but not just in Donbas, intensified provocations on one side and attacks on Kyiv on the other side. So I just look at the facts, and your president is as well looking at the facts. So now, what do we do? We have to increase sanctions against Russia, but we have to find the way to precisely put more pressure on Russia to bring them back at the table. In parallel, let me insist on one point. When we came to Washington D.C., a series of European leaders with President Zelenskyy, we took a commitment, we will work to provide to Ukraine security guarantees, and we delivered. A few days ago here in Paris, we gathered what we call the coalition of the willing. You have 30 countries working together in order to provide the day after peace security guarantees to Ukraine. So we have all these elements now with an historical commitment of the Europeans who provide the security guarantees to Ukraine. What we need now is Ukraine to be at the table with Russia and negotiating what the peace agreement could be, on territory, on security guarantee, on the escalation, on recovery etc.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't see any eviden- evidence of Russian interest. I mean it's been more than--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --So now we have to step up, and we need political, military and economic surge in order to bring them back at the table and to negotiate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So to that point, because it's now more than a month since that Alaska Summit, that big risk you said President Trump took. When he's been asked, so why not put sanctions or secondary tariffs on Russia, he points back here at Europe and the consumption of Russian oil and gas that still takes place. I know Hungary and Slovakia, for example, continue to use it.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: This is true, and we are fixing it. And we had discussion with Ursula von der Leyen, and she made a great work with with her teams to fix that. But let's be honest, this is very marginal. This is not a key driver today. We decreased by more than 80% the consumption of oil and gas. And I can tell you, because we were not the most impacted as a country, because we were less dependent on this oil- oil- oil and gas coming from Russia. But we have to finalize- to finish the job. This is true, but now it's clearly much more that when we are to do- what we have to do. We- we have to step up our support to Ukraine, and we have to provide the way to better resist to the new attacks on Kiev and civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's the delay on the sanctions or tariffs then?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: As soon as possible. If it depends just on me, tomorrow. But it doesn't just depend on me. So I hope, I think we have to react collectively if you want my- my strong view, I think it's very important. I think we all agree we want peace. We all agree the problem is Russia because they don't want peace. So now we have to increase the pressure to convince Russia to come back at the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As the Trump administration has pointed to the idea that there are billions of dollars sitting in European bank accounts that could be seized, for example. Or that, you know, here you could put more tariffs on China or sanctions on China. Are these valid arguments by the administration, or are these--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --Look, regarding the frozen assets we are all very much attached to- to be compliant with international rules. And you cannot seize these assets from the central bank even in such a situation. And I think it's a matter of credibility, and it's very important that our countries remain [inaudible] and do respect the international laws. Because this is our problem everywhere. If we speak about Middle East, if we speak about the situation in Ukraine, when some countries start to disrespect international laws and when we are not sufficiently strong, this is the beginning of a total chaos. So we will respect international law. We are predictable, and we will not do all impossible things with these frozen assets. We already took them as, not as a collateral, but we took this frozen asset, and all the proceeds coming from this frozen asset were used to finance our efforts, part of our effort to Ukraine. This is the first point. As for your second point, it was sorry--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I asked about the China aspect. That the administration would like you to push back on China more.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, I think we will have our own diplomacy on China, and we are very much attached to our independence, which is normal. And we have a de-risking strategy, but we are not in a decoupling strategy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's a no on the pressure from the administration to do that?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: My point is, let's focus on some secondary sanctions, if they make sense. I think what we- what we have to do is to engage a serious dialogue in order to see where and in which capacity Russia is helped by third countries, and to increase the pressure. So I think this approach is a good one, but it should be targeted and directly related to Russia. And I think- what I don't think what we- what we will do as Europeans with the US administration, it is working hard in all capacity by capacity, product by product, to see the key countries allowing Russia, sometimes to have a third way and to avoid sanctions or to benefit from the current situation. This is what we call the secondary sanction, because you don't sanction directly Russia, but a third country which is helping them, and this job has to be made, has already started technically. I'm totally in favor of this job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And just a final question here to ask you again about NATO. The US has not contributed fighter jets to that new effort that was just recently announced after the drone incursions. The Supreme Allied Commander is an American, but does that signal something to you? Does that concern you that the United States isn't more muscular here?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No, I'm not concerned or worried about that. I want to say that the NATO Secretary General worked very hard, and we all gathered and exchanged information with the Polish Prime Minister and the Polish president in the hours right after this, what happened. And for instance, UK and France stepped up and we sent fighters. But it's fine. We were in a situation to do so, and we are totally credible. But at the same time, look at what the US is doing in on the Eastern flank of NATO. You are a very strong contributor and reliable partner. So I don't want to- to diminish this role and your commitment and- and I think your President was very clear about, as well, his commitment to NATO. But I- I'm totally in line with the fact that the Europeans have to step up. I've defended for years the fact that we need more independence, more strategic autonomy in- in Europe, and we need a stronger European pillar. This is why, by the way, right after my first election, I started to increase the budget of our army, and in 10 years, we will have doubled this budget. And- and I am already in favor of having all the Europeans increasing their budget, their defense expenditures, and as well building an actual industry research and development basis for defense and security, working together and building a strong, consistent European pillar in NATO. Because it's fair that the US wants to focus much more on its own security, or wants to work much more on the Pacific side, and asks Europeans to be more engaged and committed for their own security. I share this perspective, and this is one of the priority of the Europeans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. President. Thank you for your time today.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Thank you very much for being here and offering me this opportunity to explain our views. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you."

      "He said from November 2024 through July 2025, website visits went from 600,990 to 1,534,929 and strategy calls went from 2,215 to 29,373 in the same period.",

The median tuition rate in Europe and the U.K. costs roughly $9,000 per year, while in the U.S., tuition for a four-year public university\u00a0averages $11,000 - $30,000.",
      "Jyslodet Davis told CBS News her main motivation for studying abroad was that she didn't want to pay \"exorbitant fees for a degree.\"",
      "\"I feel like education should be free and accessible,\" Davis, 21, said, when she latched onto the idea after viewing a video on TikTok.",
      "She didn't know anyone in her high school interested in studying abroad, but since she grew up in a military family and moved around a lot, the leap didn't feel insurmountable. She said she found Beyond the States after viewing a TikTok video and doing some research and used their database to search for schools.",
      "She applied to and chose the Anglo-American University in Prague to study business, arriving in August 2023. Davis said she paid for her studies via a grant for military families, savings and some scholarships.",
      "Davis said since she began university, she has experienced other cultures, and her best friends are from Brazil, Japan and all around the world.",
      "\"I've traveled to 21 countries total,\" she said since moving to Prague.",
      "She also spent a semester abroad at Sophia University in Tokyo, which she said, \"ruined Europe for me, once I saw what school was like in Japan.\"",
      "Now in her senior year, Davis cautioned others on some of the downsides of studying abroad. She detailed the hassles of visas, international bureaucracy, and being far from family.",
      "But her biggest concern was not feeling prepared to enter the U.S. job market without an American education, internships and networking opportunities \u2013 which so many of her friends who attended school in the U.S. had.",
      "Davis said she felt her education in business marketing and communication was not \"on par\" with American schools, and she might have had more opportunities if she had studied international relations. She said she wasn't sure if she was going to return to the U.S. or stay abroad for some time.",
      "Regardless, Davis said she had \"no regrets\" about attending school in Prague and Japan and she would encourage other prospective students to explore a similar path.",

      "Athletes from Russia will be allowed to participate at the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Games under a neutral flag, the International Olympic Committee said on Friday.",
      "The decision by the IOC after a meeting in Milan on Friday was expected and maintains the same sanctions as the Summer Games in Paris last year.",
      "The IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in October 2023 after sanctions were imposed due to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, saying it violated the Olympic Charter.",
      "\"We also spoke about the Independent Neutral Athletes (AINs). This will be nothing new,\" IOC President Kirsty Coventry said at a press conference, according to Reuters. \"The Executive board will take the exact same approach that was done in Paris (2024 Olympics). Nothing has changed.\"",
      "Previously, Russian athletes were permitted to compete under the Russian Olympic Committee, or \"ROC,\" which last made its appearance during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. They were allowed to compete under the \"ROC\" after a series of scandals curtailed their access to the Games, but that was changed for the Paris Games.",
      "Last summer, Russian athletes could only take part under a neutral flag and individual events. They competed without the Russian or Belarusian flag and anthem. Instead, they took part as neutral athletes.",
      "Belarusian athletes faced the same sanctions because Belarus has acted as a staging ground for the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Russian and Belarusian athletes who reach qualifying times will be first vetted for any links to the Russian military or support for the more than three-year war in Ukraine, both of which will exclude them, the IOC said.",
      "Why is Russia banned from the Olympics?",
      "Olympic athletes from Russia have faced a series of scandals and challenges in recent years.",
      "The scandal of Russian athletes taking illegal performance-enhancing drugs burst into public view in 2015 after a series of leaks and investigations. In November 2015, the entire Russian track and field team was suspended after the World Anti-Doping Agency found\u00a0what it called\u00a0a \"culture of cheating.\"",
      "A 2016\u00a0report\u00a0identified more than 1,000 individuals linked to a Russian state-sponsored doping scheme between 2011 and 2014. Russia was banned in 2017 because of the scheme but the IOC gave individual athletes the chance to apply for admission to compete as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia.\" Only 168 Russian athletes passed the vetting process to participate in the 2018 Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, under a neutral Olympic flag. This was the second time Russian athletes had participated under the neutral flag after being in the Unified Team of 1992.",
      "In 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency voted to\u00a0ban Russia\u00a0from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Beijing Winter Games over manipulated doping data. Russian athletes were allowed to compete at the Olympics but only if they could demonstrate that they were not part of the scandal.",
      "In 2023, nearly 20 months into its war with Ukraine,\u00a0the IOC suspended Russia\u00a0with immediate effect for violating the Olympic Charter by incorporating sports councils in four regions in eastern Ukraine. The limited presence of Russians and Belarusians at the 2025 Paris Games satisfied the Olympic body by bringing together athletes from around the world while avoiding a boycott by Ukraine and its closest allies.",
      "Russian teams remain banned. The size of the neutral delegation now depends on the international sports federations, which are responsible for the qualification process and some of which continue to ban Russians and Belarusians from their competitions.",

      "Last year, Barone set the Italian Timekeepers Federation's record on another aircraft carrier in southern Italy, hitting 94.4 mph. In Civitavecchia, on the coast near Rome, he aimed to reach at least 99.4 mph and then hit the brakes in time to avoid launching off the deck's so-called \"ski jump\" and smashing into the cruise ship stationed just fore.",
      "Race engineer Alessandro Tedino told The Associated Press that he wasn't sure the new record was attainable. The ship had been out at sea overnight, and the crew emerged in the early morning to find its flight deck wet. They immediately set to drying it, with the job finished by late summer sunbeams.",
      "\"If it remained wet, then of course it's impossible to have the maximum speed and best brakes. It can be very, very dangerous,\" he said.",
      "As the \"Top Gun\" theme song rang out from speakers, the carrier's portside elevator lifted Barone's team to the deck where journalists, naval officers and VIPs waited. A group of children with Down syndrome, chosen to serve as honorary \"mechanics for the day,\" removed the red, satiny cover to reveal Barone's steed: a red-and-black Ferrari SF90.",
      "Barone eased himself into the supercar, then drove back and forth along the length of the deck several times to warm up its V-8 turbo engine. It roared louder with each pass as he pushed its 1,085 horses harder and harder. Then he placed himself at the far end of the 774-foot flight deck and awaited the all-clear.",
      "\"Here he goes! Here he goes!\" the announcer called as Barone left his mark and zipped past the crowd. Mere seconds later he came to a safe stop, and the crowd applauded haltingly \u2014 impressed by the speedy spectacle, but unsure if he'd beaten the record. The official timekeeper approached the car and inspected the gauges within.",
      "\"The detected velocity: 164 kilometers per hour (101.9 mph). I declare it the new speed record on a ship!\" he said, prompting hearty applause from the sidelines.",
      "Barone lifted his arms to the sky, then hugged his crew, helmet still in place. Reporters swarmed.",
      "\"The main thing you focus on is concentration and then you realize that you are breaking the record only when you are halfway,\" Barone said. \"I have two hands, two feet and I use them at the same time like a pianist.\"",
      "Tedino said that Barone's team will now submit their certified result to Guinness World Records, which told the AP in an email Thursday afternoon that \"we look forward to receiving and reviewing the application and supporting evidence for his latest attempt.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects preserved in amber for the first time in South America, providing a fresh glimpse into life on Earth at a time when flowering plants were just beginning to diversify and spread around the world.",
      "Many of the specimens found at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador date to 112 million years ago, said Fabiany Herrera, curator of fossil plants at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. At least six types of arthropods were found preserved, according to the study.",
      "Almost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's long been \"an enigma\" that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.",
      "This marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.",
      "\"Amber pieces are little windows into the past,\" P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.",
      "The researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that's on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.",
      "Two types of amber were discovered, according to the study: There was a more common form of amber found around the roots of resin-producing plants, and a rarer form of the material formed from resin exposed to air. The amber formed around the roots did not hold any specimens, the study said.",
      "\"A different kind of forest\"",
      "The discoveries provide evidence that the area was once a \"humid, resinous forest ecosystem,\" according to the study.",
      "But today's rainforest is much different from what dinosaurs roamed through, Herrera said. Based on an analysis of fossils in the amber, the ancient rainforest contained species of ferns and conifers, including the unusual Monkey Puzzle Tree, that no longer grow in Amazonia.",
      "\"It was a different kind of forest,\" said Herrera.",
      "The amber deposits were previously known to geologists and miners who worked at the Genoveva quarry. Study co-author Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute first heard of them about a decade ago and set out to find the exact location, aided by geology field notes.",
      "\"I went there and realized this place is amazing,\" Jaramillo said. \"There's so much amber in the mines,\" and it's more visible in the open quarry than it would be if hidden under dense layers of vegetation.",
      "Researchers will continue to analyze the amber trove to learn more about Cretaceous-era biodiversity \u2014 including the insects that contributed to evolution by feeding on flowering plants. \"Amber tends to preserve things that are tiny,\" said Grimaldi.",
      "\"It's the time when the relationship between flowering plants and insects got started,\" said P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente. \"And that turned out to be one of the most successful partnerships in nature.\"",

      "1. Attitude",
      "Having a positive attitude is the No. 1 aspect of super-aging, according to the authors.",
      "\"It's good to have a good attitude. It's kind of a generic belief,\" Cravit said. \"But now, they've researched this right down to the cellular level. It's not just a generically good thing. It affects your health and longevity.\"",
      "\"The SuperAging Workbook\" includes mental exercises to help maintain cognitive ability. (Flashpoint Books)",
      "\"People with a positive attitude outlive people with a negative attitude because it reduces stress, which, in turn, reduces inflammation, and inflammation is the cause of most age-related diseases.\"",
      "Cravit encourages seniors to actively improve their attitude and work on thinking positively.",

      "\"Cultivating contact with people you love, with people you like, expanding your social network, are all very critical.\"",
      "6. Autonomy",
      "Maintaining autonomy can help ensure physical and financial independence as people age, the experts state in the book. Doing things for yourself can help you live longer and offer a greater sense of control over your life.",
      "\"If you're going to live longer, you\u2019ve got to be able to finance it,\" Wolf said. \"You need to manage your money so that it lasts, and you can maintain what you need monetarily to live and thrive well.\"",
      "These seven simple steps will \"grant a longer, healthier and much more fulfilling life,\" the authors said. (iStock)",
      "7. Avoidance",
      "Seniors can face many obstacles as they age, including ageism and online scammers, the authors cautioned.",
      "Wolf encourages seniors to be aware of where information is coming from online and \"who\u2019s offering you what.\"",

    "story": [
      "Heritage Foundation senior fellow Eugene Kontorovitch on how he expects the U.N. General Assembly to behave toward President Donald Trump and key U.S. allies defying the White House by recognizing Palestinian statehood.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron opened his week at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) with a dramatic announcement that France will formally recognize a Palestinian state, seeking to reset the diplomatic agenda on Gaza and signal France's role on the world stage.",
      "As world leaders gather in New York for UNGA, Macron is seizing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to stake out global leadership \u2014 and, critics argue, to position himself as a counterweight to President Donald Trump.",
      "Renewing his call for recognition of a Palestinian state, Macron has also put forward a proposal for a multinational force to take over from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) \"the day after\" the Gaza war, according to The\u00a0Times of Israel.",
      "For Macron, the United Nations General Assembly is a stage to project France as an alternative power. \"Macron\u2019s policy on the Israel-Palestine conflict reflects his broader ambitions on France\u2019s foreign policy, that is, the idea that the country, as a middle European power, can offer an alternative to the U.S.-China competition,\" Jean-Loup Samaan, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital. \"In this specific case, Macron believes that his push for a Palestinian state will increase French credibility in the Arab world and the so-called \u2018Global South.\u2019\"",

      "\"We have to recognize the legitimate right of Palestinian people to have a state,\" Macron said in an interview broadcast Thursday on Israel\u2019s Channel 12. \"If you don\u2019t give a political perspective, in fact, you just put them in the hands of those who are just proposing a security approach, an aggressive approach.\" He went further, denouncing Israel\u2019s ground offensive in Gaza City as \"absolutely unacceptable\" and \"a huge mistake.\"",
      "The comments infuriated both Israel and the United States, which argue that recognition emboldens extremists and rewards Hamas, the group responsible for the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre.",
      "Macron, however, insists recognition is the only way forward, reviving the long-stalled two-state solution. More than 145 countries already recognize Palestine, and European allies, including the U.K., Canada, Australia, Portugal, Malta, Belgium, and Luxembourg, are expected to follow France\u2019s lead in the coming days.",

      "Yet analysts warn Macron\u2019s track record suggests otherwise. \"If you want to know how UN-sponsored peacekeepers do with terrorist groups in the region, we have a 20-year case study in UNIFIL, which enabled rather than denied Hezbollah the ability to grow into a massive military threat,\" Richard Goldberg, senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Macron is certainly driven by his beleaguered domestic political situation and the large French Muslim population, but in his own mind he's also been down this road in Lebanon, where France has historic equities. The record is pretty clear: Macron has never delivered on anything; security improvements have only come through U.S. pressure and Israeli military might,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Just days before Macron\u2019s push, Trump met with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Jared Kushner to discuss Gaza\u2019s future \u2014 and is set to hold a meeting tomorrow with Arab leaders on \"the day after,\" sources confirm to Fox News Digital.

      "Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust, called Macron\u2019s maneuvering \"a blatant power-grab.\" She told Fox News Digital: \"The fact is that would-be Emperor Macron has no clothes. The promise he is waving around of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas\u2019 \u2018promise\u2019 to soon hold elections and abandon dictatorship and terror screams \u2018scam.\u2019\"",
      "\"At home, foreign policy topics are not driving the current political troubles, which are primarily focused on France\u2019s need to reduce its fiscal deficit,\" Samaan noted. \"I think Macron\u2019s initiative on Palestine has more to do with his personal aspirations in terms of legacy.

The setup looked just like the airline's own Wi-Fi service, but it wasn't. Instead, it was what cybersecurity researchers call an \"evil twin,\" a fake hotspot designed to trick people into handing over their credentials.",
      "The idea isn't new, but the setting is. For years, fake Wi-Fi networks have been a common trick in cafes, hotels, and airports. What makes this case stand out is that the attacker took it to the skies, exploiting the growing reliance on in-flight Wi-Fi for entertainment and internet access.",

      "What is an evil twin Wi-Fi attack?",

In this case, the malicious portal requested passengers' email addresses, passwords, or even social media credentials under the pretense of granting access to the airline's entertainment system. The stolen information could then be used for account takeovers, identity theft, or further attacks.",
      "Why travel Wi-Fi is a prime target",
      "Travel creates a perfect storm for these kinds of attacks. Whether you're in a hotel, airport, cruise ship or airplane, you often have limited choices for getting online. Mobile data may be patchy or expensive, which pushes people toward the available Wi-Fi networks. Because these services feel official and are tied to trusted brands, travelers tend to assume they're safe and let their guard down when login requests pop up.",
      "Another trend adds to the risk. Travel providers are increasingly moving entertainment and services onto personal devices instead of offering built-in options. Airlines replace seatback screens with streaming portals, cruise lines promote app-based services and hotels direct guests to digital check-in platforms. All of these require a Wi-Fi connection, which means more people are logging on than ever before.",

      "Why you need a VPN for in-flight Wi-Fi security",
      "One of the best defenses against rogue Wi-Fi is a Virtual Private Network, or VPN. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, making it far harder for attackers to intercept your data even if you connect to the wrong hotspot.",
      "There is a catch, though. In-flight Wi-Fi systems often require you to disable your VPN temporarily to access the onboard portal. Even then, a VPN remains an important safeguard. Once you have cleared the login page and, if you have paid, connected to the internet, enabling your VPN ensures that any browsing, messaging, or app traffic stays private.",

      "A VPN is important, but it isn't the only defense you should rely on. Here are some other ways to stay safe when connecting midair:",
      "Before you even think about connecting to in-flight Wi-Fi, make sure your device has a strong antivirus installed. It's your first line of defense against malicious sites and apps that attackers may try to push through fake portals. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Even if an attacker manages to steal your login credentials,\u00a02FA can stop them from getting into your accounts. Use app-based authenticators rather than SMS codes whenever possible, since they work offline and are harder to intercept.",
      "Most phones and laptops are set to reconnect automatically to familiar networks. This makes it easier for a fake hotspot with the same name to trick your device. Before you board, switch off auto-connect and manually choose the correct airline Wi-Fi.",
      "When browsing in-flight, check for the padlock icon in your browser's address bar. HTTPS encrypts the connection between your device and the website, making it harder for attackers on public Wi-Fi to intercept your data.",
      "Even with precautions, in-flight Wi-Fi should be treated as untrusted. Avoid logging in to sensitive accounts like online banking or work systems. Stick to light browsing, streaming or messaging until you're back on a secure connection.",
      "Outdated operating systems and apps often have security holes attackers exploit. Before your trip, install the latest updates on your phone, tablet or laptop. Many updates include security patches that protect you against known vulnerabilities.",
      "When possible, switch your device to airplane mode and then enable only Wi-Fi. This reduces exposure from other radios (like Bluetooth or cellular roaming) that attackers sometimes target on flights.",
      "Some fake in-flight portals use pop-ups or redirects designed to trick you into entering login details or clicking on malicious links. If a page asks for unnecessary information, like your full Social Security number, banking details or unrelated logins, treat it as a red flag. Close the page immediately and don\u2019t click.",

      "The rise of evil twin attacks in the air is a reminder that convenience often comes with hidden risks. As airlines push more passengers toward in-flight Wi-Fi, attackers are finding ways to exploit that dependency. Next time you fly, think twice before blindly connecting to the first Wi-Fi network that pops up. Sometimes, the safest choice is to stay offline until you land.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "AI browsers are no longer just an idea; they're already here. Microsoft has built Copilot into Edge, OpenAI is testing a sandboxed browser in agent mode and Perplexity's Comet is one of the first to fully embrace the concept of browsing for you.",
      "This is agentic AI stepping into our daily routines, from searching and reading to shopping and clicking. Instead of simply assisting us, these tools are beginning to replace us.",
      "But with this shift comes a new era of digital deception. AI-powered browsers may promise convenience by handling shopping, emails and other tasks, yet research shows they can stumble into scams faster than humans ever could. This dangerous mix of speed and trust is what experts call Scamlexity, a complex, AI-driven scam landscape where your agent gets tricked, and you pay the price.",

      "Falling for the same old tricks",
      "AI browsers are not immune to classic scams. In fact, they can fall for them even faster. When researchers at Guardio Labs told an AI browser to buy an Apple Watch, it confidently completed the purchase on a fake Walmart store set up in minutes. It autofilled personal and payment details without hesitation. The scammer got the money, while the human never saw the red flags.",
      "AI browsers promise convenience, but security experts warn they can fall for online scams faster than humans. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Handling phishing emails from \"your bank\"",
      "Old phishing tactics also remain effective. In testing, researchers at Guardio Labs sent a fake Wells Fargo email to the AI browser. The browser clicked the malicious link with no verification and even helped the user fill out login credentials on the phishing page. By removing human intuition from the loop, the AI created a perfect trust chain that scammers could exploit.",
      "PromptFix: A modern AI injection scam",
      "The real danger comes from attacks designed specifically for AI. Researchers at Guardio Labs created PromptFix, a scam disguised as a CAPTCHA page. While humans would only see a checkbox, the AI agent read hidden malicious instructions in the page code. Believing it was \"helping,\" the AI clicked the button, triggering a download that could have been malware. This type of prompt injection bypasses human awareness and targets the AI's decision-making directly. Once compromised, the AI can send emails, share files or execute harmful tasks without the user ever knowing.",
      "The growing risks of AI browsers",
      "As agentic AI becomes mainstream, scams will scale at an alarming speed. Instead of fooling millions of people individually, attackers need only to compromise one AI model to reach millions at once. Security experts warn this is a structural risk, not just a phishing problem.",
      "Tips to protect yourself from AI browser scams",
      "AI browsers can save time, but they can also put you at risk if you rely on them too much. Use these practical steps to stay in control and reduce your chances of becoming a victim.",
      "Always double-check sensitive actions like purchases, downloads or logins. Keep final approval in your hands instead of letting the AI complete tasks on its own. This way, you prevent scammers from sneaking past your awareness.",
      "Scammers rely on exposed personal details to make their tricks more convincing. A trusted data removal service can help scrub your information from broker sites, reducing the chance that your AI agent hands over details that are already floating around online. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Buying refurbished electronics sounds like a no-brainer. You get the latest gadgets at a fraction of the cost while giving devices a second life, which is better for the environment. It seems like the perfect solution for those on a budget, but it isn't always that simple. Not every refurbished device is equal, and the fine print matters more than you think.",
      "Some sellers do a fantastic job restoring products, while others barely touch them before reselling.

      "AMAZON'S SECRET RENEWED STORE DEALS: SAVE ON APPLE PRODUCTS, NINJA AIR FRYERS, SHARK VACUUMS AND MORE",
      "Researching a seller\u2019s track record is more important than chasing after the lowest refurbished price point. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Imo/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "1) Refurbished does not always mean like new",
      "In the tech industry, the label refurbished carries no uniform standard. From factory-certified devices that meet stringent quality checks to third-party refurbishments that address only surface-level defects, the range is vast. My experience shows that treating refurbished items as \"like new\" is a mistake. Many come with cosmetic blemishes or partially worn components, and some sellers stop at a basic reset and cleaning.",
      "The key is to scrutinize the seller's refurbishment process and request detailed specifications or photos to ensure the item is in good condition. Look for transparency about what has been repaired or replaced. A reputable refurbisher will disclose whether critical components such as screens, batteries or motherboards were replaced or simply tested.",
      "Pro tip: Many refurbishers use a grading system (A, B, C). Grade A means near new, Grade B usually has light scratches, while Grade C shows heavier wear. Knowing the grade helps set realistic expectations.",
      "2) Check the warranty and return policy",
      "One of the most overlooked yet critical aspects of buying refurbished electronics is the warranty and return policy. Through years of testing products, I've seen warranties vary wildly from generous 90-day coverage to none at all. A solid warranty is not just a formality; it's a reflection of the refurbisher's confidence in the quality of the product. Without it, you're taking a gamble.",
      "Industry best practices suggest opting for sellers who provide at least a 90-day warranty and a clear, no-hassle return window. I have consistently seen reliable refurbishers like Amazon Renewed, eBay Certified Refurbished and Back Market stand by their work with transparent policies.",
      "Also look at Apple Certified Refurbished and Dell Outlet, which are industry leaders for high-quality laptops, tablets and phones.",
      "3) Know the seller's reputation",
      "Not all sellers are equal when it comes to refurbished tech. My years covering consumer electronics have made it clear that choosing a reputable seller is more important than chasing the lowest price. Factory-certified refurbishers and authorized resellers tend to follow strict testing and quality control procedures. In contrast, independent sellers often vary in quality and reliability.",
      "I always emphasize researching the seller's history, reading verified customer reviews and ensuring they offer clear refurbishment guarantees. Established marketplaces and brand-certified stores provide additional layers of security, including dispute resolution mechanisms.",
      "Red flags include: vague warranty language, listings with only stock photos, \"open box\" items marketed as refurbished and any product sold \"as-is.\" If you see those, walk away.",
      "4) Don't forget accessories and packaging",
      "A less obvious but important consideration is the state of accessories and packaging. In industry practice, refurbished products rarely arrive in original packaging or with the full set of accessories. I've seen that some sellers ship devices with generic boxes and subpar third-party accessories or omit chargers and manuals altogether.",
      "If accessories are important to your workflow, don't assume they'll be included. Always verify the listing description and, when in doubt, ask the seller directly. Knowing exactly what comes in the box prevents surprises and ensures you don't have to hunt for compatible chargers or cables after the fact, potentially eroding any savings you initially gained.",
      "5) Battery life may not be the same",
      "A common misconception is that refurbished devices come with batteries that perform like new, but that's not the case. Batteries naturally degrade with use, and not all refurbishers replace them.",
      "Some sellers disclose battery replacement while others do not. It is critical to confirm whether the battery is new, tested or original. Otherwise, expect performance issues such as rapid discharge or failure to hold a charge. A device with a worn-out battery is rarely worth the lower upfront cost, as you'll likely need to replace the battery soon after purchase.",
      "SAVE UP TO 64% ON DYSON, DEWALT, ANKER, ADIDAS AND MORE DURING EBAY'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY SALE",
      "A good warranty and return policy are essential safeguards for choosing refurbished devices. (Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "6) Software updates and compatibility",
      "You should only use electronic items like phones, laptops, tablets and smartwatches as long as they're receiving software updates. Many might disagree with this, but the truth is that once software support ends, your device becomes vulnerable to all kinds of unpatchable security flaws. Some good brands known for reliable software support are Apple, Samsung, Google, MSI and Lenovo.",
      "Before purchasing, always verify that the device is still supported with regular updates. This information is often available on the manufacturer's website or through trusted tech resources.",
      "7) Test the device thoroughly after purchase",
      "Testing a refurbished device thoroughly upon arrival is a best practice I've recommended repeatedly in my writing. Even trusted sellers can occasionally miss a defect. I always advise checking every essential function, such as the screen, charging port, Wi-Fi, sound and camera, within the seller's return period. Many problems won't be obvious from photos or descriptions alone.",
      "Immediate testing ensures you catch issues early enough to return or replace the product without hassle. It's a small investment of time that prevents far bigger frustrations later.",
      "And don't forget to perform your own factory reset on\u00a0iPhone,\u00a0Android,\u00a0PC or Mac to ensure no old accounts, locks or data are lingering on the device. For Apple devices, make sure \"Find My iPhone\" has been disabled before purchase, or it may be unusable.",
      "8) Install strong antivirus software",
      "Refurbished devices can sometimes carry hidden risks, especially if the previous owner didn't wipe the device properly or if the seller missed deep software issues. Installing\u00a0 strong antivirus software is essential to protect your device from malware, spyware or other security threats that may be lurking.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "9) Use a password manager",
      "Security doesn't end with antivirus protection. Many refurbished devices come with pre-installed software or misconfigured settings that could expose you to risk. One of the smartest moves you can make is using a reliable password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "10) Know the real value of your savings",
      "Refurbished doesn't always mean a bargain. As a rule of thumb, expect to save 20-40% compared to new, depending on the brand, age and condition. If you're only saving 10-15%, the trade-off on warranty, lifespan or battery may not be worth it. Calculate the long-term cost, especially if you'll need to buy a new battery or accessories soon after.",
      "6 KITCHEN ITEMS THAT EXPERTS 'WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND' BUYING AT SECONDHAND SHOPS",
      "Refurbished products often arrive without original packaging or accessories, leaving buyers unprepared. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Bonus: The eco-friendly upside",
      "Every refurbished device purchased keeps one more gadget out of the landfill and reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing. Studies show buying refurbished can cut a product's carbon footprint nearly in half. That means you're not only saving money but also helping the planet.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Buying refurbished electronics can be a great way to save money and reduce e-waste. But it pays to be careful. By sticking with certified sellers, knowing what \"refurbished\" really means and insisting on warranties and clear return policies, you can protect both your wallet and your data.",

      "Video game companies, like Sony, are working to make sure all their players - especially the younger ones - are safe on gaming consoles.",
      "As kids pick up a controller and headset to play their favorite video games, companies across the gaming industry are working to make sure all their players are safe on their consoles. \u00a0Sean Whitcomb, Program Director for Child Safety and Education at Sony Interactive Entertainment says Sony and other major gaming brands are adding more safety measures, \"We offer some family management tools that will help them create an experience that is really about uh shared boundaries and conversations that aren't really controlling, but more about connecting.\"",
      "Young players and their parents can set up the safety tools together to ensure a fun and safe gaming environment. As these features are meant to give families full control over what is, and isn't shared online, while also letting young gamers enjoy their favorite titles. \u00a0\"We're making it easier for this to be a safe experience that everyone is comfortable with,\" says Whitcomb.Beyond just setting up parental controls, Whitcomb encourages parents to actively participate in their kids' gaming lives. He suggests that one of the best ways to understand what your child is playing is to join them. \u00a0He suggests, \"Maybe pick up the controller and play with them too. That's probably one of the easiest ways to understand what your child is experiencing.\"",
      "And when it comes to who your kids are playing with, Whitcomb says parents should treat the digital world like a playground, \"It's more like, well, who is this person? How old are they? Where do they live? And why do you wanna spend more time playing with them? .... So, it's just a conversation that I really recommend parents have with their children.\"\u00a0According to Whitcomb you can also score points with your children by using Sony's parental control features to encourage better habits away from the screen, including more game time as a reward for doing chores around the house.",

However, travel security experts and industry observers note that, while cases are increasing, the scam may not be extremely widespread or high-volume at this time.",
      "Most tags only contain limited information, such as name, flight number and baggage IDs, and airlines' tracking systems can sometimes detect if a claim is fake by reviewing baggage scan logs and RFID tagging. There are also no official warnings or statistics from major airlines, government authorities or law enforcement indicating this technique has reached epidemic levels or led to confirmed prosecutions.",

      "Wait until you're at home, in your car or in another private location before taking tags off your checked bags. This prevents scammers from grabbing them in public areas.",
      "Never toss tags in the trash intact. Tear them up or cut through barcodes and printed details so they can't be reused for fake claims.",
      "Dispose of tags yourself instead of leaving them in a hotel wastebasket. Cleaning staff or other guests could find and misuse them.",
      "Treat printed boarding passes the same way as luggage tags. Keep them until you can destroy them securely.",
      "Watch for anyone loitering near the carousel and observing passengers closely. Stay aware of your surroundings while handling travel documents.",
      "Opt for mobile boarding passes instead of printed ones. This removes the risk of discarded paper passes falling into the wrong hands.",
      "Avoid printing your full home address or primary phone number. Instead, use your name, a travel-only email and either a P.O. box or work address. You can even create a simple alias email just for travel, which forwards to your main inbox but keeps your real address private. This way, airlines and honest finders can still reach you without exposing sensitive personal details to scammers.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Another way to protect yourself is by putting a small tracker inside your luggage, such as an\u00a0Apple AirTag or a\u00a0similar Bluetooth tracker. These devices connect to your phone and let you see where your bag is in near real-time. If your suitcase goes missing or ends up in the wrong place, you\u2019ll know faster than waiting for the airline to track it down.",
      "Place the tracker inside your bag rather than on the handle so it can\u2019t be easily removed. Check its location through your phone before leaving the airport, and keep an eye on it during layovers. While AirTags can\u2019t prevent someone from misusing an old luggage tag, they give you proof of where your bag actually is if you ever need to dispute a lost luggage claim or theft.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "While the luggage tag scam may not be widespread yet, it exploits a simple oversight that most travelers rarely consider. Until airlines and airports put better safeguards in place, the burden falls on passengers to protect their own information. That means treating something as ordinary as a bag tag like sensitive data.",

      "What has changed since 1999 is the digital landscape, Brauchler said, noting that online forums amplify manifestos, glorify killers and celebrate body counts like video game scores. After Kirk\u2019s murder, graphic crime scene images spread within minutes \u2014 a chilling reminder of cultural desensitization.",
      "\"What\u2019s different now is the real-time exposure. Kids see killings and violence on social media instantly, up close. That kind of desensitization didn\u2019t exist during Columbine or Aurora,\" Brauchler said.",

      "According to research by the ADL, the shooter had spent a significant amount of time in online environments that promote violent and extremist ideologies. Investigators found that he ultimately adopted these beliefs himself.",
      "The shooter maintained an account on a graphic content forum called WatchPeopleDie, where he had interacted with posts discussing mass shootings in Parkland (2018), Buffalo (2022) and a 2017 attack at a mosque in Quebec City, according to the report.",

In a report published in August 2025, the ADL revealed that Natalie Rupnow and Solomon Henderson, the individuals behind the Madison and Nashville shootings, were also users of the site. That same month, a teenager in Morocco posted a manifesto and announced plans for a mass stabbing on WatchPeopleDie, as well as on X and 8kun.",
      "The ADL\u2019s findings show that the platform frequently hosts White supremacist, antisemitic and other extremist material. Users, including minors, are exposed to highly graphic violence that is often celebrated by the community, which may lead to desensitization and a heightened risk of radicalization and ideologically driven violence, the organization noted.",

It is not the government\u2019s job to tell us what we can and cannot talk about.\" He added that the message sent by the sequence of events at ABC \u201cis a message that the First Amendment is no longer a right that can be counted on.\"",
      "Mamdani referred to \u201cthe responsibility that all of us have in this moment to showcase just how unacceptable these kinds of actions are, how unacceptable it is that we are living in a moment where Donald Trump\u2019s actions are the ones which determine whether or not we can enjoy that which we have taken for granted for so many years.\u201d",
      "He added that, \"We cannot be free if we are subservient to those who abuse power for their own ends,\" taking shots not only at Trump, but his two main competitors in the mayoral election, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "\"We cannot understand this moment of authoritarianism as solely coming from the White House when it is also a moment that is characterized by the cowardice of those in response to it, the cowardice that we have seen typified, whether by the parent company of ABC, or by so-called leaders like Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams,\" he added.",
      "Mamdani had said he was withdrawing from the town hall event \u201cin response to the corporate leaders who will put their bottom line ahead of their responsibility in upholding the freedom of the press.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Taking up a major case about the structure of the federal government, the Supreme Court agreed Monday to consider whether President Donald Trump can fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission despite a law that limits his ability to do so.",
      "While the court is deciding the case, a lower court ruling in favor of the commissioner, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, will remain on hold, the court said. That means she will not remain in office while the case is litigated.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi welcomed the court's intervention, saying on X that \"the president, not a lower court judge, has hiring and firing power over executive officials.\"",
      "In weighing the case, the conservative-majority court will decide whether a key 1935 Supreme Court ruling called Humphrey's Executor v. United States, which upheld restrictions on the president's power to fire FTC members, should be overturned.",
      "The ruling would apply not just to the FTC but also to other federal agencies with similar restrictions.",
      "\"Congress gave independent regulators removal protections to preserve the integrity of our economy,\" Slaughter's lawyers said in a statement. \"Giving the executive branch unchecked power over who sits on these boards and commissions would have seismic implications for our economy that will harm ordinary Americans.\"",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts had issued a temporary stay on Sept. 8 that allowed Trump to remove Slaughter from office.",
      "Three liberal justices dissented from the court's decision to allow Slaughter's firing while litigation continues.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the 1935 ruling remains on the books until such time as the court overturns it. But in the meantime, the court has summarily \"handed full control of all those agencies to the president,\" she wrote.",
      "Complaining about the court's growing number of decisions that grant emergency requests filed by the Trump administration, Kagan said the process had been used \"to transfer government authority from Congress to the president, and thus to re-shape the nation's separation of powers.\"",
      "The court's actions would suggest the conservative majority is sympathetic to the Trump administration's arguments that the legal provisions restricting the president's ability to remove FTC members without cause unlawfully limit his powers under Article 2 of the Constitution.",
      "A second legal question concerns whether Slaughter even has a legal avenue to remain in office if she ultimately wins on her argument that the firing was illegal.",
      "The court said oral arguments will be held in December.",
      "Trump fired both Democratic commissioners on the five-member FTC, Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, in March. Both challenged the move, although Bedoya later dropped out of the case.",
      "A federal judge ruled in favor of Slaughter in July, citing the 1935 Supreme Court precedent. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reached a similar conclusion.",
      "This year, Trump has also sought to remove members of other independent federal agencies, which the Supreme Court has allowed.",
      "The Supreme Court, whose majority has been skeptical of the concept of independent federal agencies that are not subject to presidential control, has undermined such protections in recent years in a series of cases involving other agencies.",
      "Trump has sought to dramatically reshape the federal government using an aggressive form of executive power.",
      "In addition to seeking to control hitherto independent agencies, he has also sought to dismantle some agencies and has fired thousands of federal workers.",
      "In another high-stakes showdown, he is trying to assert control over the Federal Reserve, which has traditionally acted independently."

      "Another issue is whether Schiff, James and Comey could ever get a fair trial if it were to come to that, said Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at New York University School of Law.",
      "\u201cHe is his own worst enemy,\u201d Gillers said of Trump.",

I can\u2019t imagine that a court would let that go to a verdict. The prejudice from that kind of statement is enormous,\u201d Gillers said.",
      "John Walsh, who served as the U.S. attorney in Colorado for six years ending in 2016, said in an interview: \u201cIt certainly gives the defense an argument that the charges are politically motivated and not based on the merits and the evidence and the argument. Some judges might find that persuasive depending on the motions that take place prior to trial.\u201d",
      "But he added that even if the Justice Department understands this reality, officials could be pursuing a strategy that he described as, \u201cInvestigation is the punishment.\u201d",

So, it\u2019s a lose-lose, no matter what.\u201d",

His public statements to the attorney general were not wise and they undermine the citizens\u2019 confidence of our legal system.\u201d",
      "A worrying development came last week, critics said, when the federal prosecutor tasked with investigating mortgage fraud allegations against James resigned after Trump said he no longer wanted him to serve in that position. (Trump said he fired the prosecutor, Erik Siebert.)",
      "Trump administration officials had been pressing Siebert to investigate potential mortgage fraud charges against James.",

      "\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s administration started this \u2018lawfare\u2019, as the media calls it, and I worried then that they had unleashed spirits they would be unable to control,\u201d he added. \u201cI questioned Attorney General Bondi about this in her confirmation hearing, and she agreed with me.

    "summary": "The fast-paced game, which has millions of fans around the world, is starting to build a cult following in the U.S., with waiting lists to play in the few courts available.",
    "story": [
      "You\u2019ve heard of pickleball, the wildly popular sport that\u2019s gone mainstream. But now there\u2019s padel \u2014 another racket sport that\u2019s surging in popularity and one that has strong Latino roots.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sport that always keeps you on your toes,\u201d said Roy Tabet, a professional padel player and a coach at Reserve Padel, one of the biggest luxury padel brands in the U.S., with clubs in Miami and New York.",
      "Tabet said he had played tennis his whole life but started finding it repetitive.",
      "\u201cI started playing padel and I immediately felt the passion. The hype for the game was real,\u201d he said in an interview with the \u201cTODAY\u201d show\u2019s Morgan Radford.",
      "Padel got its start in Acapulco, Mexico, in 1969 when Enrique Corcuera, a Mexican businessman, was trying to build a makeshift tennis court in his backyard. He didn\u2019t have enough space and chose to make a smaller version \u2014 the very first padel court \u2014 with a distinguishing feature: It was surrounded by an almost 10-foot wall.",
      "The sport would eventually grow and spread internationally. It\u2019s now described as the fastest-growing sport worldwide. The International Padel Federation says padel is played in more than 140 countries around the world with about 30 million amateur players.",
      "Currently in the U.S., there are over 100,000 amateur players, according to PadelUSA, an online marketplace for padel equipment, but the number of padel courts has been increasing.",
      "The sport\u2019s growing popularity has even captured the attention of athletes and celebrities like Eva Longoria, Derek Jeter, Jimmy Butler and Adam Levine.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like pickleball but kind of a little cooler,\u201d Levine told Jimmy Fallon in April on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s super fun,\u201d the singer added, explaining he was first introduced to the sport by Michael Bubl\u00e9, his fellow coach on \u201cThe Voice,\u201d when they were vacationing together in Mexico.",
      "Padel differs from other racket sports in that the court is about one-third the size of a tennis court and is typically surrounded by a glass or mesh wall. The ball can be hit off the walls and even from outside the court, as players can exit the court through a door to return the ball. Players must have a teammate, as the sport can only be played in doubles.",
      "A big draw, fans say, is the community it fosters as well as the game\u2019s fast pace.",
      "\u201cWhat got me hooked is the community. I feel like I met a lot of my best friends here, so coming to see them specifically turned into my love for playing padel,\u201d Rachel Kuan, who's now a customer experiences employee at Reserve Padel, told \"TODAY.\"",
      "Santiago Gomez, who fell in love with the game while growing up in Acapulco, founded Padel Haus, a sprawling padel social and cultural hub located in New York City \u2014 and among the first dedicated padel courts in the U.S. Padel Haus has since opened more courts across the New York City area as well as in Atlanta, Nashville and Denver.",
      "\u201cA lot of Latinos were first \u2014 they were the first ones to come because they play the sport at home,\u201d Gomez said.",
      "\u201cAmericans didn\u2019t know about the sport when we first opened in 2022,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then after that, a lot of tennis players, former tennis players, former squash players \u2014 Americans \u2014 came and tried it for the first time and they fully converted to padel.\u201d",
      "Gomez estimates that about 70% of Padel Haus\u2019 members are from the U.S. while the remaining 30% hail from other countries. The growth has increased so significantly that there\u2019s now a waitlist for people looking to sign up.",
      "Fast pace 'keeps you hooked'",
      "In addition to the social aspect of the game, Gomez said it\u2019s addictive because of how fast-paced it can get compared to other racket sports.",
      "\u201c[In tennis], a ball passes you, your mind is wired to think that the point is over. But here, given the wall\u2019s in the back, you can still save the point. So you feel like a hero when you\u2019re catching a ball that you couldn\u2019t catch in tennis,\u201d Gomez said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re still in the game, and that gives you [a] big dopamine rush and that\u2019s what keeps you hooked.\u201d",
      "The International Padel Federation is working on getting the sport included in the 2032 Olympics. But for some like Marnie Perez-Ochoa, the game has also become a point of cultural pride: her grandmother Yola Ramirez was a former professional tennis player from Mexico and her grandfather built padel courts for professional tournaments in Acapulco.",
      "\u201cThe power of sport is so prevalent \u2014 it\u2019s just now getting started in the States. You see it in Mexico. It already boomed in Europe \u2014 Spain in particular. So I\u2019m really excited to see where it\u2019s going to go in the States. And I think it\u2019s really beautiful that it started in Mexico,\u201d Perez-Ochoa said."

      "\u201cOK, so I can\u2019t make it through the whole trailer. It's too weird for me,\u201d Wolfe Herd said of the movie during an interview with CNBC.",
      "She explained she wasn't involved in the making of \"Swiped\" \u2014 which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival this month \u2014 and actually didn't want the movie to be made at all.",
      "\u201cFrankly,\u201d said Wolfe Herd, \u201cI was informed about this movie after it was already off to the races. I think they had already written the script and done all these things.",
      "\"I was even, like, asking my lawyer two years ago, like, 'What do I do? I don't want a movie made about me. Shut it down.' He's like, 'There's nothing you can do. You're somewhat of a public figure. There\u2019s public information out there. They\u2019re going to do what they\u2019re going to do,'\" she said.",
      "The entrepreneur added that she was now \"terrified and maybe slightly flattered\" about the movie. \"But I think the strangeness and the fear of it outweighs any flattery. So listen, we\u2019ll just see. I guess I gotta get some popcorn and stay tuned.\u201d",
      "Wolfe Herd said she is pleased about one aspect of the movie \u2014\u00a0 the casting of James, who previously portrayed Pamela Anderson in Hulu's controversial biographical drama \"Pam & Tommy.\"",
      "\u201cI am honored that they chose Lily James. She\u2019s a talented actress,\" said Wolfe Herd.",
      "Wolfe Herd founded Bumble at 25 in 2014, the same year she sued Tinder and its parent company, IAC, on grounds of sexual harassment and discrimination.",
      "Wolfe Herd, who was the company\u2019s former vice president of marketing, filed a lawsuit in June 2014 accusing the company\u2019s co-founder and chief marketing officer Justin Mateen \u2014 whom she briefly dated \u2014  of sending her \u201ca barrage of horrendously sexist, racist, and otherwise inappropriate comments, emails and text messages,\u201d according to NBC News.",
      "She also alleged in her lawsuit that Mateen and the company's CEO, Sean Rad, stripped her of her title as co-founder because she was a woman. She sought compensatory damages, including restitution, lost pay and punitive damages.",
      "She settled her lawsuit in September 2014 \"without admission of wrongdoing\" on Tinder's part, a lawyer representing Wolfe Herd told NBC News at the time.",
      "After leaving Tinder, Wolfe Herd created Bumble, a dating app where women notably make the first move. She hoped the app would allow women more agency when it came to dating, she told The New York Times in May 2025.",
      "Though she didn't set out to create a feminist dating app, she understands the label, she told the publication.",
      "\"This was before MeToo, before Time\u2019s Up, before Target started selling all the girl-power T-shirts,\" she said. \"Feminism had not gone mainstream. I didn\u2019t wake up and see some market opportunity to go build a feminist this or a feminist that.\"",
      "\"It was genuinely a real lived experience where I felt that as a young woman who had dated, I did not feel like an equal. You couldn\u2019t text a guy first in college. You were considered crazy, desperate,\" she added.",
      "\"And then, of course, the media and everyone else said, 'Oh, it\u2019s feminist, it\u2019s girl power,' and I was like, Well, yeah, I guess you could technically call it feminist because it\u2019s about trying to level the playing field,\" she concluded."

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of me in Cherry, and there\u2019s a bit of me in Laura. I sympathize with both of them. The greatest tragedy is that they\u2019re both smart, they\u2019re both witty. In any other situation, they would be friends,\u201d Frances, who has worked in TV for 20 years, tells TODAY.com.",
      "In \u201cThe Girlfriend,\u201d Laura (played by Robin Wright), meets and immediately becomes suspicious of her son\u2019s new girlfriend, Cherry (Olivia Cooke). Cherry met Daniel (Laurie Davidson) at the real estate agency where she works after they made eyes at each other passing by on the street. Is Cherry, as Laura suspects, only after Daniel for his family's money? Is Laura, as Cherry believes, an unnecessary obstacle standing between her and her dream relationship (and life)?",

      "Michelle Frances on Laura and cherry",
      "Both \u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d series and book take alternate perspectives to unspool the story from Laura and Cherry\u2019s viewpoints.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many ways here where we can play dual perspectives \u2014 and both are right. Who\u2019s the villain? Who\u2019s the psychopath? It could be either. It could be both. It could be neither,\u201d Frances says.",
      "Both arguably tragic, the book ends differently than the series. Below, we speak to Frances in more detail about the series, its inspiration and what could have been.",
      "The Inspiration for \u2018The Girlfriend\u2019",
      "Frances, who works in TV production, says her debut novel had two origins: one going back to her own experiences and another from a story she\u2019d heard.",
      "\u201cI had a friend who needed to get a job to pay the bills, and so she went to work in an estate agent in a really nice part of London. Anyway, in comes a young man. They hit it off. Start dating. Year later, she\u2019s walking up the aisle, and her wedding present from her new in-laws is a seven-bedroom house with a swimming pool,\u201d Frances recalls, laughing.",
      "From there, she invented the character of Cherry, who sees, in Daniel, a ladder out of the modest neighborhood she grew up in.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s sort of caught in a circle of poverty that she wants to break out of, but she\u2019s smart and she\u2019s ambitious and she\u2019s romantic,\u201d she says.",
      "Then, Frances thought back to her own life. Like Cherry, she was unable to attend university because of high fees. She watched as other classmates, who hadn\u2019t done as well in school, moved forward.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of being told to stay in my lane,\u201d Frances summarizes of Cherry's thinking.",
      "Could Laura Ever Have Been a Good Mother-in-Law?",
      "A turning point in \u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d comes when Laura makes up a lie to try and get rid of Cherry for good. After Daniel gets into an accident, she tells Cherry he\u2019s died, but he\u2019s actually on the mend.",
      "Was she destined to despise the woman Daniel brought home? Frances, who was raising her young children while she was writing \u201cThe Girlfriend,\u201d thinks Laura would \u201calways find fault\u201d with a potential romantic partner.",
      "But \u201cshe probably would have been more accepting with some people who played the game a little bit differently,\u201d Frances says. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly an essence of snobbery about Laura, not necessarily from where Cherry comes from, that because she lies about where she comes from.\u201d",
      "She thinks Laura\u2019s personality is a result of the loss of her daughter, Rose. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s looking for a Rose replacement\u201d in a daughter-in-law, she says.",
      "Can Daniel Be Blamed for the Ending?",
      "\u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d hurtles toward conflict as Laura and Cherry circle each other like adversaries. Meanwhile, Daniel watches on, somewhat clueless.",
      "How much can Daniel and his conflict avoidance be blamed for what comes next?",
      "\u201cI think he is probably subconsciously ignoring a lot of the conflict because he just doesn\u2019t want to deal with it. It isn\u2019t until it\u2019s too late that he sort of wakes up to the fact that, oh s---, this is actually quite serious,\u201d Frances says.",
      "\u201cHe genuinely wants them to get on. He probably is very dismissive,\u201d she continues.",
      "How the Book\u2019s Ending Compares to the Show",
      "Warning: Spoilers continue from here.",
      "The toxic triangle of \u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d concludes differently depending on whether it\u2019s in book or TV form.",
      "In both, Cherry, Daniel and Laura gather for a showdown at Laura\u2019s house. Laura is trying to convince Daniel that his girlfriend is dangerous and has some compelling evidence. (Her actions in the book are especially gruesome and involve killing a puppy \u2014 seriously).",
      "Frances knew, while writing, one of them wasn\u2019t going to make it out alive, but she didn\u2019t know who.",
      "\u201cIt was really interesting, because it could have been any one of the three,\u201d she says. \u201cAs I wrote it, I did not know. I was just kind of playing out, playing out and seeing what happened on the pages.\u201d",
      "Laura emerges victorious in the book. Cherry charges at her and Laura steps out of the way, but also subtly pushes her out the window.",
      "The ending is far different in the show, and the changes were star, director and executive producer Wright\u2019s idea. After seeing Laura and Cherry wrestling in Laura\u2019s home pool, Daniel jumps in and drowns his own mother. This leaves Cherry alive, and after a one-year time jump, viewers see she's pregnant with Daniel\u2019s baby at the end of the series.",
      "\u201cI would say maybe she\u2019s won the battle. Maybe not the war,\u201d Frances says of Cherry. \u201cThese things tend to come back and bite you on the bum, don\u2019t they, in some form or another?\u201d",
      "Frances says the calculation also had to do with the potential continuation of the story (which, as of the writing of this article, has not been renewed).",
      "\u201cWell, if you have a Series 2, how\u2019s that going to work? If we have a series, you\u2019re thinking, 'OK, which one of these do you want to keep alive the most?'\u201d she says.",
      "Frances\u2019 Writing Obsession",
      "Frances has followed up \u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d with other novels including \u201cThe Temp,\u201d about an ambitious woman who fills in for a maternity leave, and \u201cThe Boyfriend,\u201d about a woman doubting her new relationship.",
      "She says her books all have a connective tissue \u2014\u00a0beyond the unexpected twists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the wealth divide. That gulf between the very, very rich and those who are struggling just to keep afloat, and how unfair all that is,\u201d she says.",
      "\"It bothers me more and more and more as we go on. It\u2019s just heading so far in one direction It\u2019s actually quite terrifying,\" she says."

      "Meanwhile, M\u00e4rtha Louise faced scrutiny for managing an alternative therapy center that taught clairvoyance and how to speak to angels, per Reuters.",
      "Verrett says he and M\u00e4rtha Louise are \u201cvery spiritual people.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe believe in God, we believe in spirit and we believe in the ancestors,\u201d he says.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, the couple guesses as to why their relationship has encountered criticism.",
      "\u201cWhen people criticize us about these things, I think it just shows their own limitations,\u201d M\u00e4rtha Louise says.",
      "\u201cPeople are not used to someone of her stature being with a shaman. There\u2019re a lot of things that people just can\u2019t wrap their minds around because they\u2019re stuck,\u201d Verrett adds.",
      "Following the criticism, M\u00e4rtha Louise ultimately made a decision to step back from her royal duties in 2022.",
      "She tells TODAY.com this was an \u201cimportant choice to make to separate us from the rest of the family, so that we can live our lives and not everything is pulled into the rest of the family\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "The documentary also unpacks how race may play into Verrett\u2019s reception into Norwegian culture. In the film, Verrett shows racist comments he\u2019s received online.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re still even on that on the planet,\u201d he says about the messages.",
      "In 2022, M\u00e4rtha Louise\u2019s parents, King Harald V and Queen Sonja, condemned the \"racist attitudes\" that Verrett faced part of the larger statement about M\u00e4rtha Louise stepping back from royal duties.",
      "Reflecting on that moment, Verrett started to get emotional. \u201cYou want to bring me to tears?\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cTo see them so courageously step forward and say something that has never been said in the history of any monarchy \u2014 I have to say that I have so much respect for her family, for how they are willing to look at things and talk them out and be able to come to a place where we can stay honorable as a family, but also at the same time, support and love one another,\u201d he says.",
      "The couple hopes their documentary shows \"love conquers all.\"",
      "\u201cI think that what we are demonstrating is to live unapologetically, live in the truth that we are authentically and to not let other people step into that space and dictate with their opinions against the love that you truly have because like my wife said, love does conquer all,\u201d Verrett says.",
      "\u201cAnd also being authentic and truthful to who you are,\u201d M\u00e4rtha Louise adds. \u201cLike, isn\u2019t that the reason why we\u2019re here on this planet? And if that\u2019s being rebellious or being authentic, then I\u2019m all for it.\""

      "In a television machine as long-running as \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d it\u2019s not unusual for an actor to play a minor character and later join the cast in a different role. What is unusual is a guest character returning seasons later in a full-time role \u2014 as captain. Just ask \u201cLaw & Order: SVU\u201d star Aim\u00e9 Donna Kelly, who was promoted to series regular ahead of Season 27.",

I think it was a great introduction to this character who is strong but also extremely empathetic and just someone that fights for truth and justice.\u201d",

      "\u201cShe does not like people that take shortcuts or that try to skirt the rules, and then she meets Benson, who kind of toes that line,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd Benson teaches her that there\u2019s a time and a place, right? \u2026 And there\u2019s a reason why you kind of have to push back against authority a little bit.",
      "\u201cAnd I think for Curry that\u2019s nerve-wracking but also exciting because it\u2019s in the pursuit of justice.\u201d",
      "Getting to work with Mariska and learn from her, I think you\u2019re seeing kind of a reflection of that in these two characters. Like, Curry learned so much from Benson, and me, Aim\u00e9, I\u2019m learning so much from Mariska. So, it just translates really well on screen.",

    "story": [
      "Reese Witherspoon says she was deterred from pursuing one particular type of role toward the beginning of her career, despite having firsthand experience in the subject matter.",
      "Witherspoon spoke to The New York Times in a recent interview, reflecting on the period of her career after she became a mother when she was 23.",
      "The actor welcomed two children with her then-husband, Ryan Phillippe: daughter Ava in 1999 and son Deacon in 2003.",
      "When asked if it was difficult to navigate motherhood while her peers were not in the same stage of life, Witherspoon shared the \u201cironic\u201d advice she was given about her career.",
      "\u201cI was always being told by people in the industry: \u2018Don\u2019t play a mom. It\u2019ll make you seem old,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018But, I am a mom.\u2019 There was so much about our business that desexualized you, so you couldn\u2019t be a movie star if you played a mom. And thank goodness, that\u2019s sort of going by the wayside.\u201d",
      "Witherspoon added, \u201cBut that was a big part of when I was in my 20s and 30s: Don\u2019t play a mom. No men will desire you, or nobody will want to go see that movie because nobody wants to see a movie about a mom.\u201d",
      "The \u201cLegally Blonde\u201d star also opened up about her experience becoming a mom in her early 20s.",
      "\u201cThere was so much I didn\u2019t know,\" she said. \"And maybe that na\u00efvet\u00e9 was good, because it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll just do that and have a career.\u2019\u201d",
      "Witherspoon said some people would tell her that becoming a mom would \u201cbe really hard on your career,\u201d adding, \u201cThere were roles I couldn\u2019t take. I had to have this immediate balance of family and career, being a mom and being a working actress.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why it was also scary when \u2018Legally Blonde\u2019 became such a big hit,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to beg for parts; parts were coming to me. And that almost made it scarier, because I wasn\u2019t picking and choosing what I would reach and strive for. It was more like, what will I not do?\u201d",
      "Witherspoon, who later welcomed son Tennessee with her ex-husband Jim Toth in 2012, has since portrayed a mom on screen several times, including in the movies \u201cHome Again\u201d and \u201cYour Place or Mine\u201d and the shows \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d and \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere.\u201d",
      "In recent months, Witherspoon has opened up about her role as a mom off-screen, including how she has raised three children in Hollywood.",
      "Witherspoon shared a post on Instagram in August that featured several throwback photos posing with her children over the years. On the first slide, she wrote, \u201cSomeone asked me what raising three kids and building a career in Hollywood looked like\u2026\u201d",
      "\u201cIt looked like spending a lot of time in trailers together,\u201d she added. \u201cIt looked like always being on the road together. It looked like my kids constantly giving me career advice!\u201d",
      "The actor also highlighted some of the difficult aspects, writing, \u201cIt looked really hard sometimes. I\u2019d cry working 14 to 17 hours, sometimes all night long and still woke up early for carpool. I was deliriously tired.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt looked like trying to say something positive about my work when I got home at night,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo my kids would know that my work was meaningful to me and could be fun!\u201d",
      "Witherspoon said that while it could be \u201cchallenging at times,\u201d being a mom has given her \u201cperspective about what was important in life.\u201d",
      "\u201cNothing was better than getting to come home and hug them and hear about their day!\u201d she said."

      "The question hanging over an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday is how exactly the alliance will respond.",
      "As NATO struggles to turn alarm into action, officials and analysts urged a more forceful response and warned that hesitation risks emboldening  Russian President Vladimir Putin. But questions about U.S. support, escalation risks and what this growing threat means for Ukraine remain unresolved.",
      "Estonia, which called for the Security Council meeting after three Russian MiG-31 fighter aircraft entered its airspace for 12 minutes without permission last week, pressed members to address what it described as a \u201cblatant, reckless, and flagrant violation of NATO airspace\u201d and Russia\u2019s \u201crepeated violations of international law.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s actions \u201cundermine principles vital to the security of all U.N. member states,\u201d Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said Sunday on X.",
      "Claims that Russia violated Estonian airspace were \"baseless\" and \"aimed at escalating tensions,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, adding that Russia operated within international regulations.",
      "So far, NATO\u2019s response has largely been limited to meeting rooms as Moscow's probing exposes a contrast between European leaders\u2019 urgent calls for action and President Donald Trump\u2019s more muted response.",
      "Asked by reporters Sunday whether Washington would come to the defense of Poland and the Baltic states if Russia attacks, Trump said: \"Yeah I would.\"",
      "And on Monday Mike Walz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said at Security Council meeting that the events left \u201cthe impression either Russia wants to escalate or doesn\u2019t have full control of its fighter planes and drones.\u201d Either scenario, he said, was \u201cvery disconcerting.\u201d",
      "The U.S. \u201cwill defend every inch of NATO territory,\u201d he said, adding that he expected \u201cRussia to seek ways to de escalate, not risk expansion.\u201d",
      "At the same meeting, Britain\u2019s foreign minister, Yvette Cooper, also warned that Russia\u2019s incursions into NATO territory risked triggering an armed conflict.",
      "\u201cYour reckless actions risk direct armed confrontation between NATO and Russia. Our alliance is defensive, but be under no illusion: We stand ready to defend NATO\u2019s skies and NATO\u2019s territory,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we need to confront planes operating in NATO space without permission then we will do so.\u201d",
      "That drew an immediate rebuke from Moscow, which dismissed Europe\u2019s concerns as groundless and hysterical.",
      "NATO's response to this ratcheting Russian activity amounts to the launch of operation \"Eastern Sentry\" earlier this month to bolster the defense of Europe\u2019s eastern flank in response to a series of Russian drone incursions over Poland.",
      "After Germany and Sweden scrambled fighter jets Sunday to intercept and track a Russian surveillance plane flying unidentified over the Baltic Sea, one regional leader said Russia was not just testing NATO\u2019s response, but was also aiming to reduce support for Ukraine by compelling countries to redirect resources.",

      "Ukraine has also submitted a request to attend the Security Council meeting and present its position.",
      "But Europe's security will require decisive action, and that will not happen at a Security Council meeting, \u201cfor the very simple reason that Russia has a veto on the council,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank",
      "Unable to rely on Trump\u2019s \u201cshifting position\u201d on Russia, Giles told NBC News, the \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 European nations that say they are prepared to underwrite security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 must become the \u201ccoalition of the able and actually doing something.\u201d",
      "Poland will not hesitate to shoot down objects that violate its airspace and pose a threat, its prime minister said Monday. But, he said, his country would take a more cautious approach when dealing with situations that are less clear-cut, and would need to know it had its allies' support.",
      "\"You really need to think twice before deciding on actions that could trigger a very acute phase of conflict,\u201d Donald Tusk told a news conference.",

      "The summit, convened by France and Saudi Arabia, comes after the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Portugal all announced their formal recognition of the state of Palestine on Sunday, with several other nations expected to follow suit at the United Nations General Assembly this week.",
      "These Western powers may be hoping to breathe new life into the idea as a way to resolve the conflict, but Israel's hard-line government has instead vowed to retaliate while pressing ahead with its deadly assault on Gaza City that has forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon said both Israel and the U.S. would boycott Monday's summit, branding it a \"circus.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decried the moves as a \"huge reward to terrorism\" and vowed there \"will be no Palestinian state.\"",

      "Hopes for a two-state solution have dwindled in the midst of Israel's nearly two-year offensive in Gaza \u2014 and as efforts to negotiate a ceasefire to end the war and free the remaining hostages have repeatedly failed.",
      "Palestinian statehood, which would see an internationally recognized state in territories seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War, is now formally recognized by around 75% of U.N. member countries. But that recognition remains largely symbolic.",
      "Gershon Baskin, an Israeli who has acted as a mediator with Hamas for decades and a staunch advocate of a two-state solution, said that he welcomed the growing recognition. But without further action, including sanctions against Israel, he said the move will do little to \"change the lives of Palestinians\" on the ground.",
      "\"It's really a step in the right direction,\" Baskin said in a phone interview Monday of the summit at the General Assembly. But, calling Israel's offensive in Gaza \"a genocide,\" he said, \"the most important thing now ... is to end the war in Gaza and that comes before everything else.\"",
      "It is unclear how effective Monday\u2019s summit will be in advancing efforts to end the war in the face of furious opposition from Israel and the U.S., which blocked Palestinian officials from even attending the U.N. gathering.",
      "Baskin noted the possibility of retaliation from Israel in response to the diplomatic moves by France, the U.K. and others, with far-right members of Netanyahu's government pushing for the annexation of part of the occupied West Bank.",

      "\"We're trying to get it back,\" Trump said of Bagram during a news conference Thursday alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that capped a whirlwind state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "Taking aim at the Biden administration's fraught withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as a \"total disaster,\" Trump criticized the decision to relinquish Bagram Airfield, which quickly fell under the control of the Taliban as they swept back into power in 2021.",
      "\"We gave it to them for nothing,\" said Trump, who has long criticized the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"We want that base back,\" he said.",
      "About an hour's drive north of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, Bagram served for years as a crucial hub in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. At its peak around 2012, the sprawling airfield saw more than 100,000 U.S. troops pass through its compound.",
      "Late Thursday, Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Afghan Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea of Bagram returning to the U.S.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan and the U.S. need to interact with each other and can have economic and political relations based on mutual respect and common interests,\u201d Jalaly said on the social platform X. \u201cThe Afghans have not accepted a military presence in history, and this possibility was completely rejected during the Doha talks and agreement, but the door is open for further interaction.\u201d",
      "Trump made clear at least one motivating factor for his interest in reclaiming Bagram, noting its proximity to rival superpower China.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\u201d Trump said during his comments Thursday, which came a day before he was spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid ongoing trade negotiations.",
      "Addressing journalists later on Air Force One, Trump said Bagram was \"one of the most powerful bases in the world in terms of runway strength and length,\" adding: \"You could land anything there.\" He emphasized again that the base was \"an hour away from where they make their missiles \u2014 China.\"",
      "Addressing Trump's comments Friday, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China \"respects Afghanistan\u2019s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.",
      "\"Afghanistan\u2019s future should be decided by its own people,\" Lin said, adding: \"Stirring up tension and creating confrontation in the region won\u2019t be popular.\"",
      "China, which has made strides in rapidly expanding its nuclear stockpile, is estimated to have accumulated about 600 warheads, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.",
      "Of course, greater surveillance on China wouldn't be the only advantage to regaining Bagram.",
      "A presence at the base could also aid in regional counterterrorism efforts, among other factors that could appeal to Trump.",
      "It remains unclear to what extent, if any, the U.S. has been in talks with the Taliban on the future of Bagram.",
      "\u201cEven if the Taliban considered this, China most certainly would do everything it can to entice the Taliban to keep the U.S. out of Afghanistan and has far more leverage and enticements to make this happen,\" Bill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, cautioned in comments shared online Thursday.",
      "\"The Trump administration should be very careful not to grant the Taliban concessions only to be prevented access to Bagram in the end,\" he said.",
      "The Taliban have been working to rehabilitate their global standing, with the militant group freeing American George Glezmann, a Delta Air Lines mechanic, in March amid efforts to normalize relations between Afghanistan and the U.S.",
      "On Friday, the Taliban also released British couple Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband, Peter Reynolds, 80, who were detained by the Interior Ministry in February, according to Sky News, NBC News' sister outlet in the United Kingdom.",
      "Trump's comments came as the Pentagon continues to push ahead with a review into the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans were killed at Kabul's airport in a bombing by the Islamic State terrorist group.",
      "Trump, who began the process for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during his first term, has been a fierce critic of the Biden administration's handling of the drawdown.",
      "The White House under President Joe Biden largely blamed the Trump administration for the chaotic withdrawal, with a National Security Council report released in 2023 arguing that Biden's options for executing the operation were \"severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor.\""

      "The words of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk \u2014 the first president of an independent Czechoslovakia, which has since split into Czechia and Slovakia \u2014 were unveiled in a live broadcast attended by current Czech President Petr Pavel.",
      "Speculation had gone into overdrive prior to the announcement, with experts wondering whether Masaryk may have conveyed a fateful warning before Europe's descent back into war. His words are believed to have been dictated to his son Jan, surviving both World War II and subsequent communist rule.",
      "Jan\u2019s former secretary handed the envelope to the National Archives in 2005 on the condition that it not be opened for another 20 years.",
      "Even the Masaryk family did not know what mystery the white envelope contained. But when it was opened early Friday, it still managed to surprise.",
      "Inside was another yellow envelope, containing five pages of handwritten notes in Czech and English (Masaryk's wife, Charlotte Garrigue, was born in the United States.)",
      "Rather than a final message before his death in 1937, experts assessed that the message was instead dictated three years earlier.",
      "\u201cI am ill, seriously ill \u2014 it is the end, but I am not afraid. You will continue the work, you know how, but you must be careful. You know how to behave; I don\u2019t need to tell you anything more,\u201d the letter read, according to the country's official broadcaster.",
      "At the time, Masaryk was gravely ill after a stroke, and those around him thought his days were numbered.",
      "Masaryk became the first president of Czechoslovakia in 1918 after it declared independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was defeated in World War I. He served until 1935. Jan became foreign minister at the end of World War II, until his sudden death in 1948.",
      "In the envelope, Masaryk talked extensively about his death and subsequent funeral and reflected on the complex political situation in the ethnically diverse country.",
      "As well as derisive comments about a Slovak politician, he urged keeping the German minority part of the state. \u201cGive them what they deserve, but no more,\u201d he said of the Germans, according to the state broadcaster.",
      "\u201c[This was a] crucial time in Czechoslovakia with Hitler just coming to power in Germany,\u201d said Mark Cornwall, an emeritus professor of modern European history at the University of Southampton in England.",
      "\u201cIt was a very turbulent period in Europe about what was going to happen,\u201d said Cornwall, nodding to the Nazis' subsequent annexation of the Sudetenland, a Czech region that had a significant German-speaking population, and the later outbreak of World War II.",
      "\u201cMasaryk is still very revered\u201d in the country, Cornwall told NBC News in a telephone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t think of an American equivalent. Perhaps he\u2019s George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.\u201d"

      "The statehood acknowledgements were \u201ca diplomatic disaster,\u201d Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, a long-standing opponent of Netanyahu, posted on X on Sunday. He added that it was \u201ca harmful step\u201d and a \u201creward for terror.\u201d",

      "British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC that she had warned the Israelis against annexing all or part of the West Bank.",

      "Israel may also decide to shutter France\u2019s consulate in Jerusalem, which tends to deal with issues related to the Palestinians, the reports said.

      "The deadliest attack on the press recorded by the CPJ was the 2009 Maguindanao massacre in the Philippines, in which 32 journalists were among those killed when a convoy was ambushed."

      "Canada had, moments before, become the first Group of 7 nation to recognize the state of Palestine, as Prime Minister Mark Carney promised a \"peaceful future for both the State of Palestine and the State of Israel.\"",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese released a statement shortly after formally recognizing \"the independent and sovereign State of Palestine.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement: \u201cWe will have to fight both at the UN and in all other arenas against the false propaganda against us and the calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state that will endanger our existence and constitute an absurd reward for terrorism. The international community will hear from us on this matter in the coming days.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu accused the foreign leaders of giving Hamas a \u201cprize.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will not happen,\u201d he said. \u201cA Palestinian state will not be established west of the Jordan River.\u201d",
      "The Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement on X that it \u201ccategorically rejects\u201d the declarations by the United Kingdom and other countries.",
      "\u201cThis declaration does not promote peace, but on the contrary \u2014 further destabilizes the region and undermines the chances of achieving a peaceful solution in the future,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Hamas applauded the decision, calling it a \u201crightful outcome of our people\u2019s struggle, steadfastness, and sacrifices on the path to liberation and return.\u201d",
      "The move, which is largely symbolic, grants the Palestinians increased diplomatic standing and the potential for treaty-making.",
      "But it does not fundamentally change the realities on the ground in the Gaza Strip, where the humanitarian crisis continues to worsen after nearly two years of war, or the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians have come under increasing pressure from Jewish settlers and the military.",
      "More than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, including thousands of children, according to the local Palestinian Health Ministry, with much of the territory destroyed and the majority of the population driven from their homes, often multiple times.",
      "Israeli strikes killed at least 34 people in Gaza City overnight, health officials said Sunday, as Israel pressed ahead with its offensive in the enclave's most populous city, where hundreds of thousands of people have been living under famine.",
      "It is against that backdrop that a growing list of countries, many of them traditional backers of Israel, have said they will recognize Palestine.",
      "The U.K. said in July it would recognize Palestine as a state unless the Israeli government \u201ctakes substantive steps to end the appalling situation\" in Gaza, and its official recognition comes amid mounting international criticism of Israel over the war in the enclave.",
      "\u201cIn the face of the growing horror in the Middle East, we are acting to keep alive the possibility of peace and of a two-state solution,\" Starmer said. \u201cThat means a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state \u2014 at the moment we have neither.\u201d",
      "Britain's decision has angered its close ally Israel, as well as the United States, which argues that recognition emboldens extremists and rewards Hamas, the group that led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, marking a major escalation in the decadeslong conflict.",
      "Recognition of a Palestinian state is \u201cnothing but a reward for jihadist Hamas \u2014 emboldened by its Muslim Brotherhood affiliated in the U.K.,\u201d Israel\u2019s foreign ministry said on X.",
      "\u201cHamas leaders themselves openly admit: this recognition is a direct outcome, the \u2018fruit\u2019 for the 7 October massacre,\u201d it said.",
      "The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, a group representing hostage families, condemned the decision to recognize a Palestinian state while \"turning a blind eye\" to the hostages who remain in captivity.",
      "\"We believe that any discussion about recognizing a Palestinian state must be contingent upon the immediate release of all hostages,\" it said in a statement Sunday.",
      "Starmer said recognition was \"not a reward for Hamas,\" because it means Hamas can have no future, and no role in government. Albanese also said Hamas must have \"no role in Palestine.\"",
      "The U.K.'s recognition is part of a wider shift among U.S. allies, bringing them closer to the more than 140 out of 193 U.N. member states that have already recognized Palestine as a state.",
      "France is expected to formally declare its recognition Monday at a United Nations conference in New York co-chaired with Saudi Arabia, coinciding with the start of the General Assembly.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday on Israeli television Channel 12 that nations \u201chave to recognize the legitimate right of Palestinian people to have a state.\u201d",
      "He also denounced Israel's new ground offensive in Gaza City as \"absolutely unacceptable\" and \"a huge mistake.\"",
      "Portugal also confirmed Saturday it would recognize a Palestinian state Sunday.",
      "Other countries on the brink of recognition include Belgium, Portugal, Luxembourg and New Zealand, which are likely to act either immediately before or at the U.N. special conference on a two-state solution in New York on Monday.",
      "Spain, Norway and Ireland recognized a state of Palestine last year.",
      "The creation of a Palestinian state refers to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel occupies both the West Bank and Gaza, meaning the Palestinian Authority is not in full control of its land or people.",
      "Israeli authorities recently approved a new settlement project that ultranationalist lawmakers see as a death knell for dreams of Palestinian statehood."

      "A series of unprecedented Russian incursions into NATO members' airspace in recent weeks has raised the alarm across Europe, which is looking towards an emboldened Kremlin for clues to its intentions and next moves.",
      "The incidents have also exposed a contrast between European leaders' urgent calls for action and President Donald Trump's more muted response, as he continues to hold back on imposing additional sanctions on Moscow as its war on Ukraine rages on.",
      "On Friday, for the second time in 10 days, a NATO ally invoked Article 4 following airspace violations linked to Russia \u2014 a mechanism that prompts urgent talks among allies and that had only been triggered seven times in its 76-year history before this month.",
      "Earlier in the day, three MiG-31 fighter aircraft entered Estonian airspace without permission and remained there for a total of 12 minutes, according to the country's Ministry of Defense. NATO aircraft intercepted the jets, the military alliance\u2019s spokesperson Allison Hart said.",
      "Estonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna called the incursion \"unprecedentedly brazen,\" saying Russia had already violated its airspace four times this year.",
      "It was \u201can extremely dangerous provocation,\u201d added Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief.",
      "Russia denied violating Estonian airspace, saying aircraft were making a scheduled flight from from Russia to Kaliningrad, an exclave wedged between Poland and Lithuania, that was conducted in \u201cstrict compliance\u201d with international regulations.",
      "While European leaders have responded with urgency, signaling deep concern and pushing for stronger measures on Moscow amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, President Donald Trump has struck a more restrained note as he continues to hold back on imposing further sanctions on the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t love it,\u201d Trump said Friday on the latest incursion. \u201cI don\u2019t like when that happens. Could be big trouble.\u201d",
      "Although Trump has expressed frustration and disappointment with Putin, saying on Thursday that the Russian leader \u201chas let me down,\u201d relations with the Kremlin have warmed dramatically during this administration.",
      "Trump has also been unwilling to impose further sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, despite repeated threats.",

      "Estonia and the United States are members of NATO, which at its core is a mutual defense pact formed after World War II to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union, meaning an attack on one may be considered an attack on all.",

      "Trump, again, offered a more muted response, saying the suspected incursion \"could have been a mistake.\"",
      "His acting U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dorothy Shea, sought to reassure allies. Violating the airspace of a U.S. ally, \u201cintentionally or otherwise,\u201d showed \u201cimmense disrespect for good-faith U.S. efforts to bring an end to this conflict,\u201d she told the U.N. Security Council.",
      "\"Rest assured, we will defend every inch of NATO territory,\" she added.",
      "Moscow has not commented on the Romanian claims.",

      "\u201cIf the West hesitates, Russia will keep testing, probing, and collecting data on our response,\u201d he told NBC News via email. \u201cEvery incursion is a rehearsal. Unless we act decisively now, we are training Moscow to believe NATO is predictable, divided, and slow.\u201d",
      "The divergence between Europe's urgent stance and Trump's restraint comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed Washington for stronger measures, who has urged Trump to take a clearer position on Moscow.",
      "\"If the war continues and there are no movements towards peace, we expect sanctions,\" he told reporters Friday evening, adding that he expects Trump to take such actions.",

    "story": [
      "Perhaps the Eurovision ban is starting to bite, because three years after Russia was booted from the beloved song contest following the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it is reviving a Soviet-era version of the camp competition.",
      "The Intervision Song Contest will see 23 artists from around the world \u2014 including one representing the U.S. \u2014 offer a heady mix of musical styles, from moody Belarusian pop to Colombian folk and high-energy Vietnamese rap at an arena in the capital of Moscow on Saturday night.",
      "Unlike the Eurovision Song Contest, which mainly includes European countries and a few others like Australia and Israel, Intervision bills itself as a truly global event by offering artists from countries around the world, including those in the Global South, a chance to compete for the top prize of 30 million rubles (roughly $360,000).",
      "\u201cBack in the Soviet times, the government would decide to promote a positive image of Russia abroad. We need to promote an objective image. We want to be known with all our merits and shortcomings,\u201d Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a news conference this week in response to a presubmitted question from NBC News.",
      "Asked whether Russia was using the competition as an exercise in soft power, he replied, \u201cIf by soft power you mean the opportunity to let people know about us, then of course we\u2019re interested in this.\u201d",
      "A pop phenomenon drawing around 160 million viewers each May, Eurovision began at the height of the Cold War in 1956 as a technical experiment to try and broadcast a simultaneous program across the member stations of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).",
      "A divided continent had mirror organizations like the NATO defense alliance in Western Europe and the Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe, and the EBU in the West matched by the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT) on the other side of the Iron Curtain.",
      "In answer to Eurovision came Intervision, which was broadcast by the OIRT on several occasions between 1965 and 1980, with contests held in what was then Czechoslovakia and later in Poland.",
      "But Dean Vuletic, who has written and edited books on Eurovision and led a research project on Intervision, says Russia is getting its history wrong with the relaunch, \u201cpresenting Intervision as something that was Russian- or Soviet-led, but it actually wasn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said, the competitions \u201cweren\u2019t that focused on the Soviet participants,\u201d although they had to be invited. Having studied the archives of Czech and Polish TV stations, he said it was \u201castonishing how critical they are of the Soviet participants.\u201d",
      "He added that it was actually created during a period of liberalization in an attempt \u201cto promote East-West cooperation in popular music and television,\u201d and Western performers like Gloria Gaynor were invited to perform in the intervals. Performers from Eastern Europe were also hoping to be signed by Western labels, he added.",
      "Before it was kicked out in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia was frequently a top-10 finalist at Eurovision, which Vuletic called \u201ca huge platform for cultural diplomacy for any country,\u201d big or small.",
      "The country\u2019s leaders \u201csaw it as a very prestigious cultural project and one which could reach a huge amount of people,\u201d he added.",
      "But Eurovision\u2019s embrace of LGBTQ rights drew the ire of conservative Russian lawmakers and the country\u2019s Orthodox Church, particularly after the 2014 victory of bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst.",
      "Saturday\u2019s Intervision contest is getting a full-court press promotion from organizers, who have drafted a series of celebrity \u201cambassadors\u201d to get the word out. Among them are Dima Bilan, a Russian singer who won Eurovision in 2008, and Alexander Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals hockey star, who holds the record for most goals scored in NHL history.",
      "The goal is to \u201cpromote universal, spiritual, family, cultural, ethical, and religious traditions of different nations,\u201d according to the competition\u2019s website, although that seems potentially at odds with the entrant representing the U.S., Vassy, who has a history of performing at Pride events and supporting LGBTQ rights.",
      "Vassy, an Australian-born singer living in Los Angeles, has been a vocalist on dance tracks from David Guetta and Ti\u00ebsto, while several of her own topped Billboard\u2019s Dance Club Songs chart in the 2010s.",
      "The 42-year-old, whose real name is Vasiliki Karagiorgos, was a last-minute addition to the contest after the previous selection pulled out due to \u201cunforeseen family circumstances.\u201d",
      "Her outlook is markedly different from that of Russia\u2019s entrant, Shaman, who mixes politics and pop and rose in popularity after he became a strident supporter of the war in Ukraine.",
      "So vocal is his backing of the Kremlin that he has ended up on Australian and European Union sanction lists.",
      "Russia will be hoping that Shaman\u2019s popularity can bring a younger audience to the contest as well as his fans, many of whom are based outside major Russian metropolises like Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to Yulia Yurtaeva-Martens, a researcher at the Free University of Berlin who has written a book on Intervision.",
      "With his fulsome embrace of Russian nationalism in his music and performances, Shaman is viewed by the government as \u201ca new political symbol for new audiences,\u201d according to Yurtaeva-Martens, adding that it was unlikely they would have chosen anyone else because he \u201cwas the best choice for the Russian government.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Kenya\u2019s Sanaipei Tande is competing with her song \u201cFlavour,\u201d an Afropop tune that mixes English and Kiswahili.",
      "In between rehearsals in Moscow, she said in a Zoom interview this week that she hadn\u2019t heard of Intervision before this year and was only really familiar with Eurovision because 2011\u2019s contest had featured Norwegian-Kenyan singer Stella Mwangi.",
      "For artists who may have had success at home, performing at Intervision is a chance to step onto a larger stage, she said. In her case, this is both metaphorically and literally true because \u201cthe live arena is so huge.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any stage in my country that\u2019s this big,\u201d she said, adding that coming to the Russian capital \u201cto compete against other international artists \u2014 that, for me, has put me on a whole new level.\u201d",
      "The fact she had been selected and was representing Kenya was a victory in itself, she said.",
      "\u201cI mean, $300,000 wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing to add on to that,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut just being here and being able to perform on this stage and experiencing things on a whole new level, that already is a win.\u201d"

    "summary": "President Donald Trump is set to speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday as they try to finalize a deal to keep the popular short-video app TikTok operating in the United States.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 President Donald Trump said that he had made progress on several issues with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a call Friday morning, including on the \u201capproval of the TikTok deal,\u201d and that he plans to meet with Xi in person this fall and in China early next year.",
      "Trump summarized their conversation, which he said began at 8 a.m. ET, in a Truth Social post in which he said he appreciates \u201cthe TikTok approval,\u201d but stopped short of announcing any kind of finalized deal. As expected, the call also appeared to touch on the ongoing trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",
      "\u201cI just completed a very productive call with President Xi of China. We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "For more on this story, listen to \u2018Here\u2019s the Scoop,\u2019 a daily evening podcast that brings you a fresh take on the day\u2019s top stories in 15 minutes or less.",
      "Trump said that he agreed with Xi that they would meet at the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 APEC summit in South Korea, that Trump would go to China early next year, and that Xi would eventually come to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!\u201d the president wrote.",
      "The White House is not disputing the characterization that there is no final TikTok deal. An announcement on a final deal would ultimately come from the president, a White House official said.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Friday afternoon, Trump offered some mixed messages on the status of TikTok talks. He said Xi \"approved the TikTok deal,\" and then said \"we look forward to getting that deal closed.\"",
      "Asked directly if the deal was fully approved, Trump said, \"Well, I think so. I mean \u2014 when you say fully approved, I don\u2019t know what that means. We have to get, we have to get it signed. I guess it could be a formality.\"",
      "He added that \"the TikTok deal is well on its way.\"",
      "Separately, Chinese state media said Trump and Xi had a \u201ccandid and in-depth exchange of views\u201d and that the call was \u201cpragmatic, positive, and constructive.\u201d Xi said the U.S. should avoid taking restrictive trade measures \u201cto prevent undermining the outcomes achieved through multiple rounds of consultations,\u201d according to a readout published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "On TikTok, Xi said the Chinese government \u201crespects the will of companies and is pleased to see companies conduct business negotiations on the basis of market rules and reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance interests,\u201d the readout said.",
      "\u201cWe hope the U.S. side will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies investing in the United States,\u201d it said.",
      "In a statement, TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, thanked Xi and Trump \u201cfor their efforts to preserve TikTok in the United States\u201d and said it will \u201cwork in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.\u201d",
      "Friday's call was the first between Trump and Xi since June, when Trump said they had spoken for about 90 minutes in a discussion focused on trade.",
      "At the height of trade tensions in April, U.S. and Chinese tariff rates reached as high as 145%, in what amounted to a mutual trade embargo. Since then they have been lowered under another \u201cframework\u201d deal, with new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods capped at 30%, while China imposes a 10% additional tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "The lower tariff rates are set to expire on Nov. 10 unless a deal is reached or the trade truce is extended again.",
      "The two countries also continue to tussle over export controls on strategically important products such as rare earths, which China has a near-monopoly over, and U.S. chip technology.",
      "TikTok, which is estimated to have about 170 million active users in the U.S., faces a ban unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, agrees to sell the app\u2019s U.S. assets to U.S. owners. The sale is required under a law Congress passed last year, citing national security concerns.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump formally extended the deadline for a TikTok deal for a fourth time, until Dec. 16, a day after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Beijing and Washington had struck a \u201cframework\u201d for an agreement, without providing details such as who would be taking over TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "Trump has gone back and forth on the ban, but he credits TikTok with helping him win last year\u2019s presidential election and has expressed concern about alienating its huge and youthful user base. He said Thursday during a visit to the U.K. that the app \u201chas tremendous value\u201d and that \u201cvery rich people and companies are going to be owning it.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have said the TikTok sale is necessary because of Chinese laws that require Chinese companies to share data requested by the government. They also cite concerns about data collection and the algorithm the app uses to recommend content to users, which they say is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese officials.",
      "TikTok denies sharing user data with Chinese authorities and says the U.S. has never provided evidence of Beijing trying to manipulate the algorithm.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance say the powerful algorithm, which has helped fuel the app\u2019s global success, is proprietary and thus difficult to sell to a U.S. company under Chinese law.",
      "There are concerns that TikTok may continue to use the Chinese algorithm in the U.S.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., the committee\u2019s ranking member, have both expressed opposition to any deal that keeps the algorithm under Chinese control or allows ByteDance to maintain an operational relationship with the new American TikTok.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has all the leverage he needs to strike a deal that saves TikTok and complies with the law \u2014 which means making sure TikTok\u2019s data and algorithm are truly in American hands,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Any deal would most likely need to be approved by Congress as well as ByteDance\u2019s board.",
      "Compared with five years ago, when Trump first called for a ban during his first term, TikTok is more mature as a platform and less likely to keep growing, said Dimitar Gueorguiev, an associate professor of political science and director of Chinese studies at Syracuse University.",
      "\u201cTikTok is, I think, a less valuable bargaining chip from the Chinese perspective, and an easier concession,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, for the United States, it\u2019s as visible and kind of politically salient as ever.\u201d",
      "While the details of the TikTok deal remain unclear, Gueorguiev said, the broader question is \u201ccan the Trump administration, as well as their counterparts in Beijing, convert on whatever progress we observe today and keep it going\u201d to achieve a \u201clarger bargain\u201d between the U.S. and China.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re thinking about what is the ultimate outcome of this, and who wins and who loses, there\u2019s still a lot to be told,\u201d he said."

      "Leaders in northern Germany are appalled after a shop owner posted an antisemitic sign banning Jewish people in a store window.",
      "The sign in the store in Flensburg read, \u201cJews are banned from entering here!!!!\u201d in German, according to a joint statement from the Minister of Culture Dorit Stenke and Gerhard Ulrich, the antisemitism commissioner of the State of Schleswig-Holstein.",
      "\u201cA sign that denies Jews access to a store is a frightening signal and an attack on the principles of our free coexistence,\" Stenke said in the statement. \"We cannot allow such things to continue in our society and must take decisive action against it together. Antisemitism is a threat to our democracy and must not be tolerated in any form.\"",
      "Ulrich filed a criminal complaint for \"incitement of hatred,\" against the shop owner, according to the statement. The officials did not identify the business owner or the type of business.",
      "\"Antisemitic hate speech like this not only hurts those affected, but also disrupts public peace. The Flensburg incident, with its contemptuous rhetoric, is fatally reminiscent of the Nazi hate speech against Jews.\u201d",
      "Antisemitism has been on the rise in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany's northernmost state, according to officials. In 2024, the region saw a 390% increase in antisemitic incidents.",
      "\"We must stand together against every form of antisemitism,\" Ulrich said. \"The fight against antisemitism is a special responsibility that we bear as Germans.\"",
      "Stenke said that \"a state of action plan against antisemitism\" will be adopted next year. The official did not elaborate on what the plan will entail."
