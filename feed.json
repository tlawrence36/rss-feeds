      "\u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things\u201d is the debut story collection of the British author Naomi Wood",
      "Naomi Wood, an English author not yet well known in the U.S., has written three historical novels, including the well-regarded \u201cMrs. Hemingway,\u201d about the four wives of Ernest Hemingway. During the Covid lockdowns, when her kids were confined at home and she had less time to herself, she turned to the short story form. The result, \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things,\u201d is an astonishingly good debut collection that often incorporates the bizarre, life-altering reality of the pandemic into the plots.",
      "The main characters tend to be 30-something women trying to have it all. Kids, relationships, satisfying careers \u2014 the \u201cseductive slipstream of productivity.\u201d They also strive to be good citizens of an ailing planet and have sex with their partners more than once in a blue moon.",
      "In \u201cComorbidities,\u201d which won the 2023 BBC National Short Story Award, a couple with young children tries to spice up their marriage by making a sex tape. In an abundance of caution, the man pauses the action to read up on digital security and adjust his devices. Hours later, when the glow has worn off, the woman has a panic attack, worrying it might somehow end up in the \u201cdeadly slime of the internet.\u201d",
      "Her female protagonists happen to be a lusty bunch, enjoying sex in flavors that some might consider kinky. But once the little ones arrive, everything changes. Fathers might leave, but these mothers wouldn\u2019t dream of it. \u201cThey\u2019re the grand love affair, in the end. The kids. No one else,\u201d says a character in the story \u201cA/A/A/A.\u201d",
      "But don\u2019t think for a minute that they\u2019re selfless or saintly. Feminism has freed them to enter the 21st century labor market and take on high-powered jobs, where they prove to be just as scheming, selfish and manipulative as the men.",
      "\u201cRecently, I had started to notice my bad energy, and I began to follow it, wondering where it would take me,\u201d says the main character in \u201cWedding Day.\u201d And where was that? To a scheme to disrupt her ex-boyfriend\u2019s wedding by insisting he leave the party early to bring their daughter home for her bedtime. But revenge is bittersweet because once he is back in the apartment they used to share, she is overcome with painful memories of their powerful erotic attraction.",
      "For all their flaws \u2014 and they have lots of them \u2014 the women in these delectable stories are insanely fun to be with because they are so fully imagined and true to the way we live now.",

      "NEW YORK -- The new stage musical about Louis Armstrong on Broadway opens with the jazz icon in a rehearsal room alongside an anonymous piano player. Keep an eye on the guy on keys.",
      "Audiences may not know it, but there are actually two Armstrongs onstage at that moment \u2014 the actor playing the great trumpeter and one of his real-life descendants. In an act of casting kismet, the piano player is Brandon Louis Armstrong, the music giant's great-great nephew.",
      "\u201cThat moment always feels like I get to \u2014 as Brandon \u2014 speak to my great-great uncle from beyond,\u201d he says. \u201cI get to just spend a moment in conversation with him and ask if he\u2019s OK and hear his voice.\u201d",
      "The younger Armstrong is making his Broadway debut in \u201cA Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical,\u201d playing multiple parts, including a piano player, a teacher and as an understudy for Louis Armstrong himself.",
      "\u201cI was cautious about how I\u2019d be able to step into this world and connect with part of my family history and my lineage,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful and so thankful and so happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cA Wonderful World\u201d \u2014 starring Tony Award-winner James Monroe Iglehart and sometimes James T. Lane in the title role \u2014 is a stage bio of one of jazz's most influential figures, a musician know for \u201cHello, Dolly,\u201d \u201cCheek to Cheek\u201d and \u201cA Wonderful World.\u201d",
      "The musical looks behind his wide smile to dig into his rise from poverty, his four marriages and battles with racism from the Klansmen of New Orleans to the thugs of Chicago to Hollywood\u2019s bigots. He emerges from it a transcendent force, warts and all.",
      "\u201cThe messaging behind it is that jazz is the choices that we make in between the notes,\u201d says the younger Armstrong. \u201cIt\u2019s not about making the right choice every time. It\u2019s about making a choice and allowing yourself to be present wherever those choices may lead you.\u201d",
      "The younger Armstrong was born and raised in Los Angeles. His home was always filled with music, but no one in his immediate family is a musician or wanted to perform.",
      "\u201cI grew up with a lot of jazz playing in the household, a lot of gospel, a lot of R&B, a lot of hip-hop. My mom was also really big into like '80s hair metal bands and stuff like that,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d go from listening to Motown to like listening to Guns n' Roses and then Kenny Rogers. It just was always a tapestry of music.\u201d",
      "He was enchanted by his high school show choir and got invited to join \u2014 all boys got in because muscles were needed to lift the girls \u2014 and was later stunned by seeing a regional theater production of the classic musical \u201cRagtime.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was so moved by it, I just was like, \u2018I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m the person sweeping the floors when it\u2019s over. I just want to be a part of whatever that is\u2019\u201d he recalls.",
      "He graduated from The American Musical and Dramatic Academy and after some local stage work \u2014 including playing Donkey in \u201cShrek\u201d \u2014 landed on the third national tour of \u201cHamilton,\u201d which kicked off in 2019 in Puerto Rico starring Lin-Manuel Miranda.",
      "Armstrong didn't lean into his family name to get ahead. Press interviews when he broke out didn't even mention his famous pedigree. \u201cI never, surprisingly, thought to ever lead with that,\u201d he says. \u201cIn this particular show, it's inescapable.\u201d",
      "Iglehart, also a co-director, recalls Armstrong walking into the rehearsal room and stating his name. \u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018How cool.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018No, no, I\u2019m related.\u2019\u201d He got the job based on his voice and acting \u2014 not his name.",
      "\u201cWe really did it on talent,\u201d says Iglehart. \u201cI always feel like who's ever the most talented person for the show, that should be who is in it. But then the fact that it was his lineage, we kind of felt that it was like a sign.\u201d",
      "\u201cA Wonderful World\" has been a way to honor not only Louis Armstrong but also Brandon's grandfather, Louis Henry Armstrong, who told stories about his proud lineage and would often pick Brandon up after school blasting jazz music, much to his teenage embarrassment.",
      "\u201cI just think in those moments how unbelievably proud he would be of something like this,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the best kind of therapy every night.\u201d",
      "While there is an actual Armstrong in the cast, fellow actors and creatives haven't pulled Brandon aside to ask him about what Louis would think about a line or a scene. That's because Louis Armstrong left many rich writings about his thoughts.",
      "\u201cSo much of the heartbeat of what it is that our show is beating with \u2014 and I prefer it this way \u2014 is the heartbeat that\u2019s being told through Louis\u2019 voice, as opposed to someone coming in and arbitrarily putting themselves into him,\" the younger Armstrong said.",
      "In addition to the rehearsal piano player, serving in the ensemble and playing the New Orleans music teacher who recognized Louis Armstrong's talent, Brandon knows that one day he will be asked to go on as his great-great uncle.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern I think when it happens is just trying not to cry all the way through the show,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cSomehow the universe has paved out this road for me that has landed me here, getting to literally take the stage and carry that baton.\"",

      "\u201cDead Air: The Night that Orson Welles Terrified America\u201d by William Elliott Hazelgrove is a history of the 1938 radio adaptation of \u201cWar of the Worlds.\u201d",
      "Long before Donald Trump used the term \u201cfake news\u201d to complain about coverage he didn't like, Orson Welles mastered the art of actual fake news.",
      "Welles' 1938 radio adaptation of H.G. Wells' \u201cThe War of the Worlds\u201d is the focus of William Elliott Hazelgrove's \u201cDead Air: The Night That Orson Welles Terrified America.\u201d",
      "The book serves as an enjoyable history of the radio drama, with a fair share of fascinating details about its production and historical context. But it falls short on exploring the legendary reports of mass hysteria among listeners who believed they were hearing an actual Martian invasion unfold.",
      "In appropriately cinematic detail, Hazelgrove chronicles Welles' rise and manic working style \u2014 even including a hilarious account of a scuffle that broke out between Welles and Ernest Hemingway and ended with the pair toasting each other over whiskey.",
      "The book highlights what made Welles' production particularly powerful, airing at a time when millions remained unemployed from the Great Depression and the nation was on edge about the threat of Nazi Germany. He details how Welles took advantage of those fears, including using an actor who sounded like Franklin D. Roosevelt for a part in his broadcast.",
      "\u201cA bottled-up sense of panic was in the air and people could almost smell the fear,\" he writes. \u201cOrson Welles would open that bottle and let the fear run wild.\u201d",
      "The book's biggest flaw is Hazelgrove's exploration of just how wild that fear ran. Hazelgrove too easily dismisses the modern reappraisal that reports of a widespread panic were exaggerated, and shows little skepticism about news accounts from then that were largely based on anecdotal reports.",
      "Hazelgrove also makes an unconvincing argument that there were deaths that can be attributed to the panic over the broadcast. He even stretches to speculate that a car accident reported on the night of the broadcast could have been related without any evidence to back that up.",
      "There' no doubt that Welles' drama had a major impact on pop culture, and \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d will have an enduring legacy. Hazelgrove's book misses an opportunity to fully revisit the reports of the panic it caused.",

      "A lawsuit by a former dancer for Shen Yun Performing Arts claims that the nonprofit dance company has subjected some children who perform for it to harsh conditions",
      "WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- A former dancer for Shen Yun Performing Arts sued the nonprofit dance company on Monday, saying it has subjected some children who perform for it to harsh conditions, including long hours for little pay.",
      "The lawsuit brought by Chang Chun-Ko in White Plains federal court sought unspecified damages on behalf of Chang and other alleged victims of Shen Yun, which is based in Dragon Springs in Cuddebackville, New York, along with other entities named as defendants.",
      "It said the group has adopted some of the most abusive practices of the Chinese Communist Party, including subjecting children to public humiliation as discipline, even as it faces persecution by the CCP.",
      "The lawsuit said Shen Yun has made hundreds of millions of dollars by exploiting young dancers it recruits from abroad, forcing them to work grueling hours and scaring them into thinking they'd face harm if they quit.",
      "Shen Yun did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Its website said 85% of its performers were adults. It called touring with Shen Yun a \u201cchance of a lifetime\u201d for aspiring young artists, enabling them to receive $50,000 worth of scholarships to attend schools registered with the New York State Department of Education or accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.",
      "According to the website, Shen Yun, along with Fei Tian Academy of the Arts and Fei Tian College \u2014 which were also named as defendants \u2014 were founded by followers of the Falun Gong faith.",
      "The lawsuit said Chang joined the Fei Tian Academy of the Arts on a full scholarship after her father died when she was 11 because she believed she could help her family by dancing for Shen Yun.",
      "It said she began performing with Shen Yen in December 2009 and received no pay for the first year despite working up to 18 hours a day preparing for shows, including seven at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan.",
      "After the first year, she was paid $500 a month until she \u201cgraduated\u201d from Fei Tian College in 2019, when her salary was raised to $1,000 a month, according to the lawsuit.",
      "She trained from May through November before touring from December to May as a dancer at over 100 shows in the United States and internationally, all while being disallowed from seeing her mother except during a two-week holiday once a year, it said.",
      "The lawsuit said she contracted measles when she was 14 but was not permitted to see a doctor. Instead, the lawsuit said, she was told to meditate to feel better and was required to work while she recovered.",
      "Chang was terminated from Shen Yun in 2020 when she was 24 years old and was returned to Taiwan, where she was diagnosed with clinical depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the lawsuit."

    "summary": "Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel recalls Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s &ldquo;power games&rdquo; over the years, remembers contrasting meetings with Barack Obama and Donald Trump and says she asked herself whether she could have done more to prevent Brexit",
    "story": [
      "Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel recalls Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cpower games\u201d over the years, remembers contrasting meetings with Barack Obama and Donald Trump and says she asked herself whether she could have done more to prevent Brexit",
      "BERLIN -- Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel recalls Vladimir Putin's \u201cpower games\u201d over the years, remembers contrasting meetings with Barack Obama and Donald Trump and says she asked herself whether she could have done more to prevent Brexit, in her memoirs published Tuesday.",
      "Merkel, 70, appears to have no significant doubts about the major decisions of her 16 years as German leader, whose major challenges included the global financial crisis, Europe\u2019s debt crisis, the 2015-16 influx of refugees and the COVID-19 pandemic. True to form, her book \u2014 titled \u201cFreedom\u201d \u2014 offers a matter-of-fact account of her early life in communist East Germany and her later career in politics, laced with moments of dry wit.",
      "Merkel served alongside four U.S. presidents, four French presidents and five British prime ministers. But it is perhaps her dealings with Russian President Putin that have drawn the most scrutiny since she left office in late 2021.",
      "Merkel recalls being kept waiting by Putin at the Group of Eight summit she hosted in 2007 \u2014 \u201cif there's one thing I can't stand, it's unpunctuality.\u201d And she recounts a visit to the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi that year in which Putin's labrador appeared during a photo opportunity, although Putin knew she was afraid of dogs.",
      "Putin appeared to enjoy the situation, she writes, and she didn't bring it up \u2014 keeping as she often did to the motto \u201cnever explain, never complain.\u201d",
      "The previous year, she recounts Putin pointing to wooden houses in Siberia and telling her poor people lived there who \u201ccould be easily seduced,\u201d and that similar groups had been encouraged by money from the U.S. government to take part in Ukraine's \u201cOrange Revolution\u201d of 2004 against attempted election fraud. Putin, she says, added: \u201cI will never allow something like that in Russia.\u201d",
      "Merkel says she was irritated by Putin's \u201cself-righteousness\u201d in a 2007 speech in Munich in which he turned away from earlier attempts to develop closer ties with the U.S. She said that appearance showed Putin as she knew him, \u201cas someone who was always on guard against being treated badly and ready to give out at any time, including power games with a dog and making other people wait for him.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne could find this all childish and reprehensible, one could shake one's head over it \u2014 but that didn't make Russia disappear from the map,\u201d she writes.",
      "As she has before, Merkel defends a much-criticized 2015 peace deal for eastern Ukraine that she helped broker and her government's decisions to buy large quantities of natural gas from Russia. And she argues it was right to keep up diplomatic and trade ties with Moscow until she left power,",
      "Merkel concluded after first meeting then-Sen. Obama in 2008 that they could work well together. More than eight years later, during his last visit as president in Nov. 2016, she was one of the people with whom she discussed whether to seek a fourth term.",
      "Obama, she says, asked questions but held back with an opinion, and that in itself was helpful. He \u201csaid that Europe could still use me very well, but I should ultimately follow my feelings,\u201d she writes.",
      "There was no such warmth with Trump, who had criticized Merkel and Germany in his 2016 campaign. Merkel says she had to seek an \u201cadequate relationship ... without reacting to all the provocations.\u201d",
      "In March 2017, there was an awkward moment when Merkel first visited the Trump White House. Photographers shouted \u201chandshake!\u201d and Merkel quietly asked Trump: \u201cDo you want to have a handshake?\u201d There was no response from Trump, who looked ahead with his hands clasped.",
      "Merkel faults her own reaction. \u201cHe wanted to create a topic of discussion with his behavior, while I had acted as if I were dealing with an interlocutor behaving normally,\u201d she writes. She adds that Putin apparently \u201cfascinated\u201d Trump and, in the following years, she had the impression that \u201cpoliticians with autocratic and dictatorial traits\u201d beguiled him.",
      "Merkel says she tried to help then-Prime Minister David Cameron in the European Union as he faced pressure from British Euroskeptics, but there were limits to what she could do. And, pointing to Cameron's efforts over the years to assuage opponents of the EU, she says the road to Brexit is a textbook example of what can arise from a miscalculation.",
      "After Britons voted to leave the EU in 2016, an outcome she calls a \u201chumiliation\u201d for its other members, she says the question of whether she should have made more concessions to the U.K. \u201ctortured me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI came to the conclusion that, in view of the political developments inside the country at the time, there would have been no acceptable possibility for me to prevent Britain's way out of the European Union from outside,\u201d Merkel says.",
      "Merkel was the first German chancellor to leave power at a time of her choosing. She announced in 2018 that she wouldn't seek a fifth term, and says she \u201clet go at the right point.\u201d",
      "She points to three 2019 incidents in which her body shook during public engagements as proof. Merkel says she had herself checked thoroughly and there were no neurological or other findings. An osteopath told her that her body was letting off the tension it had accumulated over years, she adds.",
      "\u201cFreedom\u201d runs to more than 700 pages in its original German edition, published by Kiepenheuer & Witsch. The English edition is being released simultaneously by St. Martin's Press."

    "summary": "Best-selling author Barbara Taylor Bradford has died",

      "Best-selling author Barbara Taylor Bradford has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Barbara Taylor Bradford, a British journalist who became a publishing sensation in her 40s with the saga \"A Woman of Substance\" and wrote more than a dozen other novels that sold tens of millions of copies, has died. She was 91.",
      "Bradford died Sunday at her home in New York City, a spokesperson said Monday.",
      "Starting with \"A Woman of Substance,\" published in 1979, Bradford averaged nearly a book a year as one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers, her net worth estimated at more than $200 million and her fame so high that her image appeared on a postage stamp in 1999. In 2007, Queen Elizabeth II awarded her an OBE (The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire).",
      "Her books were published in 40 languages and sold more than 90 million copies around the world.",
      "With titles like \u201cBreaking the Rules'' and \u201dAct of Will,'' she specialized in stories of women fighting for love and power in a man's world. Her favorite among her books was \"The Women In His Life,\" inspired by her husband's escape from the Nazis",
      "Bradford was married for 56 years to German-born film producer Robert Bradford, who died in 2019.",
      "A native of Leeds, West Yorkshire, she was an only child in a working class family who loved books early. As a girl, she had a story published in a local magazine. By age 16, she left school against her parents' wishes to become a reporter for the Yorkshire Evening Post. Over the next 30 years, she would work as fashion editor of Woman's Own Magazine, cover a variety of beats for the London Evening News and, in the United States, write a syndicated column about interior design.",
      "Although she wrote children's stories and advice books, novels were her dream. \"A Woman of Substance\" was a multi-generational chronicle of the travails and triumphs of retail baron Emma Harte, who would be featured in several other Bradford novels. The book has sold more than 30 million copies and was the basis of a 1984 television miniseries starring Jenny Seagrove as a young Emma and Deborah Kerr as Emma late in life.",
      "\u201cAnd if you want to meet the real Emma, meet me,\u201d Bradford told the Telegraph of London in 2009. \"Emma had to be tough and ruthless at times: but then so am I. I have to be, as a businesswoman. And I'm a bloody good businesswoman.\"",
      "Bradford and Emma Harte were linked by more than money: both had family secrets. As a young woman, Emma became pregnant by a man who refused to marry her and gave birth to a daughter. Years later, Bradford learned through her biographer that her own mother had been born out of wedlock. It is now believed that Bradford\u2019s maternal grandfather was Frederick Oliver Robinson, the second Marquess of Ripon and owner of the Studley Royal estate in Yorkshire, which is now a World Heritage Site.",
      "Seagrove, who became friends with Bradford after starring in the miniseries, described her as a \u201cpowerhouse of glamour and warmth\u201d and a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who stayed true to her roots.",
      "\u201cSuccess never diluted her warmth and humor or her ability to relate to everyone she met, whether a cleaner or a princess,\u201d Seagrove said. \"She never, ever forgot that she was just a girl from Yorkshire that worked hard and made good. RIP dear friend.\u201d",
      "Bradford had a strict writing routine: at work behind her IBM Lexmark typewriter by 6 a.m., break around 1 p.m., then back to writing until 6 p.m., at the latest. According to an authorized 2006 biography, Piers Dudgeon's \"The Woman of Substance,\" Bradford more than adapted to her midlife fortune, living in a 5,300 square foot apartment overlooking Manhattan's East River, collecting Impressionist art and enjoying refills of pink champagne poured by her Moroccan butler. When the Bradfords put their apartment up for sale in 2010, the asking price was just under $19 million. (They sold it to Uma Thurman in 2013 for $10 million).",
      "Over the years, she met many other celebrities. Bradford befriended Sean Connery before he appeared in his first James Bond movie and remembered advising him, thankfully in vain, that he should lose his Scottish accent if he wanted to succeed.",
      "Around the same time, she met a fellow journalist at the Yorkshire Evening Post. He was \u201clanky and disheveled with acne,\u201d and kept trying to talk to her even after she turned him down for a date at the movies.",
      "He was Peter O'Toole.",
      "\"Years later, (Evening Post editor) Keith Waterhouse and I were at an event where the producer Sam Spiegel introduced the star of his new movie,\" she told The Guardian in 2021. \u201cOut walked the most beautiful man I\u2019d ever seen, dressed as Lawrence of Arabia. Keith said: \u2018Don\u2019t you wish you\u2019d gone to the pictures with him now?\u2019 I never got over Peter\u2019s transformation.\u201d"

      "Police in the town of Shrewsbury are investigating how a tombstone that marked the fictional grave of Ebenezer Scrooge was destroyed. The movie prop used in the 1984 adaption of \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d was kept in place and became a tourist attraction.",
      "Town Clerk Helen Ball said the town is discussing what should be done to fix or replace the stone that is \u201chugely popular\u201d with residents and visitors. This time of year, organized tours of locations used in the movie visit the grounds of St. Chad\u2019s Church to see the marker.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not much to see other than broken bits of the gravestone,\u201d Ball told The Associated Press. \u201cYou can\u2019t see that it says Ebenezer Scrooge at the moment because it\u2019s so damaged. It\u2019s hugely disrespectful.\u201d",
      "The film, one of dozens of adaptations of the Charles Dickens' classic, starred George C. Scott as the cold-hearted curmudgeon. After going to sleep on Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by the ghosts of past, present and future and shown the error of his ways to become a kinder, more generous person.",
      "The future ghost shows Scrooge what will become of his life if he doesn't change. He\u2019s eventually led to a cemetery where the ghost brushes snow from a gravestone that reveals his name. Scrooge, distraught by all he's seen, vows to turn his life around.",
      "West Mercia Police said the stone was vandalized sometime between Thursday and Sunday. Photos showed it broken into several pieces.",
      "If the vandal is caught, Ball said she wouldn\u2019t mind seeing poetic justice served.",
      "\u201cIf the ghosts of past, present and future would like to visit (the vandals) in the middle of the night and drop them and break them in pieces, I think that would be a perfect punishment,\u201d she said."

      "The reaction of those who defended \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski for meeting with President-elect Trump sounds almost quaint in the days of opinionated journalism",
      "One of the striking things about how furiously many people reacted to the news last week that MSNBC \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski met with President-Elect Donald Trump was how quaint their defenders sounded.",
      "\u201cIt is insane for critics to NOT think all of us in the media need to know more so we can share/report more,\u201d Jim VandeHei, co-founder of Axios and Politico, said on social media.",
      "It would be journalistic malpractice for the hosts of a morning television news program not to take a meeting with a president-elect, right? But \u201cMorning Joe\u201d isn't traditional journalism, and last week's incident is a telling illustration of the broader trend of impartial fact-finding being crowded out in the marketplace by opinionated news and the expectations that creates.",
      "Scarborough, a former congressman, and his wife, veteran newswoman Brzezinski, didn't just talk about the presidential campaign from their four-hour weekday perch. They tirelessly and emotionally advocated for Democrat Kamala Harris, likening Trump to a fascist-in-waiting.",
      "\u201cThey have portrayed themselves as bastions of integrity standing up to a would-be dictator,\u201d says Frank Sesno, a former CNN Washington bureau chief now professor at George Washington University's school of media and public affairs. \u201cWhat the followers see is the daily procession of people on the show constantly talking about the evils of Donald Trump and then Joe and Mika show up and have high tea with the guy.\u201d",
      "The social media blowback was instant and intense. \u201cYou do not need to talk to Hitler to cover him effectively,\u201d was one of the nicer messages.",
      "More telling is the people who have responded with action.",
      "\u201cMorning Joe\u201d had 770,000 viewers last Monday, its audience \u2014 like many shows on MSNBC \u2014 down from its yearly average of 1.09 million because some of the network's liberal-leaning viewers have tuned away after what they regard as depressing election results. That's the day Scarborough and Brzezinski announced they had met with Trump the previous Friday.",
      "By Tuesday, the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d audience had slipped to 680,000, according to the Nielsen company, and Wednesday's viewership was 647,000. Thursday rebounded to 707,000. It's only three days of data, but those are the kind of statistics about which television executives brood.",
      "\u201cThe audience for the polarized news-industrial complex has become unforgiving,\u201d says Kate O'Brian, outgoing head of news of the E.W. Scripps Co.",
      "The Washington Post learned this last month when it lost a reported 250,000 subscribers \u2014 presumably the bulk of them non-Trump supporters \u2014 after announcing it would not endorse a candidate for president. A draft of an editorial endorsing Harris had already been in the works.",
      "Mixing news and opinion isn't new; many U.S. newspapers in the 1800s were unabashedly partisan. But for most of the past century, there was a vigorous effort to separate the two. Broadcast television, licensed to serve the public interest, built up fact-based news divisions. What began to change things was the success of Fox News in building a conservative audience that believed it was underserved and undervalued.",
      "Now there's a vigorous industry catering to people who want to see their points of view reflected \u2014 and are less interested in reporting or any content that contradicts them.",
      "The most notable trend in 2024 campaign coverage was the diminishing influence of so-called legacy news brands in favor of outlets like podcasts that offered publicity-hungry politicians a friendly, if not supportive, home. Trump, for example, visited several podcasters, including the influential Joe Rogan, who awarded Trump with an endorsement.",
      "\u201cI won't even call it journalism,\u201d Sesno says. \u201cIt's storytelling.\u201d",
      "The past decade's journey of Megyn Kelly is one illustration of how opinion can pay off in today's climate. Once one of the more aggressive reporters at Fox News, she angered Trump in a 2015 debate with a pointed question about his treatment of women. She moved to the legacy outlet NBC News, but that didn't work for her. She has since started a flourishing podcast with conservative, and Trump-friendly, opinion.",
      "Among cable TV-based news brands, CNN has tried hardest to present an image of impartiality, even if many conservatives disagree. So the collapse in its ratings has been noteworthy: the network's audience of 4.7 million people for its election night coverage was essentially half the 9.1 million people it had for the same night in 2020.",
      "O'Brian is leaving Scripps at the end of the year because it is ending its 24-hour television news network after finding impartiality was a tough business. Scripps is continuing a streaming news product.",
      "That's the environment Scarborough and Brzezinski work in on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are very talented show hosts,\u201d Sesno says. \u201cBut they are not out on the front lines doing journalism, seeking truth in the way that a professional journalist does.\u201d",
      "Hours after the hosts' announcement that they had met with Trump, an MSNBC colleague, legal contributor and correspondent Katie Phang, said on X that \u201cnormalizing Trump is a bad idea.\u201d Scarborough had made a point of saying that was not what he was attempting to do.",
      "\u201cIt's not up to you or your corrupt industry to \u2018normalize\u2019 or not \u2018normalize' any politician who wins an election fair & square,\u201d Christina Pushaw, the pugnacious aide to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, replied to Phang. \u201cAmericans had their say; Trump will be your president come January whether you \u2018normalize\u2019 it or not. I would suggests journos should accept reality.\u201d",
      "Quaintness alert: Sesno is among those who believe the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts did the right thing.",
      "Whatever the motivations \u2014 and there are some who believe that worries that a Trump administration could make life difficult very difficult for them was on the hosts' minds \u2014 opening a line of communication to ensure that a show based on politics is not completely cut off from the thinking of a presidential administration makes business sense, he says. A little humility doesn't hurt.",
      "Even if her own job has proven that it's not a great business now, Scripps' O'Brian has seen enough focus groups of people who yearn for a more traditional journalism-based approach to believe in its importance.",
      "\u201cI think that there is still a need for nonpartisan news,\" says the former longtime ABC News producer, \u201cand maybe what brings it back to where it used to be will be an exhaustion from the hyper-polarized climate that we currently live in.\u201d",

      "Drake has begun legal action against Universal Music Group, alleging the company conspired to falsely pump up the popularity of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "Drake alleged in a court filing Monday that Universal Music Group falsely pumped up the popularity on Spotify and other streaming services of Kendrick Lamar's \u201cNot Like Us,\" a song that viciously attacked Drake amid a bitter feud between the two hip-hop superstars.",
      "The petition in a New York court by the rapper's company Frozen Moments LLC demands the preservation and divulgence of information that might be evidence in a potential lawsuit against UMG, which is the distributor for the record labels of both Drake and Lamar.",
      "In allegations that UMG calls \u201coffensive and untrue,\u201d the filing says the record company \u201claunched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves with a song, \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019 in order to make that song go viral, including by using \u2018bots\u2019 and pay-to-play agreements.\u201d It said the company and Spotify \u201chave a long-standing, symbiotic business relationship\u201d and alleges that UMG offered special licensing rates to Spotify for the song.",
      "The petition also says UMG has fired employees seen as loyal to Drake \"in an apparent effort to conceal its schemes.\"",
      "Universal Music Group said in a statement in response that the \"suggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot Like Us,\u201d the wildly popular Lamar single released in May as part of a flurry of dueling tracks by the two artists, includes the lyrics, \u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young, You better not ever go to cell block one.\u201d It has gotten more than 900 million plays, according to figures listed on Spotify.",
      "Spotify representatives declined immediate comment, but in a statement on a previous case, the company said it \u201cinvests heavily in automated and manual reviews to prevent, detect, and mitigate the impact of artificial streaming on our platform,\u201d and in broader public statements has said it has gone to great lengths to mitigate the effects of bad actors on streaming numbers and royalties.",
      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner who is set to headline the next Super Bowl halftime, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre's biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply earlier this year. The move to court, while not yet a lawsuit, still represents a major escalation of the feud and involves some of the biggest business partners of both men."

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas has delayed a hearing in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars and turning it into a parody",
      "A bankruptcy judge on Monday delayed a hearing in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars, keeping the auction sale up in the air for at least another few weeks.",
      "Jones alleges fraud and collusion marred the bankruptcy auction that resulted in The Onion being named the winning bidder over a company affiliated with him. A trustee overseeing the auction denies the allegations and accuses Jones of launching a smear campaign because he didn't like the outcome.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez had been scheduled to hear an emergency motion to disqualify The Onion's bid on Monday, but put it off until either Dec. 9 or Dec. 17. That's also when the judge will hear arguments on the trustee's request to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion. Lopez said it made sense to have one hearing on both requests.",
      "\u201cI want a fair and transparent process and let\u2019s just see where the process goes,\" Lopez said.",
      "Lopez could ultimately allow The Onion to move forward with its purchase, order a new auction or name the other bidder as the winner. At stake is whether Jones gets to stay at Infowars\u2019 studio in Austin, Texas, under a new owner friendly to him, or whether he gets kicked out by The Onion.",
      "The other bidder, First United American Companies, runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements.",
      "Jones continues to broadcast his show from the Infowars studio, but he has set up a new location, websites and social media accounts as a precaution. The trustee shut down the Austin studio and Infowars' websites for about 24 hours last week after The Onion was announced as the winning bidder, but allowed them to resume the next day, drawing more complaints from Jones.",
      "Jones declared bankruptcy and liquidated his assets after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion to relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. He was ordered to pay damages for defamation and emotional distress in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas after he repeatedly said the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators was a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Proceeds from the liquidation are to go to Jones\u2019 creditors, including the Sandy Hook families who sued him.",
      "Last year, Lopez ruled that $1.1 billion of the Sandy Hook judgments could not be discharged in the bankruptcy. On Monday, he denied a request from Sandy Hook families to make the full $1.5 billion not dischargeable, meaning the debt cannot be wiped clean.",
      "Also Monday, lawyers for the social media platform X objected to any sale of the accounts of both Jones and Infowars, saying X is the owner of the accounts and it has not given consent for them to be sold or transferred. Jones' personal X account, with 3.3 million followers, was not part of the auction, but Lopez will be deciding if it should be included in the liquidation.",
      "Jones has praised X owner Elon Musk on his show and suggested that Musk should buy Infowars. Musk has not responded publicly to that suggestion and was not among the bidders.",
      "Jones was permanently banned from Twitter in 2018 for abusive behavior, but Musk restored Jones\u2019 account on the platform he has since renamed X in December last year.",
      "Jones alleges The Onion\u2019s bid was the result of fraud and collusion involving many of the Sandy Hook families, the humor site and the court-appointed trustee.",
      "First United American Companies submitted a $3.5 million sealed bid, while The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash. But The Onion's bid also included a pledge by Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, said that made The Onion's proposal better for creditors and he named it the winning bid.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies claimed that the bid violated Lopez\u2019s rules for the auction by including multiple entities and lacking a valid dollar amount. Jones also alleged Murray improperly canceled an expected round of live bidding and only selected from among the two sealed bids that were submitted.",
      "Jones called the auction \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d on his show, which airs on the Infowars website, radio stations and Jones' X account. He filed a counter lawsuit last week against Murray, The Onion's parent company and the Sandy Hook families in the bankruptcy court.",
      "In a court filing on Sunday, Murray called the allegations a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to delay the sale of Infowars to The Onion and accused Jones, his lawyers and attorneys for First United American Companies of a \u201cvicious smear campaign lobbing patently false accusations.\u201d He also alleged Jones collaborated with First United American Companies to try to buy Infowars.",
      "Lopez\u2019s September order on the auction procedures made a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "The assets of Infowars' parent company, Free Speech Systems, that were up for sale included the Austin studio, Infowars' video archive, video production equipment, product trademarks, and Infowars' websites and social media accounts. Another auction of remaining assets is set for Dec. 10.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights, but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate, guns and other belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Documents filed in court this year say Jones had about $9 million in personal assets, while Free Speech Systems had about $6 million in cash and more than $1 million worth of inventory."

      "\u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d have debuted in theaters with a combined $270 million in ticket sales",
      "NEW YORK -- With a combined $270 million in worldwide ticket sales, \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d breathed fresh life into a box office that has struggled lately, leading to one of the busiest moviegoing weekends of the year.",
      "Jon M. Chu\u2019s lavish big-budget musical \u201cWicked,\u201d starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, debuted with $114 million domestically and $164.2 million globally for Universal Pictures, according to studio estimates Sunday. That made it the third-biggest opening weekend of the year, behind only \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d It\u2019s also a record for a Broadway musical adaptation.",
      "Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II,\u201d a sequel to his 2000 best picture-winning original, launched with $55.5 million in ticket sales. With a price tag of around $250 million to produce it, \u201cGladiator II\u201d was a big bet by Paramount Pictures to return to the Colosseum with a largely new cast, led by Denzel Washington and Paul Mescal. While it opened with a touch less than the $60 million predicted in domestic ticket sales, \u201cGladiator II\u201d has performed well overseas. It added $50.5 million internationally.",
      "The collision of the two movies led to some echoes of the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d effect of last year, when \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d launched simultaneously. The nickname this time, \u201cGlicked,\u201d wasn\u2019t quite as catchy and the cultural imprint also was notably less. Few people sought out a double feature this time. The domestic grosses in 2023 \u2014 $162 million for \u201cBarbie\u201d and $82 million for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2014 also were higher.",
      "For Universal, which distributed \u201cOppenheimer\" last year, the weekend was more a triumph of \u201cWicked\" than it was of \u201cGlicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe saw an opportunity to dominate a weekend and get a very large running start into the Thanksgiving holiday,\" said Jim Orr, distribution chief for Universal. \"We're very confident that it will play ridiculously well through the Christmas corridor and into the new year.\u201d",
      "But the counter-programming effect was still potent for \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II,\u201d which likewise split broadly along gender lines. And it was again the female-leaning release \u2014 \u201cWicked,\u201d like \u201cBarbie\u201d before it \u2014 that easily won the weekend. About 72% of ticket buyers for \u201cWicked\u201d were female, while 61% of those seeing \u201cGladiator II\u201d were male.",
      "\u201cStanding on their own, each of these movies may have done pretty much what they did, but it\u2019s hard to know,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cRaising awareness can indeed lead to an increase in box office. Let\u2019s put it this way: They didn\u2019t hurt each other at all.\u201d",
      "While \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d benefitted enormously from meme-spread word-of-mouth, both \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d leaned on all-out marketing blitzes.",
      "The \u201cGladiator II\u201d campaign featured everything from a much-debated Airbnb cross-promotion with the actual Colosseum in Rome to simultaneously running a one-minute trailer on more than 4,000 TV networks, radio station and digital platforms.",
      "The \u201cWicked\u201d onslaught went even further, with pink and green themed \u201cWickedly Delicious\u201d Starbucks drinks, Stanley mugs and Mattel dolls (some of which led to an awkward recall ). Its stars made appearances at the Met Gala and the Olympics.",
      "\u201cWe had roughly 400 global brand partners on \u2018Wicked,\u2019 so the campaign was inescapable, said Orr. \u201cAnd our cast, led by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, worked so hard on this. They were everywhere. They did everything we asked them to do.\u201d",
      "Going into the weekend, box office was down about 11% from last year and some 25% from pre-pandemic times. That meant this week's two headline films led a much-needed resurgence for theaters. With \u201cMoana 2\u201d releasing Wednesday, Hollywood might be looking at historic sales over the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "\u201cThis weekend\u2019s two strong openers are invigorating a box office that fell apart after a good summer,\u201d said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment.",
      "Though \u201cWicked\u201d will face some direct competition from \u201cMoana 2,\u201d it would seem better set up for a long and lucrative run in theaters than \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Though some have dinged \u201cWicked\u201d for running long, at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the film has had mostly stellar reviews. Audiences gave it an \u201cA\u201d on CinemaScore. The reception for \u201cWicked\u201d has been strong enough that Oscar prognosticators expect it to be a contender for best picture at the Academy Awards, among other categories.",
      "Producers, perhaps sensing a hit, also took the step of splitting \u201cWicked\u201d in two. Part two, already filmed, is due out next November. Each \u201cWicked\u201d installation cost around $150 million to make.",
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d has also enjoyed good reviews, particularly for Washington's charismatic performance. Audience scores, though, were weaker, with ticket buyers giving it a \u201cB\u201d on CinemaScore. The film will make up for some of that, however, with robust international sales. It launched in many overseas markets a week ago, and has already accrued $165.5 million internationally.",
      "Coming in a distant third place for the weekend was \u201cRed One,\u201d the Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans holiday movie turned action film.

      "With his surprise-dropped \u201cGNX,\u201d Kendrick Lamar roars from zero to 60 faster than a turbocharged \u201987 Buick",
      "With his surprise-dropped \u201cGNX,\u201d Kendrick Lamar roars from zero to 60 faster than a turbocharged \u201987 Buick, faster than you can shout \u201cMustaaaaard.\u201d And waaaaay faster than you can decode the dense biblical centerpiece \u201cReincarnated.\u201d",
      "Keeping the same energy of his landmark Pop Out concert five months ago, Lamar surrounds himself with up-and-coming Los Angeles artists \u2014 from AzChike to Peysoh \u2014 and raps over thumping New West Coast soundscapes shaped by his longtime producer Sounwave, along with Jack Antonoff and a garageful of other beat mechanics. He\u2019s once again \u201cpossessed by a spirit,\u201d sprinkling 2Pac, Biggie and Nas references throughout and maintaining a me-against-the-world antipathy that includes but extends well beyond a certain Canadian: \u201cI just strangled me a GOAT\u201d and \u201cnow it\u2019s plural.\u201d",
      "Lil Wayne, Snoop Dogg, Andrew Schulz, and even Fox\u2019s Super Bowl broadcast can\u2019t escape K-Dot\u2019s chaotic crosshairs. Here\u2019s hoping the chorus of \u201ctv off\u201d \u2014 an urgent call to \u201cturn this TV off\u201d repeated eight times \u2014 confuses the masses during his New Orleans halftime show in February.",
      "This is Lamar leaning into the same creativity-juicing pride, self-righteous anger and supreme confidence that fueled the Grammy-nominated \u201cNot Like Us\u201d and won his Drake feud: \u201cI kill \u2018em all before I let \u2018em kill my joy.\u201d And yet, as with his first-ever hit \u201cSwimming Pools (Drank),\u201d even the most club-ready braggadocio songs \u2014 and there are plenty, including the massive \u201csquabble up\u201d and synth-stabbed Mustard production \u201chey now\u201d \u2014 are slapped with a caution sticker. Introspection is baked into Lamar\u2019s art. In \u201cman at the garden,\u201d he\u2019s surveying his kingdom and glory and declares that while \u201cI deserve it all,\u201d \u201cdangerously / nothing changed with me / still got pain in me.\u201d",
      "At age 37, Lamar remains in peak form (that breath control!) and stands alone in the rap world as a star who bridges generations without chasing trends. He generates his own gravity in the hip-hop universe. Pulling samples from the early \u201980s \u2014 Debbie Deb, Luther Vandross, Whodini \u2014 he\u2019s able to switch cadences and lyrical perspectives mid-song without ever losing the listener.",
      "Album closer \u201cgloria,\u201d one of two tracks featuring former TDE labelmate SZA, is a glorious celebration of the pain and power of writing. In the vein of Common\u2019s \u201cI Used to Love H.E.R.\u201d or Nas\u2019 \u201cI Gave You Power,\u201d Lamar\u2019s love story details a \u201ccomplicated relationship\u201d that listeners at first may think is about his longtime partner Whitney Alford, but turns out to be dedicated to his pen.",
      "While carefully structured, \u201cGNX\u201d feels a bit more scattershot than Lamar\u2019s traditionally concept-heavy studio albums. And there are hints that this collection of 12 songs is more of a \u201cPart 1\u201d or mixtape-type prelude to something more formal: The brief music video announcing the album features a snippet of a song that doesn\u2019t even appear on \u201cGNX.\u201d",
      "Whatever comes next, the Pulitzer Prize winner has written another thrilling chapter in what remains the most fascinating longform story in hip-hop: an ambitious and searingly talented poet from Compton working through his \u2014 and the world\u2019s \u2014 contradictions on the biggest stage, forever discomforted by his crown. ___",

      "Woolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
      "In 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV\u2019s \u201cLove Connection,\u201d for which he coined the phrase, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in two minutes and two seconds,\u201d a two-fingered signature dubbed the \u201c2 and 2.\u201d In 1984, he hosted TV\u2019s \u201cScrabble,\u201d simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.",
      "\u201cLove Connection,\u201d which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.",
      "A couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest\u2019s choice, \u201cLove Connection\u201d would offer to pay for a second date.",
      "Woolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. \"She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, \u2018I remember wagon trains.\u2019 The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.\u201d",

      "Woolery became the subject of the Game Show Network\u2019s first attempt at a reality show, \u201cChuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,\u201d which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.",
      "Woolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d debuted Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.",
      "\u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d started life as \u201cShopper\u2019s Bazaar,\u201d incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on \u201cThe Merv Griffin Show\u201d singing \u201cDelta Dawn,\u201d Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.",
      "\u201cI had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,\u201d Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. \u201cAfter the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, \u2018Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn\u2019t care what you have to say \u2014 that\u2019s the guy I want to be.\u2019\u201d",
      "NBC initially passed, but they retooled it as \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d and got the green light.

      "After The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single \u201cI\u2019ve Been Wrong\u201d in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, \u201cForgive My Heart\u201d and \u201cLove Me, Love Me.\u201d",
      "Woolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette.

      "After his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn\u2019t revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.",
      "He teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast \u201cBlunt Force Truth\u201d and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don\u2019t need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.",
      "\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,\u201d he said.",
      "Woolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as \u201cImpeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.\u201d",
      "During the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump\u2019s chances for reelection to the presidency.",
      "\u201cThe most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it\u2019s all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I\u2019m sick of it,\u201d Woolery wrote in July 2020.",
      "Trump retweeted that post to his 83 million followers. By the end of the month, nearly 4.5 million Americans had been infected with COVID-19 and more than 150,000 had died.",
      "Just days later, Woolery changed his stance, announcing his son had contracted COVID-19. \u201cTo further clarify and add perspective, COVID-19 is real and it is here. My son tested positive for the virus, and I feel for of those suffering and especially for those who have lost loved ones,\u201d Woolery posted before his account was deleted.",
      "Woolery later explained on his podcast that he never called COVID-19 \u201ca hoax\u201d or said \u201cit\u2019s not real,\u201d just that \u201cwe\u2019ve been lied to.\u201d Woolery also said it was \u201can honor to have your president retweet what your thoughts are and think it\u2019s important enough to do that.\u201d",
      "In addition to his wife, Woolery is survived by his sons Michael and Sean and his daughter Melissa, Young said.",

      "JACKSON, Miss. -- JACKSON, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Medical marijuana businesses in Mississippi don't have the right to advertise on billboards or other places because marijuana itself remains illegal under federal law, an appeals court says.",
      "The owner of a medical marijuana dispensary argued that the First Amendment protects the right to advertise because Mississippi law permits the sale of cannabis products to people with debilitating medical conditions. The state enacted its law in 2022.",
      "A three-judge panel of 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected the arguments about advertising. They cited the federal Controlled Substances Act, which since 1970 has prohibited the manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of marijuana.",
      "The federal law applies in all states, and Mississippi \u201cfaces no constitutional obstacle to restricting commercial speech relating to unlawful transactions,\u201d the judges wrote.",
      "The Mississippi attorney general's office praised the court decision for upholding \"Mississippi\u2019s reasonable restrictions on advertising for medical marijuana dispensaries by print, broadcast, and other mass communications,\u201d said the office spokesperson, MaryAsa Lee.",
      "Clarence Cocroft II operates Tru Source Medical Cannabis in the northern Mississippi city of Olive Branch. He sued the state in 2023 to challenge its ban on medical marijuana advertising on billboards or in print, broadcast or social media or via mass email or text messaging.",
      "\u201cUpholding this ban makes it incredibly difficult for me to find potential customers and to educate people about Mississippi\u2019s medical marijuana program,\u201d Cocroft said in a statement Monday. \u201cI remain committed to continuing this fight so my business can be treated the same as any other legal business in Mississippi.\u201d",
      "The state allows medical marijuana businesses to have websites or social media accounts that provide information about their retail dispensing locations and a list of products available. It allows them to be listed in phone books or business directories and to display cannabis in company logos. The businesses can also sponsor not-for-profit charity or advocacy events.",
      "Cocroft is represented by the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian law firm. The firm said Monday that it is considering its next steps in the lawsuit, including possibly asking the entire appeals court to reconsider the case or an appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cMississippi cannot on the one hand create an entire marketplace for the sale of medical marijuana, and on the other hand rely on an unenforced federal law to prohibit buyers and sellers from talking about it,\u201d said Ari Bargil, an Institute for Justice attorney."

      "The Missouri law banned gender-affirming surgeries for children and teenagers under the age of 18, as well as hormones and puberty blockers for minors who had not started those treatments as of August 2023. The law expires in August 2027.",
      "These treatments are accepted by major medical groups as evidence-based care that transgender people should be able to access.",
      "Most adults still are allowed to access gender-affirming health care under the Missouri law, but Medicaid won\u2019t cover it.",

      "Top officials in Arizona have certified the state\u2019s election results",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona top officials certified the state\u2019s election results Monday, including voters' approval of a measure that expands abortion access from 15 weeks to the point of fetal viability.",
      "The victory for reproductive rights groups sets the stage for their next battle: challenging other laws on the books in Arizona they say are too restrictive. The 15-week cutoff, for example, allows exceptions only when the mother's life is at risk.",
      "Absent a court order or legislative action, those laws will remain unchanged, even if they conflict with the voter-approved measure. Opponents of the constitutional amendment are preparing a defense.",
      "For now, providers will have discretion in performing abortions beyond 15 weeks. Legal challenges are expected within days, Attorney General Kris Mayes said at a news conference celebrating expanded access.",
      "\"The position of the state of Arizona will be that we agree that abortion is legal in our state,\" Mayes said.",
      "Arizona was one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in the 2024 general election to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they'll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Abortion has long been an important political issue in the U.S., but it\u2019s become a defining one since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade and cleared the way for states to ban or restrict access. Most Republican-controlled states have done so, and abortion rights groups have been pushing back through ballot measures. Earlier this year, Arizonans faced the possibility of living under a near-total abortion ban.",
      "Chris Love, a spokesperson for Arizona for Abortion Access, said the constitutional amendment is the culmination of two years of hard work.",
      "\"We\u2019re so excited to see that this is finally coming to fruition,\u201d Love said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely day.\u201d",
      "Cathi Herrod, president of the socially conservative Center for Arizona Policy, said the organization is anticipating legal challenges to current laws regulating abortion and is preparing to \u201cintervene where appropriate.\u201d",
      "Among those current laws is one that requires patients to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours before the procedure, with the option to view the image and hear an explanation of what it shows. Another criminalizes abortions sought solely because of a genetic abnormality.",
      "\u201cAll the laws that have currently been on the books are under question and are subject to possible challenges at some point,\u201d said Darrell Hill, policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates in Missouri sued immediately after a ballot measure there passed earlier this month seeking to have bans and other abortion-restricting laws invalidated. The circumstances are different there because that state currently has a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and no clinics are providing it. A hearing is scheduled for Dec. 4.",
      "Earlier in the day, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs contrasted Monday\u2019s statewide canvass of election results with the one four years ago, which she said was held against the backdrop of \u201craging conspiracies, attempts to stop certification across the country,\u201d leading to the Jan. 6 insurrection. She said she was grateful this time was different.",
      "Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said voters across the state cast 3,428,011 ballots in the 2024 election, up 7,446 ballots from 2020.",
      "The turnout of registered voters remained relatively unchanged, at just below 80%. Turnout was 79% for the 2020 election and 78% for the 2024 election. ___ Associated Press writer Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed to this report.

      "NEW YORK -- The outgoing head of the nation\u2019s top public health agency urged the next administration to maintain its focus and funding to keep Americans safe from emerging health threats.",
      "\u201cWe need to continue to do our global work at CDC to make sure we are stopping outbreaks at their source,\u201d Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview Monday with The Associated Press. \u201cWe need to keep that funding up. We need to keep the expertise up. We need to keep the diplomacy up.\u201d",
      "Cohen, 46, will be leaving office in January after about 18 months in the job. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday night said he picked Dave Weldon, a former Congressman from Florida, to be the agency\u2019s next chief.",
      "Cohen said she hasn\u2019t met Weldon and doesn\u2019t know him. She previously voiced concern about Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the anti-vaccine advocate and CDC critic nominated to oversee all federal public health agencies.",
      "The CDC, with a $9.2 billion core budget, is charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats. The staff is heavy with scientists \u2014 60% have master\u2019s degrees or doctorates.",
      "The last eight years have been perhaps the most difficult in the agency's history. The CDC once enjoyed a sterling international reputation for its expertise on infectious diseases and other causes of illness and death. But trust in the agency fell because of missteps during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, political attacks and resistance to infection-prevention measures like wearing masks and getting vaccinated.",
      "The CDC has four political appointees, out of about 13,000 employees. The rest serve no matter who is in the White House, with civil service protections against efforts to fire them for political reasons.",
      "Trump said during the campaign that he wants to convert many federal agency positions into political appointments, meaning those employees could be hired and fired by whoever wins the election.",
      "There\u2019s also a proposal to split the agency in two: one to track disease data, and another focused on public health but with a limited ability to make policy recommendations.",
      "And then there\u2019s a current budget proposal in Congress that would cut the agency\u2019s funding by 22%. It would also eliminate the CDC\u2019s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which works on topics like drownings, drug overdoses, suicides and and shooting deaths.",
      "Cohen said there\u2019s reason to be proud of the agency\u2019s work in recent years. The CDC has built partnerships to improve the availability of testing for different infections and to watch for signs of disease outbreaks by monitoring wastewater. There are emerging threats, as always, but no new, full-fledged public health emergencies, she said.",
      "The day after the Nov. 5 election, Cohen emailed CDC employees to urge them to keep going.",
      "\u201cWhile the world may feel different with changes ahead \u2014 our mission has not changed,\u201d she wrote.",
      "She said she\u2019s not aware of any wave of worried CDC scientists heading for the doors because of the election results.",
      "\u201cThere is a difference between campaigning and governing,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to go into this in a way that we\u2019re passing the baton.\u201d",
      "Cohen said she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019ll do next, other than spend time with her family in Raleigh, North Carolina, where her family maintained its residence while she ran the agency.",
      "Next year, for the first time, the CDC director will be subject to Senate confirmation, which could make for a gap before Trump's pick takes the helm. CDC Deputy Director Dr. Debra Houry has been assigned to help manage the transition.",
      "Aside from administration transition, the CDC has to face several looming threats.",
      "Officials this month confirmed the first U.S. case of a new form of mpox that was first seen in eastern Congo.",
      "There\u2019s also the ongoing stream of bird flu cases, most of them mild illnesses seen in farmworkers who were in direct contact with infected cows or chickens. CDC officials say they believe the risk to the public remains low and that there\u2019s no evidence it\u2019s been spreading between people.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re yet at a turning place. But does that mean it couldn\u2019t change tomorrow? It could,\u201d she said.",

      "There\u2019s no place like home for the holidays",
      "NEW YORK -- There's no place like home for the holidays. And that may not necessarily be a good thing.",
      "In the wake of the very contentious and divisive 2024 presidential election, the upcoming celebration of Thanksgiving and the ramp-up of the winter holiday season could be a boon for some \u2014 a respite from the events of the larger world in the gathering of family and loved ones. Hours and even days spent with people who have played the largest roles in our lives. Another chapter in a lifetime of memories.",
      "That's one scenario.",
      "For others, that same period \u2014 particularly because of the polarizing presidential campaign \u2014 is something to dread. There is the likelihood of disagreements, harsh words, hurt feelings and raised voices looming large.",
      "Those who make a study of people and their relationships to each other in an increasingly complex 21st-century say there are choices that those with potentially fraught personal situations can make \u2014 things to do and things to avoid \u2014 that could help them and their families get through this time with a minimum of open conflict and a chance at getting to the point of the holidays in the first place.",
      "For those who feel strongly about the election's outcome, and know that the people they would be spending the holiday feel just as strongly in the other direction, take the time to honestly assess if you're ready to spend time together in THIS moment, barely a few weeks after Election Day \u2014 and a time when feelings are still running high.",
      "The answer might be that you're not, and it might be better to take a temporary break, says Justin Jones-Fosu, author of \u201cI Respectfully Disagree: How to Have Difficult Conversations in a Divided World.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to assess your own readiness,\u201d he says, \u201cEach person is going be very different in this.\u201d",
      "He emphasizes that it's not about taking a permanent step back. \u201cRight now is that moment that we\u2019re talking about because it\u2019s still so fresh. Christmas may be different.\u201d",
      "Keep focused on why why you decided to go in the first place, Jones-Fosu says. Maybe it\u2019s because there\u2019s a relative there you don\u2019t get to see often, or a loved one is getting up in age, or your kids want to see their cousins. Keeping that reason in mind could help you get through the time.",
      "If you decide getting together is the way to go, but you know politics is still a dicey subject, set a goal of making the holiday a politics-free zone and stick with it, says Karl Pillemer, a professor at Cornell University whose work includes research on family estrangement.",
      "\u201cWill a political conversation change anyone\u2019s mind?\" he says. \u201cIf there is no possibility of changing anyone\u2019s mind, then create a demilitarized zone and don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d",
      "Let\u2019s be honest. Sometimes, despite best efforts and intentions to keep the holiday gathering politics- and drama-free, there\u2019s someone who\u2019s got something to say and is going to say it.",
      "In that case, avoid getting drawn into it, says Tracy Hutchinson, a professor in the graduate clinical mental health counseling program at the College of William & Mary in Virginia.",
      "\u201cNot to take the hook is one of the most important things, and it is challenging,\u201d she says. After all, you don\u2019t have to go to every argument you\u2019re invited to.",
      "If you risk getting caught up in the moment, consider engaging in what Pillemer calls \u201cforward mapping.\u201d This involves thinking medium and long term rather than just about right now \u2014 strategy rather than tactics. Maybe imagine yourself six months from now looking back on the dinner and thinking about the memories you'd want to have.",
      "\u201cThink about how you would like to remember this holiday,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you want to remember it with your brother and sister-in-law storming out and going home because you\u2019ve had a two-hour argument?\u201d",
      "Things getting intense? Defuse the situation. Walk away. And it doesn't have to be in a huff. Sometimes a calm and collected time out is just what you \u2014 and the family \u2014 might need.",
      "Says Hutchinson: \u201cIf they do start to do something like that, you could say, `I\u2019ve got to make this phone call. I\u2019ve got to go to the bathroom. I\u2019m going to take a walk around the block.'\""

      "Food safety experts say safely serving a holiday feast takes planning and know-how",
      "Ready or not, the holidays are here. It's a time when many Americans accustomed to preparing simple meals find themselves responsible for safely serving multi-dish feasts.",
      "It's no easy task. Outbreaks of some types of food poisoning tend to rise in November and December, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Tainted turkey, undercooked stuffing and germ-laced gravy from holiday buffets have all led to past illnesses \u2014 and even deaths \u2014 CDC investigators have found.",
      "It can be tricky for occasional cooks to prepare big meals in a way that avoids the common hazards that can make people sick, said Donald Schaffner, a food science expert at Rutgers University.",
      "\u201cCooking takes longer with big masses of food. Cooling takes longer with big masses of food,\u201d said Schaffner, who co-hosts the food-safety podcast \u201cRisky or Not?\u201d",
      "Together with podcast co-host Benjamin Chapman, a food scientist at North Carolina State University, Schaffner outlined common ways to keep holiday meals both festive and safe.",
      "Nearly 90% of U.S. hosts plan to serve turkey on Thanksgiving this year, according to the turkey producer Butterball.",
      "But raw turkey can harbor illness-causing bacteria such as salmonella, campylobacter and other germs. It must be handled safely to prevent those bugs from contaminating refrigerator surfaces, sinks and kitchen counters.",
      "A frozen bird must be thawed first. There are several accepted methods, including in the refrigerator, in the microwave or in cold running water, Schaffner said.",
      "\u201cAll of these methods pose risks,\u201d he cautioned.",
      "A frozen turkey needs about 24 hours for every 4 to 5 pounds of weight to thaw in a refrigerator, according to the Agriculture Department. If you use a microwave or the cold water method, the bird must be cooked immediately. For details about safe turkey handling, check out the thawing and cooking calculators created by the USDA.",
      "And don\u2019t wash the turkey. It\u2019s a bad idea to rinse it in the sink, even though many cooks still insist on the practice, often out of habit, said Chapman.",
      "\u201cAnything that hits that surface and generates spray is going to basically spread contamination around your kitchen,\u201d he said.",
      "Instead, pat the turkey dry with paper towels and toss them, or use a kitchen towel and disinfect it in the laundry.",
      "Turkey needs to reach a cooked temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit before serving. The best way to tell if it\u2019s cooked is to use a tip-sensitive digital thermometer inserted in the innermost section of the thigh, not touching the bone.",
      "Don\u2019t rely on the plastic pop-up thermometers stuck in some commercial turkeys. Chapman\u2019s past research shows that those buttons can activate well before the bird is actually done.",
      "At the same time, don\u2019t determine doneness by relying on signs such as golden-brown skin, whether the meat is no longer pink or whether the juices run clear.",
      "\u201cNone of those are great indicators of temperature,\u201d Chapman said.",
      "How you handle the rest of the meal \u2014 mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans or yams \u2014 is just as important as the main dish. It\u2019s crucial to avoid the so-called danger zone of temperatures between 40 degrees and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, where bacteria can easily grow.",
      "The key is to keep hot foods piping hot and cold foods cold \u2014 and to refrigerate everything promptly, Schaffner said.",
      "\u201cThe recommendation is that you get those leftovers into the refrigerator within two hours of when they came off of the stove,\u201d he said.",
      "Make sure to refrigerate dense foods like sliced turkey, cooked sweet potatoes or gravy in shallow containers to help them cool down fast. Schaffner\u2019s recent research showed that foods cooled in containers at a depth of no more than 2 inches posed little risk of growing dangerous germs.",

      "Extreme weather is making power outages longer and more frequent across the U.S. People with health conditions who depend on medical devices powered by electricity are particularly vulnerable",
      "HOUSTON -- Kimberly Rubit had one priority in mind as Hurricane Beryl ripped through Houston this summer: her severely disabled daughter.",
      "The 63-year-old worked nonstop to prevent Mary, 42, from overheating without air conditioning, water or lights after Beryl knocked out power to their home for 10 days. At least three dozen other people suffered heat-related deaths during the extended outage.",
      "\u201cIt was miserable,\u201d Rubit said. \u201cI\u2019m sick of it.\u201d",
      "Electric grids have buckled more frequently and outages have become longer across the U.S. as the warming atmosphere carries more water and stirs up more destructive storms, according to an AP analysis of government data. In the Pacific Northwest this week, a \u201c bomb cyclone \u201d caused roughly half a million outages.",
      "People with disabilities and chronic health conditions are particularly at risk when the power goes out, and many live in homes that lack the weatherizing and backup power supplies needed to better handle high temperatures and cold freezes, or can't pay their electricity bills, said Columbia University sociomedical sciences professor Diana Hernandez, who studies energy instability in U.S. homes.",
      "At any given time, 1 in 3 households in the U.S. is \"actively trying to avoid a disconnection or contending with the aftermath of it,\u201d Hernandez said.",
      "In Texas, as another winter approaches, people can't shake fears of another blackout like the one during a cold freeze in 2021 that left millions without power for days and killed more than 200 people. Despite efforts to create more resilience, a winter storm that powerful could still lead to rolling blackouts, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages most of the state's power grid.",
      "Beryl also knocked out power to millions for days, sickening many in the sweltering July heat. Local and state officials showered criticism on CenterPoint Energy, Houston\u2019s power utility, saying it should have communicated more clearly, taken more preventive measures such as tree trimming before the storm hit and repaired downed power lines more quickly. The utility's response remains under investigation by the Texas attorney general.",
      "CenterPoint says it is focused now on improving resiliency, customer communications and community partnerships with the one defining goal: \u201cto build the most resilient coastal grid in the country that can better withstand the extreme weather of the future.\u201d",
      "Texas lawmakers, meanwhile, are debating whether assisted living facilities need more regulation. One suggestion: requiring them to have enough emergency generator fuel to power lifesaving equipment and keep indoor temperatures safe during an extended blackout, as Florida did after a scandal over hurricane-related nursing home deaths.",
      "The legislative panel also reviewed emergency responses this month. Regulated facilities and nursing centers fared better than places such as senior communities that aren't subject to strict oversight, according to city and state officials. This meant hundreds of apartment complexes catering to older adults, as well as private homes, were likely more susceptible to losing power and going without food.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to mark these facilities or get it entered into the computer dispatch systems,\u201d said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. \u201cThere are so many places in our own city that we have no idea until that 911 call comes into that facility,\u201d he said.",
      "Texas energy companies have been required since 2003 to provide advance notice of scheduled outages to medically vulnerable households that submit a form with physician approval. But that law didn't require the utilities to share these lists with state or local emergency management agencies.",
      "Numerous states have similar regulatory requirements and 38 have policies aimed at preventing disconnections during extreme weather, according to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. In Colorado, medically vulnerable residents are protected from disconnection for up to 90 days. In Arkansas, utilities can\u2019t disconnect power to people who are 65 or older if temperatures are forecast to reach above 94 degrees Fahrenheit (34 Celsius).",
      "In Houston, Rubit and her daughter share one of the roughly 3,000 households where unreliable power can quickly spiral into a life-and-death issue because at least one person requires a medical device powered by electricity, according to public filings from CenterPoint. The utility offers such households payment plans to keep the electricity on when they fall behind on their bills.",
      "The utility's efforts bring little solace to community members at a Houston living center for seniors, Commons of Grace, where outages have become a haunting facet of life for more than 100 residents, said Belinda Taylor, who runs a nonprofit partnered with the managing company.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated that we didn\u2019t get the services that we needed,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that we have had to suffer.\u201d",
      "Sharon Burks, who lives at Commons of Grace, said it became unbearable when the power went out. She is 63 and uses a breathing machine for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which causes shortness of breath. She had to resort to her battery-powered breathing pump, which isn\u2019t meant to be used for long periods.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything from CenterPoint,\" Burks said. \"We\u2019re always the last to get it.\u201d"

      "\u201cI tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,\u201d Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container.",
      "To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.",
      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",

      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress.

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 00:02:21 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a critic of COVID-19 health measures to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a critic of COVID-19 health measures to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Friday nominated Dr. Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, selecting a surgeon and author who gained national attention for opposing vaccine mandates and some other public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who have declared the U.S. health system \u201cbroken,\" vowing a shakeup. As part of a flurry of nominations late Friday night, Trump also tapped doctor and former Republican Rep. Dave Weldon of Florida to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fox News contributor Janette Nesheiwat, meanwhile, is set to be the nation's next surgeon general.",
      "Some of Makary's views align closely with the man who is poised to be his boss \u2014 prominent environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine organizer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump put forward as the next U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary.",
      "In books and articles, Makary has decried the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators, points that Kennedy has also harped on for years.",
      "Trump said Makary, trained as a surgeon and cancer specialist, \u201cwill restore FDA to the gold standard of scientific research, and cut the bureaucratic red tape at the agency to make sure Americans get the medical cures and treatments they deserve.\u201d",
      "Headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, the 18,000 employees of the FDA are responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and medical devices as well as a swath of other consumer goods, including food, cosmetics and vaping products. Altogether those products represent an estimated 20% of U.S. consumer spending annually, or $2.6 trillion.",
      "Makary gained prominence on Fox News and other conservative outlets for his contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic. He questioned the need for masking and, though not opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, had concerns about booster vaccinations in young children. He was part of a vocal group of physicians calling for greater emphasis on herd immunity to stop the virus, or the idea that mass infections would quickly lead to population-level protection.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that COVID-19 vaccinations prevented more than 686,000 U.S. deaths in 2020 and 2021 alone. While children faced much lower rates of hospitalization and death from the virus, medical societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that vaccinations significantly reduced severe disease in the age group.",
      "Makary has lamented how drugmakers used misleading data to urge doctors to prescribe OxyContin and other opioids as low-risk, non-addictive pain relievers. That marketing was permitted under FDA-approved labeling from the 1990s, suggesting the drugs were safe for common ailments like back pain.",
      "In more recent years, the FDA has come under fire for approving drugs for Alzheimer's, ALS and other conditions based on incomplete data that failed to show meaningful benefits for patients.",
      "A push toward greater scrutiny of drug safety and effectiveness would be a major reversal at FDA, which for decades has focused on speedier drug approvals. That trend has been fueled by industry lobbying and fees paid by drugmakers to help the FDA hire additional reviewers.",
      "Kennedy has proposed ending those payments, which would require billions in new funding from the federal budget.",
      "Other administration priorities would likely run into similar roadblocks. For instance, Kennedy wants to bar drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar market that supports many TV and cable networks. The Supreme Court and other conservative judges would likely overturn such a ban on First Amendment grounds that protect commercial speech, experts note.",
      "Less is known about Trump's pick for the Atlanta-based CDC, which develops vaccines and monitors for infectious disease outbreaks.",
      "Weldon is a staunch, self-described \u201cpro-life\u201d Republican. Legislation he introduced more than 20 years ago outlawed human cloning. He also brokered a deal with lawmakers to bar patents on human organisms, including genetically engineered embryos. Weldon also advocated against the removal of the feeding tube for Terri Schiavo, a Florida woman whose family battle over her vegetative state turned into a national debate.",
      "Weldon's nomination is likely to placate some anti-abortion advocates, who have been concerned about Trump's nomination of Kennedy, a longtime Democrat and proponent of abortion rights, as the nation's top health official.",
      "Weldon retired from his congressional seat in 2008, after 14 years in public office. Earlier this year, he lost in a GOP primary for a seat in the Florida Legislature.",
      "If he's confirmed, he'll be in charge of more than 13,000 employees and nearly 13,000 other contract workers.",
      "Nesheiwat, meanwhile, will oversee 6,000 U.S. Public Health Service Corps members if the Republican-controlled Senate approves her nomination as the surgeon general. She is a medical director for an urgent care company in New York. She appears regularly on Fox News and has expressed frequent support for Trump, sharing photos of them together on her social media pages.",
      "Surgeons general also have the power to issue advisories, warning of public health threats in the U.S. Those advisories can influence how the government, public and medical community respond to health crises in the country.",

      "Donald Trump's health team picks include a retired congressman, a surgeon and a former talk-show host",
      "The team that President-elect Donald Trump has selected to lead federal health agencies in his second administration includes a retired congressman, a surgeon and a former talk-show host.",
      "All could play pivotal roles in fulfilling a political agenda that could change how the government goes about safeguarding Americans' health \u2014 from health care and medicines to food safety and science research. In line to lead the Department of Health and Human Services secretary is environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine organizer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Trump's choices don't have experience running large bureaucratic agencies, but they know how to talk about health on TV.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid pick Dr. Mehmet Oz hosted a talk show for 13 years and is a well-known wellness and lifestyle influencer. The pick for the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Marty Makary, and for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, are frequent Fox News contributors.",
      "Many on the list were critical of COVID-19 measures like masking and booster vaccinations for young people. Some of them have ties to Florida like many of Trump's other Cabinet nominees: Dave Weldon, the pick for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, represented the state in Congress for 14 years and is affiliated with a medical group on the state's Atlantic coast. Nesheiwat's brother-in-law is Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., tapped by Trump as national security adviser.",
      "Here's a look at the nominees' potential role in carrying out what Kennedy says is the task to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies, which have an overall $1.7 trillion budget, employ 80,000 scientists, researchers, doctors and other officials, and effect Americans' daily lives:",
      "The Atlanta-based CDC, with a $9.2 billion core budget, is charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats.",
      "Kennedy has long attacked vaccines and criticized the CDC, repeatedly alleging corruption at the agency. He said on a 2023 podcast that there is \"no vaccine that is safe and effective,\u201d and urged people to resist the CDC's guidelines about if and when kids should get vaccinated. The World Health Organization estimates that vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives over the past 50 years, and that 100 million of them were infants.",
      "Decades ago, Kennedy found common ground with Weldon, 71, who served in the Army and worked as an internal medicine doctor before he represented a central Florida congressional district from 1995 to 2009.",
      "Starting in the early 2000s, Weldon had a prominent part in a debate about whether there was a relationship between a vaccine preservative called thimerosal and autism. He was a founding member of the Congressional Autism Caucus and tried to ban thimerosal from all vaccines. Kennedy, then a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, believed there was a tie between thimerosal and autism and also charged that the government hid documents showing the danger.",
      "Since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine. Meanwhile, study after study after study found no evidence that thimerosal caused autism.",
      "Weldon's congressional voting record suggests he may go along with Republican efforts to downsize the CDC, including to eliminate the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which works on topics like drownings, drug overdoses and shooting deaths. Weldon also voted to ban federal funding for needle-exchange programs as an approach to reduce overdoses, and the National Rifle Association gave him an \u201cA\u201d rating for his pro-gun rights voting record.",
      "Kennedy is extremely critical of the FDA, which has 18,000 employees and is responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and other medical products, as well as overseeing cosmetics, electronic cigarettes and most foods.",
      "Makary, Trump\u2019s pick to run the FDA, is closely aligned with Kennedy on several topics. The professor at Johns Hopkins University who is a trained surgeon and cancer specialist has decried the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators.",
      "Kennedy has suggested he'll clear out \u201centire\u201d FDA departments and also recently threatened to fire FDA employees for \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of a host of unsubstantiated products and therapies, including stem cells, raw milk, psychedelics and discredited COVID-era treatments like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "Makary's contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic included questioning the need for masking and giving young kids COVID-19 vaccine boosters.",
      "But anything Makary and Kennedy might want to do when it comes to unwinding FDA regulations or revoking long-standing vaccine and drug approvals would be challenging. The agency has lengthy requirements for removing medicines from the market, which are based on federal laws passed by Congress.",
      "The agency provides health care coverage for more than 160 million people through Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, and also sets Medicare payment rates for hospitals, doctors and other providers. With a $1.1 trillion budget and more than 6,000 employees, Oz has a massive agency to run if confirmed \u2014 and an agency that Kennedy hasn't talked about much when it comes to his plans.",
      "While Trump tried to scrap the Affordable Care Act in his first term, Kennedy has not taken aim at it yet. But he has been critical of Medicaid and Medicare for covering expensive weight-loss drugs \u2014 though they're not widely covered by either.",
      "Trump said during his campaign that he would protect Medicare, which provides insurance for older Americans. Oz has endorsed expanding Medicare Advantage \u2014 a privately run version of Medicare that is popular but also a source of widespread fraud \u2014 in an AARP questionnaire during his failed 2022 bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania and in a 2020 Forbes op-ed with a former Kaiser Permanente CEO.",
      "Oz also said in a Washington Examiner op-ed with three co-writers that aging healthier and living longer could help fix the U.S. budget deficit because people would work longer and add more to the gross domestic product.",
      "Neither Trump nor Kennedy have said much about Medicaid, the insurance program for low-income Americans. Trump's first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "Kennedy doesn't appear to have said much publicly about what he'd like to see from surgeon general position, which is the nation's top doctor and oversees 6,000 U.S. Public Health Service Corps members.",
      "The surgeon general has little administrative power, but can be an influential government spokesperson on what counts as a public health danger and what to do about it \u2014 suggesting things like warning labels for products and issuing advisories. The current surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, declared gun violence as a public health crisis in June.",
      "Trump's pick, Nesheiwat, is employed as a New York City medical director with CityMD, a group of urgent care facilities in the New York and New Jersey area, and has been at City MD for 12 years. She also has appeared on Fox News and other TV shows, authored a book on the \u201ctransformative power of prayer\u201d in her medical career and endorses a brand of vitamin supplements.",
      "She encouraged COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic, calling them \u201ca gift from God\u201d in a February 2021 Fox News op-ed, as well as anti-viral pills like Paxlovid. In a 2019 Q&A with the Women in Medicine Legacy Foundation, Nesheiwat said she is a \u201cfirm believer in preventive medicine\u201d and \u201ccan give a dissertation on hand-washing alone.\u201d",
      "As of Saturday, Trump had not yet named his choice to lead the National Institutes of Health, which funds medical research through grants to researchers across the nation and conducts its own research. It has a $48 billion budget.",
      "Kennedy has said he'd pause drug development and infectious disease research to shift the focus to chronic diseases. He'd like to keep NIH funding from researchers with conflicts of interest, and criticized the agency in 2017 for what he said was not doing enough research into the role of vaccines in autism \u2014 an idea that has long been debunked.",

      "Over 350 families have petitioned prosecutors or other state institutions seeking investigations into the deaths of their children, according to state media.",

    "story": [
      "A push by New York City jail officials to block people detained at Rikers Island from receiving physical mail was based on faulty fentanyl test strips that overstated the influx of contraband sent through the mail",
      "NEW YORK -- In 2022, New York City\u2019s jails commissioner, Louis Molina, issued a dire warning to local lawmakers: fentanyl was pouring into Rikers Island through the mail, he said, spurring an overdose crisis among the jail's detainees and putting guards at risk.",
      "As evidence of the insidious threat, Molina passed around a child\u2019s drawing of a reindeer, one of hundreds of seized items he said had been \u201cliterally soaked in the drug and mailed to people in custody.\u201d",
      "But that claim was based on faulty drug-testing kits with a stunning 85% false positive rate, according to a report released Wednesday by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation. The report found the city vastly overstated the prevalence of fentanyl sent by mail to detainees.",
      "When investigators retested 71 pieces of mail initially flagged by field tests as containing fentanyl, only 10 actually showed traces of the drug. The drawing of a reindeer highlighted by Molina was fentanyl-free.",
      "Field tests indicating an influx of fentanyl-laced mail to Rikers Island fueled a yearslong campaign by Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to bar people in city custody from receiving physical mail.",
      "As a replacement, city officials proposed redirecting mail to an offsite vendor, who would then upload it digitally for the incarcerated person to read on a tablet \u2014 a practice used in other correctional systems, including New York's state prisons. So far, the proposal has been blocked by a jail oversight board.",
      "Jocelyn Strauber, the commissioner of the Department of Investigation, said the city should reassess its ongoing effort to bar detainees from receiving mail, given the report\u2019s findings.",
      "\u201cThe field tests don\u2019t support a concern that a high rate of fentanyl-laced objects are coming in from the mail,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cTo the extent policy determinations are based on flawed data, they ought to be reconsidered.\u201d",
      "Detainee advocates have long contended that drugs primarily enter the jail system via employees, who can easily smuggle them inside and sell them to gang leaders. In recent years, dozens of correction officers have been charged in multiple investigations of smuggling rings on Rikers Island.",
      "In its report, the Department of Investigation said corrections officials had failed to implement many of the department's previous recommendations aimed at screening staff for contraband.",
      "In an email statement, a Department of Correction spokesperson said the agency would review the report and continue refining its testing processes. \u201cField tests are a tool used to quickly assess potential threats, and while not perfect, they play an important role in our safety protocols,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Such field tests have gained popularity in recent years alongside a spike in opioid overdose deaths nationwide, allowing law enforcement officials to bypass the lengthy lab process to determine if a substance contains narcotics.",
      "But experts have long raised questions about the strips' effectiveness. Under federal regulations, manufacturers are required to include language on their packaging indicating that results are preliminary until confirmed by a lab \u2014 something that rarely happens in correctional settings.",
      "Last November, New York\u2019s state prison system was found to have wrongly punished more than 2,000 detainees due to false positives from drug tests manufactured by Sirchie Finger Print Laboratories.",
      "For years, the test strips used on Rikers Island, the city-run jail system, were also provided by Sirchie. But after complaints about the reliability of the tests, the Department of Correction switched to kits made by DetectaChem last April.",
      "The review by the Department of Investigation found DetectaChem\u2019s test strips had a false positive rate of 79%, while Sirchie\u2019s were wrong 91% of the time.",
      "Inquiries to Sirchie were not returned.",
      "Travis Kisner, the chief operating officer of DetectaChem, said the company was still reviewing the report, but added: \u201cWe stand behind our product.\""

    "story": [
      "Disabled rideshare users have for years reported having less access to Lyft and Uber than able-bodied people",
      "Disabled people who use rideshare apps Lyft and Uber say their experience is not a seamless task of pressing a few buttons and being whisked to their destination minutes later.",
      "Instead, people who use wheelchairs and guide dogs have watched drivers cancel rides, charge cleaning fees for guide dogs or outright refuse to take them where they need to go.",
      "The rideshare companies plan to push app updates soon to address cancellations and misunderstandings, but advocates and disabled users say they want to see drivers be better educated about how to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and want the companies to put in stricter discrimination policies. The new app features are just \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d said Lynn Dubinsky.",
      "\u201cThis option puts the burden back on the client rather than on the companies themselves to directly address (discrimination) with their drivers,\u201d said Dubinsky, who works for a guide-dog training school in San Rafael, California.",
      "Uber and Lyft have been the target of past federal lawsuits that allege they didn't follow ADA laws; Uber settled its suit in 2022 and Lyft settled a separate one in 2020. While rideshare apps aren't the only option for disabled people across the U.S. \u2014 public transit agencies must also have ADA-compliant buses and trains and offer paratransit options like shuttles \u2014 the disabled community relies on rideshare more than others, according to 2022 U.S. Bureau of Transportation statistics.",
      "That's the case for Amber Sherrard, who is blind and has a guide dog named Della.",
      "The 32-year-old Denver resident has grown accustomed to drivers refusing to transport Della, whom she prefers to bring along instead of using a cane, which she says is less safe. Once, she ended up getting a ride from strangers at Denver's airport because a rideshare driver wouldn't allow Della in the car.",
      "Uber's app update will give users a way to identify as blind or deaf. Lyft will allow users to tell a driver they have a service animal \u2014 something that Uber launched as a small pilot program earlier this week in the U.S. and Canada. Both rideshare companies have hotlines for people to report drivers who refuse to allow them into their cars with a service animal.",
      "Sherrard said she's skeptical that the new app features will help, since she usually informs drivers about her guide dog and figured out how to add that she's visually impaired to her profile name to cut down on cancellations.",
      "\u201cJust like every other person in America working multiple jobs, trying to survive, I don\u2019t have the time,\u201d she said of drivers who've denied her rides. \u201cI have just as many bills as anyone else. I have just as many working hours as everyone else. I have just as many errands and things to do to survive as anyone else.\u201d",
      "Robert Silva has had issues with rideshare drivers because of his folding wheelchair, which he has used since losing his right leg in a car accident. The 34-year-old from Alameda, California, said he once tried ordering a rideshare five times in an hour and a half to go to Disneyland before a driver accepted his request.",
      "\u201cThey just see me in a wheelchair, first thing, and they\u2019re expecting that there\u2019s going to be a lot of baggage there,\u201d said Silva, who usually can get into a vehicle without assistance. \u201cI\u2019m sure when they see me they think it\u2019s going to be a lot more work than it actually is.\u201d",
      "Uber and Lyft said their disability policies include following the ADA and not denying rides to people solely because they have a guide dog. The companies also said new drivers are made aware of the policies during onboarding, and that established drivers get occasional reminders of disability policies. If drivers wrongfully decline to accommodate riders because of a service animal, they face a potential ban.",
      "Under the ADA, U.S. cities that have public transportation must provide paratransit at a comparable cost to the regular transit system.",
      "Cathy Johnston, 70, uses Atlanta's MARTA Mobility paratransit program so she doesn't have to leave her power wheelchair behind for a foldable wheelchair like she does when using Uber or Lyft. It's not as timely as rideshare; Johnston said she's had to wait up to 45 minutes \u2014 even after scheduling it at least 24 hours in advance.",
      "\u201cIt makes me mad because hey, I have things I have to do,\u201d she said.",
      "In recent years, 36 transportation programs in 15 states and Washington, D.C., have bolstered paratransit offerings with Uzurv, a rideshare company that specializes in door-to-door service for people with disabilities. The company says it immediately bans drivers who discriminate against disabled riders.",
      "Portland, Oregon, lost a third of its cab fleet because of a drop in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon after, TriMet, the city\u2019s public transit operation, signed a contract with Uzurv.",
      "It's been an \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d solution that Eileen Collins Turvey, TriMet's director of accessibility programs, is satisfied with \u2014 so much so that she hopes to make it an on-demand service next year.",
      "But first, she wants to be able to expand all paratransit contractors\u2019 ability to serve wheelchair users.",

      "Most people taking popular drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy to lose weight have shed significant pounds",
      "Unlike scores of people who scrambled for the blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy to lose weight in recent years, Danielle Griffin had no trouble getting them.",
      "The 38-year-old information technology worker from New Mexico had a prescription. Her pharmacy had the drugs in stock. And her health insurance covered all but $25 to $50 of the monthly cost.",
      "For Griffin, the hardest part of using the new drugs wasn\u2019t access. It was finding out that the much-hyped medications didn\u2019t really work for her.",
      "\u201cI have been on Wegovy for a year and a half and have only lost 13 pounds,\u201d said Griffin, who watches her diet, drinks plenty of water and exercises regularly. \u201cI\u2019ve done everything right with no success. It\u2019s discouraging.\u201d",
      "In clinical trials, most participants taking Wegovy or Mounjaro to treat obesity lost an average of 15% to 22% of their body weight \u2014 up to 50 pounds or more in many cases. But roughly 10% to 15% of patients in those trials were \u201cnonresponders\u201d who lost less than 5% of their body weight.",
      "Now that millions of people have used the drugs, several obesity experts told The Associated Press that perhaps 20% of patients \u2014 as many as 1 in 5 \u2014 may not respond well to the medications. It's a little-known consequence of the obesity drug boom, according to doctors who caution eager patients not to expect one-size-fits-all results.",
      "\u201cIt's all about explaining that different people have different responses,\u201d said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity expert at Massachusetts General Hospital",
      "The drugs are known as GLP-1 receptor agonists because they mimic a hormone in the body known as glucagon-like peptide 1. Genetics, hormones and variability in how the brain regulates energy can all influence weight \u2014 and a person's response to the drugs, Stanford said. Medical conditions such as sleep apnea can prevent weight loss, as can certain common medications, such as antidepressants, steroids and contraceptives.",
      "\u201cThis is a disease that stems from the brain,\u201d said Stanford. \u201cThe dysfunction may not be the same\u201d from patient to patient.",
      "Despite such cautions, patients are often upset when they start getting the weekly injections but the numbers on the scale barely budge.",
      "\u201cIt can be devastating,\u201d said Dr. Katherine Saunders, an obesity expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-founder of the obesity treatment company FlyteHealth. \u201cWith such high expectations, there\u2019s so much room for disappointment.\u201d",
      "That was the case for Griffin, who has battled obesity since childhood and hoped to shed 70 pounds using Wegovy. The drug helped reduce her appetite and lowered her risk of diabetes, but she saw little change in weight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an emotional roller coaster,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want it to work like it does for everybody else.\u201d",
      "The medications are typically prescribed along with eating behavior and lifestyle changes.",
      "It\u2019s usually clear within weeks whether someone will respond to the drugs, said Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrine specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Weight loss typically begins right away and continues as the dosage increases.",
      "For some patients, that just doesn't happen. For others, side effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea force them to halt the medications, Dushay said. In such situations, patients who were counting on the new drugs to pare pounds may think they\u2019re out of options.",
      "\u201cI tell them: It's not game over,\u201d Dushay said.",
      "Trying a different version of the new class of drugs may help. Griffin, who didn't respond well to Wegovy, has started using Zepbound, which targets an additional hormone pathway in the body. After three months of using the drug, she has lost 7 pounds.",
      "\u201cI'm hoping it's slow and steady,\u201d she said.",
      "Other people respond well to older drugs, the experts said. Changing diet, exercise, sleep and stress habits can also have profound effects. Figuring out what works typically requires a doctor trained to treat obesity, Saunders noted.",
      "\u201cObesity is such a complex disease that really needs to be treated very comprehensively,\u201d she said. \u201cIf what we\u2019re prescribing doesn\u2019t work, we always have a backup plan.\u201d",

The town health officials refused to comment, saying they lacked proper permission.",
      "Methanol is sometimes added to mixed drinks at disreputable bars as a cheaper alternative to ethanol, but can cause severe poisoning or death. It is also a byproduct of poorly distilled homebrew liquor, and could have found its way into bar drinks inadvertently.",

      "EPWORTH, Zimbabwe -- Carrying her infant daughter, 19-year-old Sithulisiwe Moyo waited two hours to get birth-control pills from a tent pitched in a poor settlement on the outskirts of Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "The outreach clinic in Epworth provides Moyo with her best shot at achieving her dream of returning to school. \u201cI am too young to be a baby-making machine,\" she said. \"At least this clinic helps me avoid another pregnancy.\u201d",
      "But the free service funded by the U.S. government, the world\u2019s largest health donor, might soon be unavailable.",
      "As he did in his first term, U.S President-elect Donald Trump is likely in January to invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that bars U.S. foreign aid from being used to perform abortions or provide abortion information. The policy cuts off American government funding for services that women around the world rely on to avoid pregnancy or to space out their children, as well as for heath care unrelated to abortion.",
      "The gag rule has a 40-year history of being applied by Republican presidents and rescinded by Democratic presidents. Every GOP president since the mid-1980s has invoked the rule, which is known as the Mexico City Policy for the city where it was first announced.",
      "As one of his first acts as president in 2017, Trump expanded the rule to the extent that foreign NGOs were cut off from about $600 million in U.S. family planning funds and more than $11 billion in U.S. global health aid between 2017 and 2018 alone, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.",
      "The money \u2014 much of it intended for Africa \u2014 covered efforts such as preventing malaria and tuberculosis, providing water and sanitation, and distributing health information and contraception, which might also have repercussions for HIV prevention.",
      "Women\u2019s health advocates are \u201cuneasy\u201d following Trump\u2019s victory, said Pester Siraha, director of Population Services Zimbabwe, an affiliate of MSI Reproductive Choices, an NGO that supports abortion rights in 36 countries.",
      "The policy stipulates that foreign NGOs that receive U.S government funding must agree to stop abortion-related activities, including discussing it as a family planning option \u2014 even when they are using non-U.S. government funds for such activities. During Trump's first term, MSI did not agree to those conditions, effectively making it ineligible for U.S government funding.",
      "Siraha said that a blueprint offered to Trump by the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation in its plan known as Project 2025 indicates that the new administration could enact \u201ca more comprehensive global gag rule.\u201d",
      "Even NGOs in countries that outlaw abortion, such as Zimbabwe, are affected. Population Services Zimbabwe, for instance, closed its outreach clinics during Trump\u2019s first term after losing funding due to its association with MSI Reproductive Choices. Such outreach clinics are often the only health care option for rural people with limited access to hospitals due to poverty or distance.",
      "\u201cIt leaves women with no place to turn for help, even for information,\u201d said Whitney Chinogwenya, global marketing manager at MSI Reproductive Choices.",
      "Some NGOs in other African countries such as Uganda, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa rolled back services, including clinics, contraception, training and support for government and community health workers, as well as programs for young people, sex workers and LGBTIQ+ communities.",
      "Other services shut down entirely. The risk of unplanned pregnancies, unsafe abortions and related deaths increased in many of the affected countries, according to the U.S.-based Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.",
      "Chinogwenya, the MSI Reproductive Choices marketing manager, said her organization\u2019s donor income dropped by $120 million during Trump\u2019s first term. The money would have provided 8 million women globally with family planning help, preventing 6 million unintended pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 pregnancy-related deaths, she said.",
      "The gag-rule policy \u201cleads to more unintended, unwanted, unsupportable pregnancies and therefore an increase in abortion,\u201d said Catriona Macleod, a professor of psychology at South Africa\u2019s Rhodes University.",
      "\u201cThis legislation does not protect life \u2026 it\u2019s been called America\u2019s deadly export,\u201d said Macleod, who heads the university\u2019s studies in sexuality and reproduction.",
      "Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "President Joe Biden rescinded the gag-rule policy in 2021, resulting in Population Services Zimbabwe receiving $9 million, about 50% of its donor funding, from USAID in 2023. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t regained all the loss we suffered,\u201d said Siraha, the organization\u2019s director.",
      "\u201cYou need a minimum of five years to have an impact. If we then have another gap of five years, it means we are reversing all the gains,\u201d she said.",
      "Her organization estimates that 1.3 million women could lose out on the care they need in Zimbabwe, leading to an additional 461,000 unintended pregnancies and 1,400 maternal deaths if the gag rule is reinstated.",
      "Overseas aid budget cuts by other Western governments will make it harder to find alternative funding, Siraha said.",
      "MSI Reproductive Choices is lobbying world leaders and alternative donors to fight for abortion rights.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s reelection may embolden the anti-choice movement, but the fight for women\u2019s reproductive rights is nonnegotiable,\u201d Chinogwenya said.",
      "However, agencies that rely heavily or entirely on U.S funding might have little choice but \u201cto quiet their guidelines on access to abortion\u201d to qualify for funding, said Denise Horn, an international relations and civil society expert at Bryant University in Rhode Island.",
      "In South Africa, where abortion is mostly legal, some NGOs, especially those without alternative funding, stopped openly discussing abortion as an option or changed their guidelines and the information they share publicly, according to an assessment by South Africa\u2019s Rhodes University and the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition, a New York-based NGO.",
      "\u201cOrganizations thus have to evaluate what is most important: the non-abortion work they will still be able to do or the principle of pro-choice,\u201d read part of the 2019 assessment report. \u201cUltimately, these organizations will have to make this difficult decision.\u201d",
      "The long lines of women at the outreach clinic in Zimbabwe\u2019s Epworth settlement underline the dire need for family planning services in impoverished communities.",
      "Engeline Mukanya, 30, said she is already struggling to support her three children with the $100 she earns monthly from plaiting women\u2019s hair. Nurses inserted a birth-control implant in her left arm to protect her from pregnancy for the next five years.",
      "Like many here, she cannot afford private providers who charge $20 to $60.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we are so far away from America yet we are being caught in the crossfire of its politics,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we want is the freedom to space our births.\u201d"

      "Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel recalls Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cpower games\u201d over the years, remembers contrasting meetings with Barack Obama and Donald Trump and says she asked herself whether she could have done more to prevent Brexit",
      "BERLIN -- Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel recalls Vladimir Putin's \u201cpower games\u201d over the years, remembers contrasting meetings with Barack Obama and Donald Trump and says she asked herself whether she could have done more to prevent Brexit, in her memoirs published Tuesday.",
      "Merkel, 70, appears to have no significant doubts about the major decisions of her 16 years as German leader, whose major challenges included the global financial crisis, Europe\u2019s debt crisis, the 2015-16 influx of refugees and the COVID-19 pandemic. True to form, her book \u2014 titled \u201cFreedom\u201d \u2014 offers a matter-of-fact account of her early life in communist East Germany and her later career in politics, laced with moments of dry wit.",
      "Merkel served alongside four U.S. presidents, four French presidents and five British prime ministers. But it is perhaps her dealings with Russian President Putin that have drawn the most scrutiny since she left office in late 2021.",
      "Merkel recalls being kept waiting by Putin at the Group of Eight summit she hosted in 2007 \u2014 \u201cif there's one thing I can't stand, it's unpunctuality.\u201d And she recounts a visit to the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi that year in which Putin's labrador appeared during a photo opportunity, although Putin knew she was afraid of dogs.",
      "Putin appeared to enjoy the situation, she writes, and she didn't bring it up \u2014 keeping as she often did to the motto \u201cnever explain, never complain.\u201d",
      "The previous year, she recounts Putin pointing to wooden houses in Siberia and telling her poor people lived there who \u201ccould be easily seduced,\u201d and that similar groups had been encouraged by money from the U.S. government to take part in Ukraine's \u201cOrange Revolution\u201d of 2004 against attempted election fraud. Putin, she says, added: \u201cI will never allow something like that in Russia.\u201d",
      "Merkel says she was irritated by Putin's \u201cself-righteousness\u201d in a 2007 speech in Munich in which he turned away from earlier attempts to develop closer ties with the U.S. She said that appearance showed Putin as she knew him, \u201cas someone who was always on guard against being treated badly and ready to give out at any time, including power games with a dog and making other people wait for him.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne could find this all childish and reprehensible, one could shake one's head over it \u2014 but that didn't make Russia disappear from the map,\u201d she writes.",
      "As she has before, Merkel defends a much-criticized 2015 peace deal for eastern Ukraine that she helped broker and her government's decisions to buy large quantities of natural gas from Russia. And she argues it was right to keep up diplomatic and trade ties with Moscow until she left power,",
      "Merkel concluded after first meeting then-Sen. Obama in 2008 that they could work well together. More than eight years later, during his last visit as president in Nov. 2016, she was one of the people with whom she discussed whether to seek a fourth term.",
      "Obama, she says, asked questions but held back with an opinion, and that in itself was helpful. He \u201csaid that Europe could still use me very well, but I should ultimately follow my feelings,\u201d she writes.",
      "There was no such warmth with Trump, who had criticized Merkel and Germany in his 2016 campaign. Merkel says she had to seek an \u201cadequate relationship ... without reacting to all the provocations.\u201d",
      "In March 2017, there was an awkward moment when Merkel first visited the Trump White House. Photographers shouted \u201chandshake!\u201d and Merkel quietly asked Trump: \u201cDo you want to have a handshake?\u201d There was no response from Trump, who looked ahead with his hands clasped.",
      "Merkel faults her own reaction. \u201cHe wanted to create a topic of discussion with his behavior, while I had acted as if I were dealing with an interlocutor behaving normally,\u201d she writes. She adds that Putin apparently \u201cfascinated\u201d Trump and, in the following years, she had the impression that \u201cpoliticians with autocratic and dictatorial traits\u201d beguiled him.",
      "Merkel says she tried to help then-Prime Minister David Cameron in the European Union as he faced pressure from British Euroskeptics, but there were limits to what she could do. And, pointing to Cameron's efforts over the years to assuage opponents of the EU, she says the road to Brexit is a textbook example of what can arise from a miscalculation.",
      "After Britons voted to leave the EU in 2016, an outcome she calls a \u201chumiliation\u201d for its other members, she says the question of whether she should have made more concessions to the U.K. \u201ctortured me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI came to the conclusion that, in view of the political developments inside the country at the time, there would have been no acceptable possibility for me to prevent Britain's way out of the European Union from outside,\u201d Merkel says.",
      "Merkel was the first German chancellor to leave power at a time of her choosing. She announced in 2018 that she wouldn't seek a fifth term, and says she \u201clet go at the right point.\u201d",
      "She points to three 2019 incidents in which her body shook during public engagements as proof. Merkel says she had herself checked thoroughly and there were no neurological or other findings. An osteopath told her that her body was letting off the tension it had accumulated over years, she adds.",
      "\u201cFreedom\u201d runs to more than 700 pages in its original German edition, published by Kiepenheuer & Witsch. The English edition is being released simultaneously by St. Martin's Press."

      "The Lebanese civilians most devastated by the Israel-Hezbollah war are Shiite Muslims, and many of them believe they are being unfairly punished because they share a religious identity with Hezbollah militants and often live in the same areas",
      "BEIRUT -- The Lebanese civilians most devastated by the Israel- Hezbollah war are Shiite Muslims, and many of them believe they are being unfairly punished because they share a religious identity with Hezbollah militants and often live in the same areas.",
      "\u201cThis is clear,\u201d said Wael Murtada, a young Shiite man who anxiously watched paramedics search rubble after a recent Israeli airstrike destroyed his uncle\u2019s two-story home and killed 10 people. \u201cWho else is being attacked?\u201d",
      "Israel has concentrated its attacks on villages in southern and northeastern Lebanon and neighborhoods south of Beirut. This is where many Hezbollah militants operate from, and their families live side by side with large numbers of Shiites who aren\u2019t members of the group.",
      "Israel insists its war is with Hezbollah and not the Lebanese people \u2013 or the Shiite faith. It says it only targets members of the Iran-backed militant group to try to end their yearlong campaign of firing rockets over the border. But Israel\u2019s stated objectives mean little to people like Murtada as growing numbers of Shiite civilians also die in a war that escalated sharply in recent months.",
      "Shiites don\u2019t just measure the suffering of their community in deaths and injuries. Entire blocks of the coastal city of Tyre have been flattened. Large parts of the historic market in the city of Nabatiyeh, which dates to the Ottoman era, have been destroyed. And in Baalbek, an airstrike damaged the city\u2019s famed Hotel Palmyra, which opened in the late 19th century, and a home that dates to the Ottoman era.",
      "\u201cLebanese Shias are being collectively punished. Their urban areas are being destroyed, and their cultural monuments and building are being destroyed,\u201d said Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.",
      "As Shiites flee their war-torn villages and neighborhoods, the conflict is increasingly following them to other parts of Lebanon, and this is fueling tensions.",
      "Scores of people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes on Christian, Sunni and Druze areas where displaced Shiites had taken refuge. Many residents in these areas now think twice before providing shelter to displaced people out of fear they may have links to Hezbollah.",
      "\u201cThe Israelis are targeting all of Lebanon,\u201d said Wassef Harakeh, a lawyer from Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs who in 2022 ran against Hezbollah in the country\u2019s parliamentary elections and whose office was recently demolished by an Israeli airstrike. He believes part of Israel\u2019s goal is to exacerbate frictions within the small Mediterranean country, which has a long history of sectarian fighting even though diverse groups live together peacefully these days.",
      "Some Shiites say statements from the Israeli military over the years have only reinforced suspicions that their wider community is being targeted as a means to put pressure on Hezbollah.",
      "One commonly cited example is the so-called Dahiyeh doctrine, which was first espoused by Israeli generals during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. It is a reference to the southern suburbs of Beirut where Hezbollah is headquartered and where entire residential blocks, bridges and shopping compounds were destroyed in both wars. Israel says Hezbollah hides weapons and fighters in such areas, turning them into legitimate military targets.",
      "A video released by the Israeli military last month has been interpreted by Shiites as further proof that little distinction is being made between Hezbollah fighters and Shiite civilians.",
      "Speaking from a southern Lebanese village he did not name, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari called it \u201ca terror base. This is a Lebanese village, a Shiite village built by Hezbollah.\u201d As he toured a house and showed stocks of hand grenades, rifles, night-vision goggles and other military equipment, Hagari said: \u201cEvery house is a terror base.\u201d",
      "Another army spokesperson disputed the notion that Israel tries to blur the line between combatants and civilians. \u201cOur war is with the terror group Hezbollah and not with the Lebanese population, whatever its origin,\u201d said Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani. He denied that Israel was intentionally trying to disrupt the social fabric of Lebanon, and pointed to Israel\u2019s evacuation warnings to civilians ahead of airstrikes as a step it takes to mitigate harm.",
      "Many Lebanese, including some Shiites, blame Hezbollah for their suffering, while also decrying Israel\u2019s bombardments. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel last year the day after Hamas attacked Israel and started the war in Gaza; this went against the group's promises to use its weapons only to defend Lebanon.",
      "Since last October, more than 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon, and women and children accounted for more than 900 of the dead, according to the Health Ministry. More than 1 million people have been displaced from their homes. Shiites, who make up a third of Lebanon\u2019s 5 million people, have borne the brunt of this suffering. Israel says it has killed well over 2,000 Hezbollah members in the past year.",
      "The death and destruction in Lebanon ramped up significantly in mid-September, when Israeli airstrikes began targeting Hezbollah\u2019s leaders, and once again in early October, when Israeli ground troops invaded.",
      "Early in the war, Israeli airstrikes killed about 500 Hezbollah members but caused very little collateral damage. But since late September, airstrikes have destroyed entire buildings and homes, and in some cases killed dozens of civilians when the intended target was one Hezbollah member or official.",
      "On one particularly bloody day, Sept. 23, Israeli airstrikes killed almost 500 people and prompted hundreds of thousands of people \u2013 again, mostly Shiites -- to flee their homes in panic.",
      "Murtada\u2019s relatives fled from Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in late September after entire blocks had been wiped out by airstrikes. They moved 22 kilometers (about 14 miles) east of the city, to the predominantly Druze mountain village of Baalchmay to stay in the home of Murtada\u2019s uncle.",
      "Then, on Nov. 12, the home where they sought refuge was destroyed without warning. The airstrike killed nine relatives \u2014 three men, three women and three children \u2014 and a domestic worker, Murtada said.",
      "The Israeli army said the home was being used by Hezbollah. Murtada, who lost a grandmother and an aunt in the strike, said nobody in the home was connected to the militant group.",
      "Hezbollah has long boasted about its ability to deter Israel, but the latest war has proven otherwise and taken a severe toll on its leadership.",
      "Some Shiites fear the weakening of Hezbollah will lead to the entire community being sidelined politically once the war is over. But others believe it could offer a political opening for more diverse Shiite voices.",
      "Cease-fire negotiations to end the Israel-Hezbollah appear to have gained momentum over the past week. Some critics of Hezbollah say the group could have accepted months ago the conditions currently under consideration.",
      "This would have spared Lebanon \u201cdestruction, martyrs and losses worth billions (of dollars),\u201d Lebanese legislator Waddah Sadek, who is Sunni Muslim, wrote on X.",

      "Uruguay\u2019s leftist opposition candidate, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, became the country's new president in a tight runoff election that ousted the conservative governing coalition",
      "MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay -- Uruguay's leftist opposition candidate, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, became the country's new president in a tight runoff Sunday, ousting the conservative governing coalition and making the South American nation the latest to rebuke the incumbent party in a year of landmark elections worldwide.",
      "Even as the vote count continued, \u00c1lvaro Delgado, the presidential candidate for the center-right ruling coalition, conceded defeat to his challenger while surrounded by sullen-looking family members and colleagues.",
      "\u201cThe country of liberty, equality and fraternity has triumphed once again,\u201d Orsi said to sprawling crowds of supporters that waved flags and shouted their support. \u201cI will be the president who calls for national dialogue again and again, who builds a more integrated society and country.\u201d",
      "As initial exit polls began showing Orsi, 57, a working-class former history teacher and two-time mayor from Uruguay\u2019s Broad Front coalition, holding a lead over Delgado, cheers rang out across Montevideo\u2019s beaches.",
      "Delgado told supporters gathered at his own party\u2019s headquarters in the capital of Montevideo that he had lost. The crowd was hushed.",
      "\u201cWith sadness, but without guilt, we can congratulate the winner,\u201d he told them. \"But it's one thing to lose the elections and another to be defeated. We are not defeated,\" he added, generating a burst of applause.",
      "A political heir to former President Jos\u00e9 \u201cPepe\u201d Mujica, an ex-Marxist guerilla who became a global icon for transforming Uruguay into one of the most liberal and environmentally sustainable nations in the region, Orsi rode to power on promises of safe change and nostalgia for his left-wing party's redistributive social policies.",
      "He struck a conciliatory tone, vowing to unite the nation of 3.4 million people after such a tight vote.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s understand that there is another part of our country who have different feelings today,\u201d he said, as fireworks erupted over his stage overlooking the city's waterfront. \u201cThese people will also have to help build a better country. We need them too.\u201d",
      "With nearly all the votes counted, electoral officials reported that Orsi won 49.8% of the vote, ahead of Delgado\u2019s 45.9%, a clear call after weeks in which the opponents appeared tied in polls.",
      "The rest cast blank votes or abstained in defiance of Uruguay\u2019s enforced compulsory voting. Turnout in the nation with 2.7 million eligible voters reached almost 90%.",
      "Analysts say that the candidates' lackluster campaigns failed to entice apathetic young people and generated unusual levels of voter indecision.",
      "But with the rivals in broad consensus over key issues, the level-headed election was also emblematic of Uruguay's strong and stable democracy, free of the anti-establishment fury that has vaulted populist outsiders to power elsewhere, like the United States and neighboring Argentina.",
      "Orsi's win ushers in a return of the Broad Front that governed for 15 consecutive years until the 2019 election of center-right President Luis Lacalle Pou.",
      "\u201cI called Yamand\u00fa Orsi to congratulate him as President-elect of our country and to put myself at his service and begin the transition as soon as I deem it appropriate,\u201d Lacalle Pou wrote on social media platform X.",
      "The opposition's upset was the latest sign that simmering discontent over post-pandemic economic malaise favors anti-incumbent candidates. In the many elections that took place during 2024, voters frustrated with the status quo have punished ruling parties from the U.S. and Britain to South Korea and Japan.",
      "But unlike elsewhere in the world, Orsi is a moderate with no plans for dramatic change. He largely agrees with his opponent on driving down the childhood poverty rate, now at a staggering 25%, and containing an upsurge in organized crime that has shaken the nation long considered among Latin America's safest.",
      "Orsi is also likely to scupper a trade agreement with China that Lacalle Pou pursued to the chagrin of Mercosur, an alliance of South American nations promoting regional commerce.",
      "Despite Orsi's promise to lead a \u201cnew left\u201d in Uruguay, his platform resembles the mix of market-friendly policies and welfare programs initiated under President Mujica and other Broad Front leaders.",
      "From 2005-2020, the coalition presided over a period of robust economic growth and pioneering social reforms that won widespread international acclaim, including the legalization of abortion, same-sex marriage and sale of marijuana.",
      "Mujica, now 89 and recovering from esophageal cancer, turned up at his local polling station before balloting even began on Sunday to praise Orsi\u2019s humility and Uruguay\u2019s proud stability.",
      "\u201cThis is no small feat,\u201d he said of his nation's \u201ccitizenry that respects formal institutions.\u201d",
      "Orsi, who for a decade served as mayor of Canelones \u2014 a town of beaches and cattle ranches also home to a Google data center and upstart tech scene \u2014 proposes tax incentives to lure investment and revitalize the critical agricultural sector. He supports security reforms that would lower the retirement age but fall short of a radical overhaul sought by Uruguay\u2019s unions that failed to pass in the Oct. 27 general election.",
      "In that first round of voting \u2014 in which neither front-runner secured an outright majority \u2014 voters rejected generous pay-outs and the redistribution of privately managed pension funds in a rare gesture of fiscal constraint.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s my candidate, not only for my sake but also for my children\u2019s,\u201d said Yeny Varone, a nurse at a polling station who voted for Orsi. \u201cIn the future they\u2019ll have better working conditions, health and salaries.\u201d",
      "Delgado, 55, a rural veterinarian with a long career in the National Party, served most recently as Secretary of the Presidency for Lacalle Pou and campaigned under the slogan \u201cre-elect a good government.\u201d",
      "With inflation easing and the economy expected to expand by over 3% this year, Delgado promised to continue his predecessor\u2019s pro-business policies. Lacalle Pou, who constitutionally cannot run for a second consecutive term, enjoyed high approval ratings, around 50%.",
      "Sunday's outcome showed Uruguayans' growing discontent with the government's failure to reverse a decade of sluggish economic growth and contain crime over the past five years. Some also attributed Delgado's loss to his lack of charisma and weak campaign strategy.",

      "An international human rights group says an Israeli airstrike that killed three journalists and wounded others in Lebanon last month was most likely a deliberate attack on civilians and an apparent war crime",
      "BEIRUT -- An Israeli airstrike that killed three journalists and wounded others in Lebanon last month was most likely a deliberate attack on civilians and an apparent war crime, an international human rights group said Monday.",
      "The Oct. 25 airstrike killed three journalists as they slept at a guesthouse in southeast Lebanon in one of the deadliest attacks on the media since the Israel-Hezbollah war began 13 months ago.",
      "Eleven other journalists have been killed and eight wounded since then, Lebanon's Health Minister Firass Abiad said.",
      "More than 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon, and women and children accounted for more than 900 of the dead, according to the Health Ministry. More than 1 million people have been displaced since Israeli ground troops invaded while Hezbollah has been firing thousands of rockets, drones and missiles into Israel \u2014 and drawing fierce Israeli retaliatory strikes.",
      "Human Rights Watch determined that Israeli forces carried out the Oct. 25 attack using an air-dropped bomb equipped with a U.S.-produced Joint Direct Attack Munition, or JDAM, guidance kit.",
      "The group said the U.S. government should suspend weapons transfers to Israel because of the military\u2019s repeated \u201cunlawful attacks on civilians, for which U.S. officials may be complicit in war crimes.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the report.",
      "The Biden administration said in May that Israel\u2019s use of U.S.-provided weapons in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza likely violated international humanitarian law but that wartime conditions prevented U.S. officials from determining that for certain in specific airstrikes.",
      "The journalists killed in the airstrike in the southeastern town of Hasbaya were camera operator Ghassan Najjar and broadcast technician Mohammed Rida of the Beirut-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV, and camera operator Wissam Qassim, who worked for Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV.",
      "Human Rights Watch said a munition struck the single-story building and detonated upon hitting the floor.",
      "\u201cIsrael\u2019s use of U.S. arms to unlawfully attack and kill journalists away from any military target is a terrible mark on the United States as well as Israel,\u201d said Richard Weir, the senior crisis, conflict and arms researcher at Human Rights Watch.",
      "Weir added that \u201cthe Israeli military\u2019s previous deadly attacks on journalists without any consequences give little hope for accountability in this or future violations against the media.\u201d",
      "Human Rights Watch said that it found remnants at the site and reviewed photographs of pieces collected by the resort owner and determined that they were consistent with a JDAM guidance kit assembled and sold by the U.S. company Boeing.",
      "The JDAM is affixed to air-dropped bombs and allows them to be guided to a target by using satellite coordinates, making the weapon accurate to within several meters, the group said.",
      "In November 2023, two journalists for Al-Mayadeen TV were killed in a drone strike at their reporting spot. A month earlier, Israeli shelling in southern Lebanon killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and seriously wounded other journalists from France\u2019s international news agency Agence France-Presse and Qatar\u2019s Al-Jazeera TV on a hilltop not far from the Israeli border.",

      "It is the biggest sanctions package targeting the fleet of illegitimate and often decrepit ships that are operating illegally to avoid sanctions, the Foreign Office said.

      "A last round of negotiations on a legally binding treaty to address the global scourge of plastic pollution has opened in Busan, South Korea. Here's what to know about it:",
      "National delegations still have a lot to hammer out before there is a treaty. Most contentious is whether there will be a limit on the amount of plastic that companies are allowed to produce.",
      "Led by Norway and Rwanda, 66 countries plus the European Union say they want to address the total plastic on Earth by controlling plastic design, production, consumption and what happens at the end of its life.",
      "Some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, including Saudi Arabia, vigorously oppose such limits.",
      "Global plastics production is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, up 70% from 2020, without policy changes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.",
      "Negotiators must also decide whether the treaty will reduce or eliminate single-use plastics. They'll have to resolve whether to end the use of hazardous chemicals in plastics and whether these steps will be mandated or merely encouraged.",
      "Their common objective is to protect human health and the environment.",
      "There are some things many countries agree on. They want provisions in a treaty to promote the redesign of plastic products so they can be recycled and reused. They want to invest to better manage plastic waste. They want to increase recycling rates and help waste pickers transition to safer jobs. There is agreement that there needs to be a mechanism to help countries pay for anything required of them.",
      "Graham Forbes, who is leading a Greenpeace delegation in Busan, said his group could support an agreement that puts sensible guardrails in place to reduce the amount of plastic produced, eliminates toxic chemicals and protects people from the uncontrolled use of plastics. That's achievable, but will take political leadership and courage not seen yet in earlier negotiations, he added.",
      "Frankie Orona, executive director of the Texas-based Society of Native Nations, said they demand a treaty that tackles the root causes of the crisis rather than just managing plastic waste.",
      "\u201cWe must seize this moment and leave a legacy we can be proud of, with a non-toxic sustainable future for all children and our children's children,\" he said.",
      "Industry leaders want an agreement that prevents plastic pollution by redesigning plastics to be reused, recycled and remade into new products. They say this will keep the materials in circulation and out of the environment.",
      "Company executives said they'll support a treaty that recognizes plastics' benefits to society, while ending pollution.",
      "\u201cI would hate to miss this opportunity because we get fixated on issues that divide us rather than unite us in this purpose of ultimately addressing the issue of plastic pollution,\" said Steve Prusak, president and CEO of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. \"It\u2019s a really critical time. We\u2019re really hopeful that what we get out of the meetings will lead to practical, implementable policies and harmonization across the globe.\u201d",
      "U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said the treaty talks are a historic opportunity to land an agreement and course-correct, something \u201centirely within our reach.\u201d",

      "Preliminary reports, based on statements from the yacht crew and tourists, said a large wave crashed into the boat, causing it to capsize, according to the governorate\u2019s update. Some of the passengers were inside the cabins when the incident unfolded within minutes, according to the statements.",

      "BEIRUT -- Israel's military launched airstrikes across Lebanon on Monday, unleashing explosions throughout the country and killing at least 31 while Israeli leaders appeared to be closing in on a negotiated ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group.",
      "Israeli strikes hit commercial and residential buildings in Beirut as well as in the port city of Tyre. Military officials said they targeted areas known as Hezbollah strongholds. They issued evacuation orders for Beirut's southern suburbs, and strikes landed across the city, including meters from a Lebanese police base and the city's largest public park.",
      "The barrage came as officials indicated they were nearing agreement on a ceasefire, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's Security Cabinet prepared to discuss an offer on the table.",
      "Massive explosions lit up Lebanon's skies with flashes of orange, sending towering plumes of smoke into the air as Israeli airstrikes pounded Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. The blasts damaged buildings and left shattered glass and debris scattered across nearby streets. No casualties were reported after many residents fled the targeted sites.",
      "Some of the strikes landed close to central Beirut and near Christian neighborhoods and other targets where Israel had issued evacuation warnings, including in Tyre and Nabatiyeh province. Israeli airstrikes also hit the northeast Baalbek-Hermel region without warning.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry said that 26 people were killed in southern Lebanon, four in the eastern Baalbek-Hermel province and one in Choueifat, a neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs that was not subjected to evacuation warnings on Monday.",
      "The deaths brought the total toll to 3,768 killed in Lebanon throughout 13 months of war between Israel and Hezbollah and nearly two months since Israel launched its ground invasion. Many of those killed since the start of the war between Israel and Hezbollah have been civilians, and health officials said some of the recovered bodies were so severely damaged that DNA testing would be required to confirm their identities.",
      "Israel says it has killed more than 2,000 Hezbollah members. Lebanon's Health Ministry says the war has displaced 1.2 million people.",
      "Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon in early October, meeting heavy resistance in a narrow strip of land along the border. The military had previously exchanged attacks across the border with Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group that began firing rockets into Israel the day after the war in Gaza began last year.",
      "Lebanese politicians have decried the ongoing airstrikes and said they are impeding U.S.-led ceasefire negotiations. The country's deputy parliament speaker accused Israel of ramping up its bombardment in order to pressure Lebanon to make concessions in indirect ceasefire negotiations with Hezbollah.",
      "Elias Bousaab, an ally of the militant group, said the pressure has increased because \u201cwe are close to the hour that is decisive regarding reaching a ceasefire.\u201d",
      "Israeli officials voiced similar optimism about prospects for a ceasefire. Mike Herzog, the country's ambassador to Washington, earlier in the day told Israeli Army Radio that several points had yet to be finalized. Though any deal would require agreement from the government, Herzog said Israel and Hezbollah were \u201cclose to a deal.\"",
      "\u201cIt can happen within days,\u201d he said.",
      "Israeli officials have said the sides are close to an agreement that would include withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and a pullback of Hezbollah fighters from the Israeli border. But several sticking points remain.",
      "Two Israeli officials told The Associated Press that Netanyahu\u2019s security Cabinet had scheduled a meeting for Tuesday, but they said it remained unclear whether the Cabinet would vote to approve the deal. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing internal deliberations.",
      "Danny Danon, Israel\u2019s U.N. ambassador, told reporters that he expected a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah to have stages and to be discussed by leaders Monday or Tuesday. Still, he warned, \u201cit\u2019s not going to happen overnight.\u201d",
      "After previous hopes for a ceasefire were dashed, U.S. officials cautioned that negotiations were not yet complete and noted that there could be last-minute hitches that either delay or destroy an agreement.",
      "\"Nothing is done until everything is done,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said.",
      "The proposal under discussion to end the fighting calls for an initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River.",
      "The withdrawals would be accompanied by an influx of thousands more Lebanese army troops, who have been largely sidelined in the war, to patrol the border area along with an existing U.N. peacekeeping force.",
      "Western diplomats and Israeli officials said Israel is demanding the right to strike in Lebanon if it believes Hezbollah is violating the terms. The Lebanese government has said that such an arrangement would authorize violations of the country's sovereignty.",
      "A ceasefire could mark a step toward ending the regionwide war that ballooned after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250.",
      "The lack of a ceasefire has emerged as a political liability for Israeli leaders including Netanyahu, particularly while 60,000 Israelis remain away from their homes in the country's north after more than a year of cross-border violence.",
      "Hezbollah rockets have reached as far south into Israel as Tel Aviv. At least 75 people have been killed, more than half of them civilians. More than 50 Israeli soldiers died fighting in the ground offensive in Lebanon. The Israeli military said about 250 projectiles were fired Sunday, with some intercepted.",
      "A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the strongest of Iran\u2019s armed proxies, is expected to significantly calm regional tensions that have led to fears of a direct, all-out war between Israel and Iran. It\u2019s not clear how the ceasefire will affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Hezbollah had long insisted that it would not agree to a ceasefire until the war in Gaza ends, but it dropped that condition.",
      "A top Hamas official in Lebanon said the Palestinian militant group would support a ceasefire between its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and Israel, despite Hezbollah\u2019s previous promises to stop the fighting in Lebanon only if the war in Gaza ends.",
      "\u201cAny announcement of a ceasefire is welcome. Hezbollah has stood by our people and made significant sacrifices,\u201d Osama Hamdan of Hamas' political wing told the Lebanese broadcaster Al-Mayadeen, which is seen as politically allied with Hezbollah.",
      "While the ceasefire proposal is expected to be approved if Netanyahu brings it to a vote in his security Cabinet, one hard-line member, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, said he would oppose it.

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- The U.N. head, Pope Francis and others called Monday for nations to end the production and use of land mines, even as their deployment globally grows.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a message to delegates at the fifth review of the International Mine Ban Treaty, also known as the Ottawa Convention, that 25 years after it went into force some parties had renewed the use of antipersonnel mines and some are falling behind in their commitments to destroy the weapons.",
      "\u201cI call on states parties to meet their obligations and ensure compliance to the convention, while addressing humanitarian and developmental impacts through financial and technical support,\u201d Guterres said at the opening of the conference in Cambodia.",
      "\u201cI also encourage all states that have not yet acceded to the convention to join the 164 that have done so. A world without anti-personnel mines is not just possible. It is within reach.\u201d",
      "In a statement read on behalf of Pope Francis, his deputy Cardinal Pietro Parolin said that antipersonnel land mines and victim-activated explosive devices continue to be used. Even after many years of hostilities, \u201cthese treacherous devices continue to cause terrible suffering to civilians, especially children.\u201d",
      "\u201cPope Francis urges all states that have not yet done so to accede to the convention, and in the meantime to cease immediately the production and use of land mines,\u201d he said.",
      "The treaty was signed in 1997 and went into force in 1999, but nearly three dozen countries have not acceded to it, including some key current and past producers and users of land mines such as the United States, China, India, Pakistan, South Korea and Russia.",
      "In a report released last week by Landmine Monitor, the international watchdog said land mines were still actively being used in 2023 and 2024 by Russia, Myanmar, Iran and North Korea. It added that non-state armed groups in at least five places \u2014 Colombia, India, Myanmar, Pakistan and the Gaza Strip \u2014 had used mines as well, and there were claims of their use in more than a half dozen countries in or bordering the Sahel region of Africa.",
      "At least 5,757 people were killed and wounded by land mines and unexploded ordnance last year, primarily civilians of whom a third were children, Landmine Monitor reported.",
      "Landmine Monitor said Russia had been using antipersonnel mines \u201cextensively\u201d in Ukraine, and just a week ago, the U.S., which has been providing Ukraine with anti-tank mines throughout the war, announced it would start providing Kyiv with antipersonnel mines as well to try and stall Russian progress on the battlefield.",
      "\u201cAntipersonnel mines represent a clear and present danger for civilians,\u201d Guterres said in his statement. \u201cEven after fighting stops, these horrifying and indiscriminate weapons can remain, trapping generations of people in fear.\u201d",
      "He praised Cambodia for its massive demining efforts and for sharing its experience with others and contributing to U.N. peacekeeping missions.",
      "Cambodia was one of the world's most mine-affected countries after three decades of war and disorder that ended in 1998, with some 4 million to 6 million mines or unexploded munitions littering the country.",
      "Its efforts to rid the country of mines has been enormous, and Landmine Monitor said Cambodia and Croatia accounted for 75% of all land cleared of mines in 2023, with more than 200 square kilometers (80 square miles).",
      "Prime Minister Hun Manet joined the calls for more nations to join the Mine Ban Treaty, and thanked the international community for supporting Cambodia's mine clearance efforts. He said they have reduced land mine casualties from more than 4,300 in 1996 to fewer than 100 annually over the last decade.",

      "The planet is \u201c choking on plastic, \u201d according to the United Nations. It's polluting lakes, rivers, oceans and people's bodies.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t kick the can, or the plastic bottle, down the road,\" U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said in a message to negotiators.",
      "This \u201cis an issue about the intergenerational justice of those generations that will come after us and be living with all this garbage. We can solve this and we must get it done in Busan,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "The previous four global meetings have revealed sharp differences in goals and interests. This week's talks go through Saturday.",
      "Led by Norway and Rwanda, 66 countries plus the European Union say they want to address the total amount of plastic on Earth by controlling design, production, consumption and where plastic ends up. The delegation from the hard-hit island nation of Micronesia helped lead an effort to call more attention to \"unsustainable\u201d plastic production, called the Bridge to Busan. Island nations are grappling with vast amounts of other countries\u2019 plastic waste washing up on their shores.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s the heart of the treaty, to go upstream and to get to the problem at its source,\u201d said Dennis Clare, legal advisor and plastics negotiator for Micronesia. \u201cThere\u2019s a tagline, \u2018You can\u2019t recycle your way out of this problem.\u2019\u201d",
      "Some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, including Saudi Arabia, disagree. They vigorously oppose any limits on plastic manufacturing. Most plastic is made from fossil fuels. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of primary polypropylene, a common type of plastic, accounting for an estimated 17% of exports last year, according to the Plastics Industry Association.",
      "China, the United States and Germany led the global plastics trade by exports and imports in 2023, the association said.",
      "The plastics industry has been advocating for a treaty focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse, sometimes referred to as \u201ccircularity.\u201d Chris Jahn, International Council of Chemical Associations secretariat, said negotiators should focus on ending plastic waste in the environment, not plastic production, to get a deal. Many countries won\u2019t join a treaty if it includes production caps, he said.",
      "To continue to progress and grow as a global economy, there are going to be more plastics, Jahn added.",
      "\u201cSo we should strive then to keep those plastics in the economy and out of the environment,\u201d Jahn said.",
      "The United States delegation at first said countries should develop their own plans to act, a position viewed as favoring industry. It changed its position this summer, saying the U.S. is open to considering global targets for reductions in plastic production.",
      "Environmental groups accused the U.S. of backtracking as negotiations approached.",
      "Center for Coalfield Justice executive director Sarah Martik said the United States is standing on the sidelines rather than leading, putting \u201ctheir thumb on the scale throughout the entirety of the negotiations.\u201d She hopes this does not derail other countries\u2019 ambition.",
      "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released a national strategy to prevent plastic pollution Thursday, but Martik said she thinks too many of the measures are voluntary to make a difference.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, said it's a mistake for the United States to settle for the lowest common denominator proposals, just to get some kind of agreement.",
      "Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the committee chair from Ecuador, recently proposed text for sections where he thinks the delegations could agree.",
      "The production and use of plastics globally is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, up 70% from 2020, without policy changes, according to the intergovernmental Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.",
      "Research published in Science this month found it is still possible to nearly end plastic pollution. The policies that make the most difference are: mandating new products be made with 40% post-consumer recycled plastic; limiting new plastic production to 2020 levels; investing significantly in plastic waste management, such as landfills and waste collection services and implementing a small fee on plastic packaging.",
      "The treaty is the only way to solve plastic pollution at this scale, said Douglas McCauley, professor at UC Santa Barbara and UC Berkeley. McCauley co-led the research.",
      "Margaret Spring, chief conservation and science officer for Monterey Bay Aquarium, said plastic pollution used to be considered largely a waste problem. Now it is widely viewed as an existential crisis that must be addressed, said Spring, who represents the International Science Council at the negotiations.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen people\u2019s understanding of this issue move as fast, given how complex the topic is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives me hope that we can actually start moving the dial.\u201d",

      "Vice President Sara Duterte said Saturday in an online news conference that she has contracted an assassin to kill the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives if she herself is killed, in a threat she warned was not a joke.",
      "The national police and military immediately boosted the security of the president, and the justice department said it would summon the vice president for an investigation. The National Security Council said it considered the threat a national security concern.",
      "The vice president, a lawyer, later tried to walk back her remarks by saying it was not an actual threat but an expression of concern about her own safety over an unspecified threat.",
      "\u201cWhy would I kill him if not for revenge from the grave? There is no reason for me to kill him. What\u2019s the benefit for me?\u201d Duterte told journalists.",

Lopez has been detained in a hospital after being traumatized by a plan by legislators to temporarily detain her in prison.",

      "Opposition Sen. Ross Cadell asked how his 10-year-old stepson was able to hold Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube accounts from the age of 8, despite the platforms setting a nominal age limit of 13.",
      "Bose replied that \u201cthis is an area where the industry needs to improve.\u201d",

      "Unaligned Sen. Jacqui Lambie asked why the platforms didn\u2019t use their algorithms to prevent harmful material being directed to children. The algorithms have been accused of keeping technology-addicted children connected to platforms and of flooding users with harmful material that promotes suicide and eating disorders.",
      "\u201cYour platforms have the ability to do that. The only thing that\u2019s stopping them is themselves and their greed,\u201d Lambie said.",
      "Bose said algorithms were already in place to protect young people online through functions including filtering out nudity.",

      "The statement from the country's Interior Ministry offered no motive for the slaying of Zvi Kogan, though an Israeli Foreign Ministry official later told The Associated Press that he simply had been \u201ckilled because of who he was.\"",
      "Kogan, 28, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi who went missing on Thursday, ran a kosher grocery store in the city of Dubai, where Israelis have flocked for commerce and tourism since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in the 2020 Abraham Accords.",

      "The Interior Ministry statement identified the three men as Olimboy Tohirovich, 28, Makhmudjon Abdurakhim, 28, and Azizbek Kamilovich, 33. The state-run WAM news agency carried images of the three men, blindfolds covering their faces in prison uniforms and flip flops.",

      "It wasn't immediately clear if the three men had lawyers or had sought consular assistance in the UAE, an autocratically ruled nation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. The Uzbek Consulate in Dubai did not respond to a request for comment regarding the arrests.",

      "The official acknowledged that tensions likely boil beneath the surface in the UAE, but praised the Emirati government for their investigation into Kogan's killing. Israeli security services have been involved in the probe, the official said. That likely includes the Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence service.",

Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. The resolution calls for the Lebanese army to deploy in southern Lebanon bordering Israel, territory still controlled by Hezbollah.",
      "Dujarric said Lebanese authorities report that an average of 250 people have been killed every week in November, bringing the death toll to more than 3,700 since October 2023.",
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 An Israeli strike has wounded the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, one of the few hospitals still partially operating in the northernmost part of Gaza, local and international health officials said.",
      "Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya was in his office when it was hit by an Israeli quadcopter drone on Sunday, according to the humanitarian organization MedGlobal.",
      "The doctor was wounded by shrapnel in his thigh and back, causing serious bleeding that requires surgical care, the aid group said. Abu Safiya is the lead physician in Gaza for MedGlobal, which has worked in Gaza since 2018.",
      "Dr. Munir al-Boursh, director general of Gaza's Health Ministry, posted a video to social media on Monday showing Abu Safiya limping and leaning on a crutch while speaking to patients inside the hospital.",
      "The Israeli military said it was unaware of a strike on the grounds of Kamal Adwan Hospital and said it does its utmost to avoid harming civilians.",
      "During the past month, Kamal Adwan Hospital has been hit several times, was put under siege and was raided by Israeli troops, who are waging a heavy offensive in the nearby Jabaliya refugee camp and towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya. The Israeli military says it detained Hamas fighters hiding in the hospital, a claim its staff denies.",
      "Abu Safiya said Israeli strikes on the hospital last week wounded nine medical staff and damaged the generator and oxygen systems. He said the hospital was treating 85 wounded, 14 children in the pediatric ward and four newborns in the neonatal unit. Israel also denied knowledge of conducting any strikes on in the area of the hospital at that time.",
      "BEIRUT \u2014 A top Hamas official in Lebanon said the Palestinian militant group will support a ceasefire between its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and Israel, despite Hezbollah's previous promises to stop the fighting in Lebanon only if the war in Gaza ends.",
      "\u201cAny announcement of a ceasefire is welcome. Hezbollah has stood by our people and made significant sacrifices,\u201d Osama Hamdan told the Lebanese broadcaster Al-Mayadeen, which is seen as politically allied with Hezbollah.",
      "There has been no official comment on a potential Lebanon ceasefire from Gaza-based leaders of either Hamas or the smaller militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Hamdan is a member of Hamas' political wing. Palestinian militants in Gaza have repeatedly regrouped after Israeli operations, carrying out hit-and-run attacks from tunnels and bombed-out buildings.",
      "Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire across the border since Oct. 8, 2023, the day after Hamas attacked Israel and sparked the war in Gaza. Israel escalated the war in September, killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders in a wave of airstrikes, and Israeli ground forces invaded southern Lebanon in early October.",
      "JERUSALEM -- Israel has tightened restrictions on public gatherings and outdoor activities in areas near the Lebanese border as officials move closer toward a ceasefire deal.",
      "The army\u2019s Home Front Command said it was changing its public safety guidelines to \u201climited activity\u201d from \u201cpartial activity.\u201d As part of the order, school was canceled in the area.",
      "The Israeli security Cabinet is scheduled to convene Tuesday to discuss a cease-fire proposal and possibly approve it.",
      "The tighter restrictions reflect concerns that fighting could intensify ahead of any possible cease-fire.",
      "The Israeli army says at least 20 projectiles were fired by Hezbollah toward Israel Monday, a day after the Lebanese group launched over 250 rockets and missiles. The Israeli air force conducted strikes against suspected Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon.",
      "Israel\u2019s military launched airstrikes across Lebanon on Monday, unleashing explosions throughout the country and killing at least 12 while Israeli leaders appeared to be closing in on a negotiated ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group.",
      "BEIRUT \u2014 Israel\u2019s military bombed commercial and residential buildings in the Lebanese capital of Beirut and killed at least 12 people in the southern port city of Tyre on Monday, the Health Ministry said, as Israeli leaders appeared to be closing in on a negotiated ceasefire with the Hezbollah militant group.",
      "Israeli military officials said they targeted areas known as Hezbollah strongholds. They issued evacuation orders for Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, and strikes landed across the city, including meters from a Lebanese police base and the city\u2019s largest public park. The blasts damaged buildings and left shattered glass and debris scattered across nearby streets. No casualties were reported after many residents fled the targeted sites.",
      "Some of the strikes landed close to central Beirut and near Christian neighborhoods and other targets where Israel had issued evacuation warnings, including in Tyre and Nabatiyeh province. Israeli airstrikes also hit the northeast Baalbek-Hermel region without warning.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry said more than 3,700 people in Lebanon who have been killed since Israel launched its invasion two months ago. Israel says it has killed more than 2,000 Hezbollah members. Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry says the war has displaced 1.2 million people.",
      "Lebanese politicians have decried the ongoing airstrikes and said they are impeding U.S.-led ceasefire negotiations. The country\u2019s deputy parliament speaker accused Israel of ramping up its bombardment in order to pressure Lebanon to make concessions in indirect ceasefire negotiations with Hezbollah.",
      "Elias Bousaab, an ally of the militant group, said Monday that the pressure has increased because \u201cwe are close to the hour that is decisive regarding reaching a ceasefire.\u201d",
      "BEIRUT \u2014 An Israeli airstrike that killed three journalists and wounded others in Lebanon last month was most likely a deliberate attack on civilians and an apparent war crime, an international human rights group said Monday.",
      "The Oct. 25 airstrike killed three journalists as they slept at a guesthouse in southeast Lebanon in one of the deadliest attacks on the media since the Israel-Hezbollah war began 13 months ago.",
      "Eleven other journalists have been killed and eight wounded since then, Lebanon\u2019s Health Minister Firass Abiad said.",
      "Human Rights Watch determined that Israeli forces carried out the Oct. 25 attack using an air-dropped bomb equipped with a U.S.-produced Joint Direct Attack Munition, or JDAM, guidance kit.",
      "The group said the U.S. government should suspend weapons transfers to Israel because of the military\u2019s repeated \u201cunlawful attacks on civilians, for which U.S. officials may be complicit in war crimes.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the report.",
      "Human Rights Watch said that it found remnants at the site and reviewed photographs of pieces collected by the resort owner and determined that they were consistent with a JDAM guidance kit assembled and sold by the U.S. company Boeing.",
      "The JDAM is affixed to air-dropped bombs and allows them to be guided to a target by using satellite coordinates, making the weapon accurate to within several meters, the group said.",
      "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 Israel\u2019s U.N. ambassador says he expects a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah to have stages, and \u201cit\u2019s not going to happen overnight.\u201d",
      "Danny Danon told reporters Monday \u201cwe haven\u2019t finalized it but we are moving forward.\u201d He added, \u201cI assume that the Cabinet will meet today or tomorrow to discuss it.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s important for Israel, he said, is that Hezbollah militants will be pushed to the north of the Litani River and will not be allowed to come back.",
      "Danon was asked about reports that Israel wants the right to go back into Lebanon to attack Hezbollah if it returns to the south but the Lebanese government rejected that out of hand.",
      "He stressed that Israel learned the lessons from U.N. Security Council resolution 1701 which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. It called for the deployment of the Lebanese army throughout the south and disarmament of all armed groups including Hezbollah but was never implemented.",
      "\u201cWe will make sure that we will have the ability to neutralize any threat that will not be dealt in southern Lebanon,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that the Lebanese army will take care of that in the future, but if they will fail again, we will be there.\u201d",
      "In the ceasefire proposal, Danon said, \u201cthere are different stages, few requirements.\u201d",
      "He said the U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon known as UNIFIL is not part of the agreement as far as he knows, but he called its presence there \u201cimportant, and we are grateful for that.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey know about what\u2019s happening, and I think they have also to take advantage of the situation and make sure that the uniform presence is more effective,\u201d the Israeli ambassador said.",
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 A senior Israeli officer has resigned following the deaths of two people, including a 70-year-old Israeli man, in a Hezbollah ambush last week in southern Lebanon.",
      "The Israeli military has launched an investigation into last Wednesday\u2019s incident, in which 70-year-old Zeev Erlich was killed along with a 20-year-old soldier.",
      "They are trying to determine, among other things, who allowed Erlich into the combat zone with the forces and why he was allowed to enter.",
      "In a letter obtained by The Associated Press, Col. Yoav Yarom, the chief of staff of the army\u2019s Golani infantry brigade, said he was stepping down.",
      "Yarom, who was wounded in the incident, said a \u201cfalse and far from the truth narrative\u201d has emerged.",
      "Nonetheless, he said \u201cin light of the values upon which I was raised ... I believe I must take a commander\u2019s responsibility for the event.\u201d He did not specify his role.",
      "According to Israeli media reports, Erlich was not on active duty when he was shot, but was wearing a military uniform and had a weapon. The army said he was a reservist with the rank of major and identified him as a \u201cfallen soldier\u201d when it announced his death.",
      "Erlich was a well-known West Bank settler and researcher of Jewish history. Media reports said he was permitted to enter Lebanon to explore a local archaeological site.",
      "The military said the investigation is continuing.",
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli officials say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s security Cabinet is set to convene on Tuesday to discuss a proposed ceasefire in the war with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon.",
      "Officials have said the sides are close to a deal that would include withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon and a pullback of Hezbollah forces from the Israeli border. But several sticking points remain.",
      "Two officials confirmed the Cabinet meeting is set for Tuesday, but they said it is still not clear whether the decision-making body will vote to approve the deal.",
      "The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing internal deliberations.",
      "\u2014 Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 Weather is compounding the challenges facing displaced people in Gaza, where heavy rains and dropping temperatures are making tents and other temporary shelters uninhabitable.",
      "Government officials in the Hamas-controlled coastal enclave said on Monday that nearly 10,000 tents had been swept away by flooding over the past two days, adding to their earlier warnings about the risks facing those sheltering in low-lying floodplains, including areas designated as humanitarian zones.",
      "Um Mohammad Marouf, a mother who fled bombardments in northern Gaza and now is sheltering with her family in a Gaza City tent said the downpour had covered her children and left everyone wet and vulnerable.",
      "\u201cWe have nothing to protect ourselves,\u201d she said outside the United Nations-provided tent where she lives with 10 family members.",
      "Marouf and others living in rows of cloth and nylon tents hung their drenched clothing on drying lines and re-erected their tarpaulin walls on Monday.",
      "Officials from the Hamas-run government said that 81% of the 135,000 tents appeared unfit for shelter, based on recent assessments, and blamed Israel for preventing the entry of additional needed tents. They said many had been swept away by seawater or were inadequate to house displaced people as winter sets in.",
      "The U.N estimates that around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are living in squalid tent camps with little food, water or basic services. Israeli evacuation warnings now cover around 90% of the territory.",
      "\u201cThe first rains of the winter season mean even more suffering. Around half a million people are at risk in areas of flooding. The situation will only get worse with every drop of rain, every bomb, every strike,\u201d UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, wrote in a statement on X on Monday.",
      "ROME \u2014 Several Arab foreign ministers, gathering in Rome on the sidelines of the Group of Seven meeting, are calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon and the provision of humanitarian aid to Palestinians.",

      "The Mideast conflict was the top agenda item Monday for the G7, amid reported progress on a possible ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. said a deal could be reached within days.",
      "\u201cWe all hope and pray that this ceasefire will be realized because the absence of it will mean more destruction, and more and more animosity, and more dehumanization, and more hatred, and more bitterness which will doom the future of the region to more conflict and more killing and more destruction,\u201d Safadi said.",
      "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty reaffirmed that Cairo would host a ministerial-level conference next Monday on mobilizing international aid for Gaza. In remarks to the \u201cMediterranean Dialogues\u201d conference, he called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, the release of hostages, provision of humanitarian aid for Palestinians and the initiation of \u201ca serious and genuine political process\u201d to create a Palestinian state.",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 An Israeli rights group said Monday that more than a quarter of all Palestinian prisoners currently held by Israel had contracted scabies since an outbreak was identified in May, and accused the prison authority of improper care and prevention.",
      "Physicians for Human Rights-Israel said that more than 2,800 prisoners had caught the rash-like infection, with more than 1,700 still actively infected. The outbreak was seen in five different detention facilities, the group said. It was citing figures it said came from the Israel Prison Service.",
      "The group said it filed a legal petition calling on the prison service \u201c to eradicate the scabies epidemic,\u201d accusing the authorities of failing \u201cto implement widely recognized medical interventions necessary to contain the outbreak.\u201d",
      "It said that it halted the legal proceedings after it received a commitment from the prison service to address the outbreak. The prison service said the court had cancelled the petition because the prisons had shown they were dealing with the outbreak in a \u201csystematic and thorough\u201d way.",
      "Nadav Davidovich, an Israeli public health expert who wrote a medical analysis for the group\u2019s court proceedings, said the outbreak was a result of overcrowding in prisons and apparent neglect from prison authorities. He said such outbreaks could be prevented if prisoners were held \u201cin more reasonable conditions.\u201d If the first infections were treated as needed, such an outbreak could have been avoided, he said.",
      "Physicians for Human Rights-Israel also said that the Israel Prison Service had cited scabies as a reason for postponing lawyers' visits and court appearances for prisoners. It said those steps \u201cviolate prisoners\u2019 rights and serve as punitive measures rather than public health responses.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the prisons, has boasted about hardening conditions to the bare minimum required by law.",
      "BEIRUT \u2014 Lebanon\u2019s deputy parliament speaker has accused Israel of ramping up its bombardment of Lebanon in order to pressure the government to make concessions in indirect ceasefire negotiations with Hezbollah.",

      "\u201cWe are optimistic, and there is hope, but nothing is guaranteed with a person like (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu),\u201d Bousaab told reporters.",
      "Israel has carried out heavy strikes in central Beirut in recent days, while Hezbollah has increased its rocket fire into Israel.",
      "The United States is trying to broker an agreement in which Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces would withdraw from southern Lebanon and Lebanese troops would patrol the region, along with a U.N. peacekeeping force.",
      "Israel has demanded freedom of action to strike Hezbollah if it violates the ceasefire, but Bousaab said that was not part of the emerging agreement.",
      "He also said Israel had accepted that France be part of the committee overseeing the ceasefire after Lebanese officials insisted. There was no immediate confirmation from the Israeli side.",
      "Israel has objected to France being on the committee in the wake of the International Criminal Court\u2019s decision last week to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu, his former defense minister and a Hamas military commander.",
      "France said it supports the court. It said the question of whether it would arrest Netanyahu if he set foot on French soil was a \u201ccomplex legal issue\u201d that would have to be worked out.",
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 The Palestinian Health Ministry says Israeli forces killed two people, including a 13-year-old, in the occupied West Bank.",
      "The Israeli military said the two had thrown explosives at forces overnight near the Palestinian town of Yabad and that the forces had responded by opening fire.",
      "The Health Ministry identified the two as Mohammed Hamarsheh, 13, and Ahmad Zayd, 20. It did not disclose details about the circumstances behind their deaths.",
      "It was the latest bloodshed in the West Bank, which has faced a surge of violence throughout the 13-month war in Gaza. The Health Ministry says nearly 800 people have been killed, with more than 160 of them 18 and younger.",
      "Many have been killed in fighting with the Israeli military, but Palestinians throwing rocks and others not involved in confrontations have also been killed. There has also been an increase in Palestinian attacks against Israelis in the West Bank since the war in Gaza began.",
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 The Israeli government has ordered all public entities to stop advertising in the Haaretz newspaper, which is known for its critical coverage of Israel\u2019s actions in the Palestinian territories.",
      "Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said Sunday that the government had approved his proposal after Haaretz\u2019 publisher called for sanctions against Israel and referred to Palestinian militants as \u201cfreedom fighters.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe advocate for a free press and freedom of expression, but also the freedom of the government to decide not to fund incitement against the State of Israel,\u201d Karhi wrote on the social platform X.",
      "Noa Landau, the deputy editor of Haaretz, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of \u201cworking to silence independent and critical media,\u201d comparing him to autocratic leaders in other countries.",
      "Haaretz regularly publishes investigative journalism and opinion columns critical of Israel\u2019s ongoing half-century occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state.",
      "It has also been critical of Israel\u2019s war conduct in Gaza at a time when most local media support the war and largely ignore the suffering of Palestinian civilians.",
      "In a speech in London last month, Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken said Israel has imposed \u201ca cruel apartheid regime\u201d on the Palestinians and was battling \u201cPalestinian freedom fighters that Israel calls \u2018terrorists.\u2019\u201d",
      "He later issued a statement, saying he had reconsidered his remarks.",

      "Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made the remarks Monday during an event in which he spoke to members of the Basij, the all-volunteer arm of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.",

      "BEIRUT -- Diplomats and other officials say there have been several sticking points in ceasefire talks to end the war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, even as conditions for an agreement appear to be ripe.",
      "Israel\u2019s military has killed nearly all of the militant group\u2019s top leaders, but it continues to fire missiles into Israel. Tens of thousands of Israelis who were evacuated from the border months ago are pressuring their government to help them go home. And the world wants to stop regional conflict from spreading after more than a year of fighting.",
      "Following the latest visit to the region by a U.S. mediator, Israel hit central Beirut over the weekend, and Hezbollah responded with its biggest barrage in weeks as each applied pressure to reach a deal.",
      "Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire almost daily since the day after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, setting off the war in Gaza.",
      "Israel launched a widespread bombardment of Lebanon two months ago, then a ground invasion. More than 3,500 people in Lebanon have been killed, many of them civilians.",
      "More than 70 have been killed in Israel, over 40 of them civilians. In addition, over 50 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the proposal and the sticking points.",
      "The proposal under discussion to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah calls for an initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River.",
      "The withdrawals would be accompanied by an influx of thousands more Lebanese army troops, who have been largely sidelined in the war, to patrol the border area along with an existing U.N. peacekeeping force.",
      "An international committee would be set up to monitor implementation of the ceasefire agreement and of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which was passed in 2006 to end a monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah but never fully implemented. Hezbollah never ended its presence in southern Lebanon, while Lebanon said Israel regularly violated its airspace and occupied small patches of its territory.",
      "It is not clear whether a new deal would be any more successfully implemented than the one in 2006.",
      "Michael Herzog, Israel\u2019s ambassador to Washington, told Israeli Army Radio on Monday that the deal aimed to improve surveillance and enforcement of the previous resolution. While he said there were still certain points that needed to be finalized, a deal was close and could be clinched \u201cwithin days.\u201d",
      "A U.S. official said negotiations continued to progress on Sunday, but the parties still need to work out some outstanding issues to close the deal. The official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the private talks, declined to detail the outstanding issues.",
      "Two Western diplomats described several points of dispute to The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing negotiations.",
      "They said Israel was asking for more guarantees to ensure that Hezbollah\u2019s weapons are removed from the border area. Israeli officials, concerned about the possibility of Hezbollah launching the kind of attack that Hamas carried out from Gaza into southern Israel, have said they would not agree to a ceasefire deal that doesn't explicitly grant them freedom to strike in Lebanon if they believe Hezbollah is violating it.",
      "An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the sensitive talks, said the issue remained a point of contention, although he said the talks were headed in a \u201cpositive direction.\u201d",
      "Lebanese officials have said agreeing to such a deal would violate Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem has said the militant group would not agree to a deal that does not entail a \u201ccomplete and comprehensive end to the aggression\u201d and does not protect Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "Lebanon and Israel have also disagreed over which countries would sit on the international committee overseeing implementation of the deal and Resolution 1701.",
      "In a sign of progress, Israel appeared to have dropped its opposition to France, which has remained close with Lebanon since its colonial rule there ended and has recently been at odds with Israel.",
      "On Monday, an official familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing behind-the-scenes negotiations, said that France would be part of the monitoring committee. Lebanon\u2019s deputy parliament speaker, Elias Bousaab, also said Israel had accepted France.",
      "But Lebanon has refused to allow Britain, a close ally of Israel. It was unclear Monday if Lebanese officials had dropped their opposition following Israel\u2019s concession.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel does not want to enter into negotiations on 13 disputed points along the border as part of a ceasefire deal, the diplomats said.",
      "A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the strongest of Iran's armed proxies, is expected to significantly calm regional tensions that have led to fears of war between Israel and Iran directly. It's not clear how it would affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Hezbollah had long insisted that it would not agree to a ceasefire until the war in Gaza ends, but it has now dropped that condition.",
      "One diplomat said there are fears that if no ceasefire is reached, the war will expand further into Syria and Iraq as Israel attempts to cut off the supply of weapons from Iran to Hezbollah. Israel has carried out regular airstrikes on Iran-linked groups in Syria and has threatened to strike in Iraq, where Iran-backed militias have periodically launched drone attacks on Israel.",
      "Geir Pedersen, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said during a visit to Damascus on Sunday that ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon are critical to \u201cavoid Syria being dragged even further into the conflict.\u201d",
      "Analysts say Hezbollah has been weakened but continues to keep up steady fire into Israel, including strikes far from the border.",
      "On Sunday, Hezbollah fired about 250 rockets and other projectiles into Israel, wounding seven people in one of the militant group\u2019s heaviest barrages in months, in response to deadly Israeli strikes in Beirut. Violent clashes continue in southern Lebanon as Israeli forces attempt to take control of strategic towns.",
      "Israel says its goal in the war with Hezbollah is to enable displaced Israelis to safely return home. In Lebanon, a quarter of the population has been displaced, and parts of the country, particularly in south Lebanon and areas south of the capital Beirut, have been destroyed.",
      "In Lebanon, where officials and residents are anxious for war to end, an initial rush of optimism dissipated after the Biden administration\u2019s point man on Israel and Lebanon, Amos Hochstein, left the region last week without a deal.",
      "Many now believe no agreement will be reached before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January.",

      "Iraq\u2019s prime minister says the country's population has grown to 45.4 million, according to preliminary results from a national census, the first in nearly 40 years",
      "BAGHDAD -- Preliminary results from an Iraqi national census, the first in nearly 40 years, show that the population has grown to 45.4 million, the prime minister said on Monday.",
      "The nationwide population census, carried out earlier this month, is a step aimed at modernizing data collection and planning in a country long impacted by conflict and political divisions.",
      "Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said on Monday that initial results showed the country\u2019s population has reached approximately 45.4 million people. In 2009, an unofficial count estimated the population at 31.6 million.",
      "The gender distribution according to Monday's initial results shows a nearly even split, with males making up 50.1% of the population and females 49.8% of the population.",
      "The act of counting the population, the first in 37 years, is contentious in Iraq, with profound implications for the country\u2019s resource distribution, budget allocations and development planning. Minority groups also fear that a documented decline in their numbers will bring decreased political influence and fewer economic benefits in the country\u2019s sectarian power-sharing system.",
      "By order of Iraq\u2019s federal court, the census excluded questions about ethnicity and sectarian affiliation, focusing solely on broad religious categories such as Muslim and Christian.",
      "The last nationwide census in Iraq was held in 1987. Another one held in 1997 excluded the Kurdish region.",
      "The next phase of the census will run over the coming weeks before final results, which will include information on religious groups, are announced, according to Ali Arian Saleh, the executive director of the census at the Ministry of Planning.",
      "The census was the first to employ advanced technologies for gathering and analyzing data, providing a comprehensive picture of Iraq\u2019s demographic, social, and economic landscape, officials said. Some 120,000 census workers surveyed households across the country, covering approximately 160 housing units each over two days.",

In July, 10 members of a Cambodian environmental group, Mother Nature Cambodia, who campaigned against destructive infrastructure projects and alleged corruption, were each sentenced to six years in prison on charges of conspiring against the state.",
      "Local rights group Licadho said that the government granted an economic land concession in the area in 2022, even though it contravened a 2012 moratorium on new concessions, which have been linked to mass evictions, rapid deforestation and extraction of resources.",
      "Cambodia\u2019s government has long been accused of using its judiciary to persecute critics and political opponents. Prime Minister Hun Manet succeeded his father, Hun Sen, in August last year after he ruled the country for nearly four decades, but there have been few signs of political liberalization."

      "Authorities have closed schools and suspended internet services in a northern Indian city a day after four people were killed in clashes sparked by an official survey probing whether a 16th-century mosque was built on a Hindu temple",
      "LUCKNOW, India -- Authorities closed schools and suspended internet services in a northern Indian city on Monday, officials said, a day after four people were killed in clashes sparked by an official survey probing whether a 16th-century mosque was built on a Hindu temple.",
      "Nearly 1,000 Muslim protesters gathered outside the Shahi Jama Masjid in Sambhal, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, on Sunday to prevent a team conducting a court-ordered survey after a petition from a Hindu lawyer that claimed the mosque was built on the site of a Hindu temple, officials said.",
      "\u201cAll schools and colleges have been closed and public gatherings have been prohibited\u201d in Sambhal, said a local administrator, Aunjaneya Kumar Singh. Authorities also banned outsiders, social organizations and public representatives from entering the city without official permission until Nov. 30, Singh said, as the government scrambled to contain the unrest.",
      "What began as a standoff escalated into clashes when protesters threw stones at police, who responded by deploying tear gas, police said.",
      "\u201cSome miscreants in the crowd resorted to violence, forcing us to use minor force and tear gas to restore order,\u201d said Krishna Kumar Vishnoi, a local police officer.",
      "Videos circulating on social media showed scenes of stone-pelting and vehicles engulfed in flames as police used firearms.",
      "Despite the unrest, the survey proceeded as planned.",
      "As authorities brace for potential fallout, the incident has reignited tensions over religious disputes in India where historical grievances often fuel contemporary conflicts.",
      "Hindu activist groups, mostly linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling party, have claimed that several mosques in India were built over Hindu temples centuries ago during the Muslim Mughal empire.",
      "Experts say Hindu nationalists have been emboldened after Modi earlier this year inaugurated a controversial Hindu temple built on the ruins of a centuries-old mosque in the northern city of Ayodhya, in a political triumph for the populist leader who is seeking to transform the country from a secular democracy into a Hindu state.",
      "The petitioner in Sambhal cites historical texts that the mosque was constructed over a Hindu temple allegedly destroyed by Mughal emperor Babur in 1529. The proponents of the survey argue it seeks to uncover historical truths while opponents condemn it as a violation of the Places of Worship Act, 1991, which maintains the religious status quo of sites as they were in 1947.",

      "A surveillance video showed the plane descending normally as it approached the airport before sunrise, and then exploding into a huge ball of fire behind a building. The moment of impact could not be seen in the video.",
      "Lithuanian officials acknowledged that one line of inquiry will be whether Russia played a role given its suspected involvement in other cases of sabotage \u2014 although they stressed that there is no evidence pointing to that at this stage.",
      "\u201cWithout a doubt, we cannot rule out the terrorism version,\u201d said Darius Jauni\u0161kis, chief of Lithuanian intelligence.",
      "Western security officials suspect that Russian intelligence is carrying out sabotage against their nations in retaliation for their support for Ukraine \u2014 including arson attacks, disinformation and by putting incendiary devices in packages on cargo planes. In July one caught fire at a courier hub in Germany and another ignited in a warehouse in England.",
      "Polish prosecutors said last month that parcels with camouflaged explosives were sent via cargo companies to EU countries and Britain to \u201ctest the transfer channel for such parcels\u201d that were ultimately destined for the U.S. and Canada.",

      "The Lithuanian airport authority identified the aircraft as a DHL cargo plane arriving from Leipzig, Germany, a major freight hub, and one of the injured was a German citizen.",
      "The German transportation ministry said that experts from the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation would be sent to Lithuania to help with the investigation.",

      "\u201cWe and our Lithuanian partners must now seriously ask ourselves whether this was an accident or, after last week, another hybrid incident. That shows what volatile times we are living in in the middle of Europe,\u201d Baerbock said.",
      "She was apparently referring to damage to two data cables under the Baltic Sea, one of which ends in Germany, which German officials believe was caused by sabotage.",
      "The head of Lithuania's firefighting service said that the plane skidded a few hundred meters (yards), and photos showed smoke rising from a damaged structure in an area of barren trees.",
      "\u201cThankfully, despite the crash occurring in a residential area, no lives have been lost among the local population,\u201d Prime Minister Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117 said after meeting with rescue officials.",
      "Rescue workers sealed off the area, and fragments of the plane in DHL\u2019s trademark yellow could be seen amid wreckage scattered across the crash site.",

One person, a Spanish citizen, was declared dead and the other three crew members \u2014 who were Spanish, German and Lithuanian citizens \u2014 were injured, said Ram\u016bnas Matonis, the head of communications for Lithuanian police, in an email.",
      "The DHL aircraft was operated by Swiftair, a Madrid-based contractor. DHL said in an emailed comment that the plane \u201cmade a forced landing\u201d about a kilometer (half a miles) from the Vilnius airport, adding: \u201cThe cause of the accident is still unknown and an investigation is already underway.\u201d Swiftair did not comment.",

      "\u201cI saw a fireball,\u201d she said. \u201cMy first thought is that a world (war) has begun and it\u2019s time to grab the documents and run somewhere to a shelter, to a basement.\u201d",
      "Laurynas Kas\u010di\u016bnas, the Lithuanian defense minister, said \u201cthere were definitely no external factors that could have damaged the plane.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can clearly see that,\u201d Kas\u010di\u016bnas said. \"However, to find out what happened inside the plane, it will be necessary to interview the surviving crew members. And of course, the black box. That will take some time.\u201d",
      "Flight-tracking data from FlightRadar24, analyzed by the AP, showed the aircraft made a turn to the north of the airport, lining up for landing, before crashing a little more than 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) short of the runway.",
      "Weather at the airport was around freezing at the time of the crash, with clouds before sunrise and winds around 30 kph (18 mph).",
      "The Boeing 737 was 31 years old, which is considered by experts to be an older airframe, though that\u2019s not unusual for cargo flights.",
      "The prime minister cautioned against speculation, saying investigators needed time to do their job.",
      "\u201cThe responsible agencies are working diligently,\u201d \u0160imonyt\u0117 said. \u201cI urge everyone to have confidence in the investigating authorities\u2019 ability to conduct a thorough and professional investigation within an optimal timeframe.

Many are escaping war or poverty and many employ smugglers to help them negotiate treacherous deserts and sea routes. Roughly 38,000 people have arrived in Italy and Malta from Libya this year, according to UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:25:07 -0500",
    "summary": "He offered new details about who will be handing out the rest of his fortune.",
    "story": [
      "He offered new details about who will be handing out the rest of his fortune.",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Investor Warren Buffett renewed his Thanksgiving tradition of giving by handing out more than $1.1 billion of Berkshire Hathaway stock to four of his family's foundations Monday, and he offered new details about who will be handing out the rest of his fortune after his death.",
      "Buffett has said previously that his three kids will distribute his remaining $147.4 billion fortune in the 10 years after his death, but now he has also designated successors for them because it's possible that Buffett's children could die before giving it all away. He didn't identify the successors, but said his kids all know them and agree they would be good choices.",
      "\u201cFather time always wins. But he can be fickle \u2013 indeed unfair and even cruel \u2013 sometimes ending life at birth or soon thereafter while, at other times, waiting a century or so before paying a visit,\u201d the 94-year-old Buffett said in a letter to his fellow shareholders Monday. \u201cTo date, I\u2019ve been very lucky, but, before long, he will get around to me. There is, however, a downside to my good fortune in avoiding his notice. The expected life span of my children has materially diminished since the 2006 pledge. They are now 71, 69 and 66.\u201d",
      "Buffett said he still has no interest in creating dynastic wealth in his family \u2014 a view shared by his first and current wives. He acknowledged giving Howard, Peter and Susie millions over the years, but he has long said he believes \u201chugely wealthy parents should leave their children enough so they can do anything but not enough that they can do nothing.\u201d",
      "The secret to building up such massive wealth over time has been the power of compounding interest and the steady growth of the Berkshire conglomerate Buffett leads through acquisitions and smart investments like buying billions of dollars of Apple shares as iPhone sales continued to drive growth in that company. Buffett never sold any of his Berkshire stock over the years and also resisted the trappings of wealth and never indulged in much \u2014 preferring instead to continue living in the same Omaha home he'd bought decades earlier and drive sensible luxury sedans about 20 blocks to work each day.",
      "\u201cAs a family, we have had everything we needed or simply liked, but we have not sought enjoyment from the fact that others craved what we had,\u201d he said.",
      "If Buffett and his first wife had never given away any of their Berkshire shares, the family's fortune would be worth nearly $364 billion \u2014 easily making him the world's richest man \u2014 but Buffett said he had no regrets about his giving over the years. The family's giving began in earnest with the distribution of Susan Buffett's $3 billion estate after her death in 2004, but really took off when Warren Buffett announced plans in 2006 to make annual gifts to the foundations run by his kids along with the one he and his wife started, as well as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",
      "Warren Buffett's giving to date has favored the Gates Foundation with $55 billion in stock because his friend Bill Gates already had his foundation set up and could handle huge gifts when Buffett started giving away his fortune. But Buffett has said his kids now have enough experience in philanthropy to handle the task and he plans to cut off his Gates Foundation donations after his death. Buffett always makes his main annual gifts to all five foundations every summer, but for several years now he has been giving additional Berkshire shares to his family's foundations at Thanksgiving.",
      "Buffett reiterated Monday his advice to every parent to allow their families to read their will while they are still alive \u2014 like he has done \u2014 to make sure they have a chance to explain their decisions about how to distribute their belongings and answer their children's questions. Buffett said he and his longtime investing partner Charlie Munger, who died a year ago, \u201csaw many families driven apart after the posthumous dictates of the will left beneficiaries confused and sometimes angry.\u201d",
      "Today, Buffett continues to lead Berkshire Hathaway as chairman and CEO and has no plans to retire although he has handed over most of the day-to-day managing duties for the conglomerates dozens of companies to others. That allows him to focus on his favorite activity of deciding where to invest Berkshire's billions. One of Buffett's deputies who oversees all the noninsurance companies now, Greg Abel, is set to take over as CEO after Buffett's death.",
      "Even after converting 1,600 Class A shares into 2.4 million Class B Berkshire shares and giving them away, Buffett still owns 206,363 Class A shares and controls more than 30% of the vote.",

      "NEW YORK -- More shoppers than ever are on track to use \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 plans this holiday season, as the ability to spread out payments looks attractive at a time when Americans still feel the lingering effect of inflation and already have record-high credit card debt.",
      "The data firm Adobe Analytics predicts shoppers will spend 11.4% more this holiday season using buy now, pay later than they did a year ago. The company forecasts shoppers will purchase $18.5 billion worth of goods using the third-party services for the period Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, with $993 million worth of purchases on Cyber Monday alone.",
      "Buy now, pay later can be particularly appealing to consumers who have low credit scores or no credit history, such as younger shoppers, because most of the companies providing the service run only soft credit checks and don\u2019t report the loans and payment histories to the credit bureaus, unlike credit card companies.",
      "This holiday season, buy now, pay later users can also feel more confident if a transaction goes awry. In May, the CFPB said buy now, pay later company must adhere to other regulations that govern traditional credit, such as providing ways to demand refunds and dispute transactions.",
      "To use a buy now, pay later plan, consumers typically sign up with bank account information or a debit or credit card, and agree to pay for purchases in monthly installments, typically over eight weeks or more. The loans are marketed as requiring no or low interest, or only conditional fees, such as for late payment. Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm are three of the biggest buy now, pay later companies.",
      "But consumer advocates warn that shoppers who sign up for the payment plans using a credit card can be hit with more interest and fees. That's because individuals open themselves up to interest on the credit card payment, if it's carried month to month, on top of any late fees, interest, or penalties from the buy now, pay later loan itself. Experts advise against using a credit card to pay for these plans for this reason.",
      "Consumer watchdogs also say the plans lead consumers to overextend themselves because, for example, not paying full price up front leaves, in the shopper\u2019s mind at least, more money for smaller purchases. They also caution consumers to keep careful track of using multiple buy now, pay later services, as the automatic payments can add up, and there is no central reporting, such as with a credit card statement.",
      "\u201cBuy now, pay later can be an innovative tool for purchases you\u2019re going to make anyway,\u201d said Mark Elliott, chief customer officer at financial services company LendingClub. \u201cThe challenge is that it does fuel overspending.\u201d",
      "For merchants, that\u2019s part of the appeal. Retailers have found that customers are more likely to have bigger cart sizes or to convert from browsing to checking out when buy now, pay later is offered. One report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York cited research that found customers spend 20% more when buy now, pay later is available.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that the increased cost-of-living and inflation have put more people in a situation where they\u2019re already relying on revolving credit,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThe psychographics of \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 may be different \u2014 people don\u2019t think of it as debt \u2014 but it is.\u201d",

      "She's not sure what to think about Jaguar now after the 89-year-old company announced a radical rebranding this week that featured loud colors and androgynous people \u2014 but no cars. Jaguar, the company says, will now be JaGUar. It will produce only electric vehicles beginning in 2026.",
      "And say goodbye to British racing green, Cotswold Blue and black. Its colors are henceforth electric pink, red and yellow, according to a video that has received backlash online. Its mission statement: \u201cCreate exuberance. Live vivid. Delete ordinary. Break moulds.\u201d",
      "\u201cIntrigued?\u201d @Jaguar posted on social media. \"Weird and unsettled\u201d is more like it, Vogt wrote on Instagram.",
      "\u201cEspecially now, with the world feeling so dystopian,\" the Cyprus-based brand designer wrote, \"a heritage brand like Jaguar should be conveying feelings of safety, stability, and maybe a hint of rebellion \u2014 the kind that shakes things up in a good way, not in a way that unsettles.\u201d",
      "Jaguar, a sturdy symbol of British tradition and refinement, was one of several iconic companies that announced significant rebrandings in recent weeks, upending a series of commercial \u2014 and, yes, cultural \u2014 landmarks by which many modern human beings sort each other, carve out identities and recognize the world around them.",
      "Campbell's, the soupy, 155-year-old American icon immortalized in pop culture decades ago by Andy Warhol, is ready for a new, soupless name. Comcast\u2019s corporate reorganization means that there will soon be two television networks with \u201cNBC\u201d in their name \u2014 CNBC and MSNBC \u2014 that will no longer have any corporate connection to NBC News, a U.S. legacy news outlet.",
      "One could even argue that the United States itself is rebranding a bit with the election this month of former President Donald Trump and Republican majorities in the House and Senate in a divided nation. Unlike Trump's first election in 2016, he won the popular vote in what many called a national referendum on American identity.",
      "Are we, then, the sum total of our consumer decisions \u2014 what we buy, where we travel and whom we elect?",
      "Certainly, it's a question for those privileged enough to be able to afford such choices. But volumes of research in the art and science of branding \u2014 from \u201cbrandr,\u201d an old Norse word for burning symbols into the hides of livestock \u2014 say those factors do contribute to the modern sense of identity. So rebranding, especially of heritage names, can be a deeply felt affront to consumers.",
      "\u201cIt can feel like the brand is turning its back on everything that it stood for \u2014 and therefore it feels like its turning its back on us, the people who subscribe to that idea or ideology,\u201d said Ali Marmaduke, strategy director with the Amsterdam-based Brand Potential.",
      "He said cultural tension \u2014 polarization \u2014 in 2024 is surging over politics, wars in Russia and the Mideast, the environment, public health and more, creating what Marmaduke said is known as a \u201cpolycrisis:\u201d the idea that there are several massive crises converging and that feel scary and complex.",
      "\u201cPeople are understandably freaked out by that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are looking for something that will help us navigate this changing, threatening world that we face.\u201d",
      "Trump's \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d qualifies. So did President Joe Biden's \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d slogan atop his legislative plan. And Campbell's soup itself \u2014 \u201cMmm Mmm Good\u201d \u2014 isn't going anywhere, its CEO, Mark Clouse, said in a statement. The company's new name, Campbell\u2019s Co., will reflect \u201cthe full breadth of our portfolio,\u201d which for some time has included brands like Prego pasta sauce and Goldfish crackers.",
      "None of the recent activity around heritage brands has sparked a backlash as ferocious as Jaguar's. It's a company that has stood as a pillar of tradition-loving British identity since World War II.",
      "The rebrand, which includes a new logo, is slated to launch Dec. 2 during Miami Art Week, when the company will unveil a new electric GT model. Jaguar said in its press release that its approach was rooted in the philosophy of its founder, Sir William Lyons, to \u201ccopy nothing.\u201d",
      "What it's calling \u201cthe new Jaguar\u201d will overhaul everything from the font of its name to the positioning of it's famous \u201cleaper\u201d cat. \u201cExuberant modernism\u201d will \u201cdefine all aspects of the new Jaguar world,\u201d according to the press release. The approach is thought to be aimed at selling fewer cars at a six-figure price point to a more diverse customer base.",

    "story": [
      "The reaction of those who defended \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski for meeting with President-elect Trump sounds almost quaint in the days of opinionated journalism",
      "One of the striking things about how furiously many people reacted to the news last week that MSNBC \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski met with President-Elect Donald Trump was how quaint their defenders sounded.",
      "\u201cIt is insane for critics to NOT think all of us in the media need to know more so we can share/report more,\u201d Jim VandeHei, co-founder of Axios and Politico, said on social media.",
      "It would be journalistic malpractice for the hosts of a morning television news program not to take a meeting with a president-elect, right? But \u201cMorning Joe\u201d isn't traditional journalism, and last week's incident is a telling illustration of the broader trend of impartial fact-finding being crowded out in the marketplace by opinionated news and the expectations that creates.",
      "Scarborough, a former congressman, and his wife, veteran newswoman Brzezinski, didn't just talk about the presidential campaign from their four-hour weekday perch. They tirelessly and emotionally advocated for Democrat Kamala Harris, likening Trump to a fascist-in-waiting.",
      "\u201cThey have portrayed themselves as bastions of integrity standing up to a would-be dictator,\u201d says Frank Sesno, a former CNN Washington bureau chief now professor at George Washington University's school of media and public affairs. \u201cWhat the followers see is the daily procession of people on the show constantly talking about the evils of Donald Trump and then Joe and Mika show up and have high tea with the guy.\u201d",
      "The social media blowback was instant and intense. \u201cYou do not need to talk to Hitler to cover him effectively,\u201d was one of the nicer messages.",
      "More telling is the people who have responded with action.",
      "\u201cMorning Joe\u201d had 770,000 viewers last Monday, its audience \u2014 like many shows on MSNBC \u2014 down from its yearly average of 1.09 million because some of the network's liberal-leaning viewers have tuned away after what they regard as depressing election results. That's the day Scarborough and Brzezinski announced they had met with Trump the previous Friday.",
      "By Tuesday, the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d audience had slipped to 680,000, according to the Nielsen company, and Wednesday's viewership was 647,000. Thursday rebounded to 707,000. It's only three days of data, but those are the kind of statistics about which television executives brood.",
      "\u201cThe audience for the polarized news-industrial complex has become unforgiving,\u201d says Kate O'Brian, outgoing head of news of the E.W. Scripps Co.",
      "The Washington Post learned this last month when it lost a reported 250,000 subscribers \u2014 presumably the bulk of them non-Trump supporters \u2014 after announcing it would not endorse a candidate for president. A draft of an editorial endorsing Harris had already been in the works.",
      "Mixing news and opinion isn't new; many U.S. newspapers in the 1800s were unabashedly partisan. But for most of the past century, there was a vigorous effort to separate the two. Broadcast television, licensed to serve the public interest, built up fact-based news divisions. What began to change things was the success of Fox News in building a conservative audience that believed it was underserved and undervalued.",
      "Now there's a vigorous industry catering to people who want to see their points of view reflected \u2014 and are less interested in reporting or any content that contradicts them.",
      "The most notable trend in 2024 campaign coverage was the diminishing influence of so-called legacy news brands in favor of outlets like podcasts that offered publicity-hungry politicians a friendly, if not supportive, home. Trump, for example, visited several podcasters, including the influential Joe Rogan, who awarded Trump with an endorsement.",
      "\u201cI won't even call it journalism,\u201d Sesno says. \u201cIt's storytelling.\u201d",
      "The past decade's journey of Megyn Kelly is one illustration of how opinion can pay off in today's climate. Once one of the more aggressive reporters at Fox News, she angered Trump in a 2015 debate with a pointed question about his treatment of women. She moved to the legacy outlet NBC News, but that didn't work for her. She has since started a flourishing podcast with conservative, and Trump-friendly, opinion.",
      "Among cable TV-based news brands, CNN has tried hardest to present an image of impartiality, even if many conservatives disagree. So the collapse in its ratings has been noteworthy: the network's audience of 4.7 million people for its election night coverage was essentially half the 9.1 million people it had for the same night in 2020.",
      "O'Brian is leaving Scripps at the end of the year because it is ending its 24-hour television news network after finding impartiality was a tough business. Scripps is continuing a streaming news product.",
      "That's the environment Scarborough and Brzezinski work in on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are very talented show hosts,\u201d Sesno says. \u201cBut they are not out on the front lines doing journalism, seeking truth in the way that a professional journalist does.\u201d",
      "Hours after the hosts' announcement that they had met with Trump, an MSNBC colleague, legal contributor and correspondent Katie Phang, said on X that \u201cnormalizing Trump is a bad idea.\u201d Scarborough had made a point of saying that was not what he was attempting to do.",
      "\u201cIt's not up to you or your corrupt industry to \u2018normalize\u2019 or not \u2018normalize' any politician who wins an election fair & square,\u201d Christina Pushaw, the pugnacious aide to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, replied to Phang. \u201cAmericans had their say; Trump will be your president come January whether you \u2018normalize\u2019 it or not. I would suggests journos should accept reality.\u201d",
      "Quaintness alert: Sesno is among those who believe the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts did the right thing.",
      "Whatever the motivations \u2014 and there are some who believe that worries that a Trump administration could make life difficult very difficult for them was on the hosts' minds \u2014 opening a line of communication to ensure that a show based on politics is not completely cut off from the thinking of a presidential administration makes business sense, he says. A little humility doesn't hurt.",
      "Even if her own job has proven that it's not a great business now, Scripps' O'Brian has seen enough focus groups of people who yearn for a more traditional journalism-based approach to believe in its importance.",
      "\u201cI think that there is still a need for nonpartisan news,\" says the former longtime ABC News producer, \u201cand maybe what brings it back to where it used to be will be an exhaustion from the hyper-polarized climate that we currently live in.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Justice Department and Google have made their closing arguments in a trial alleging Google&rsquo;s online advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department and Google have made their closing arguments in a trial alleging Google\u2019s online advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Google, already facing a possible breakup of the company over its ubiquitous search engine, is fighting to beat back another attack by the U.S. Department of Justice alleging monopolistic conduct, this time over technology that puts online advertising in front of consumers.",
      "The Justice Department and Google made closing arguments Monday in a trial alleging Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, will decide the case and is expected to issue a written ruling by the end of the year. If Brinkema finds Google has engaged in illegal, monopolistic conduct, she will then hold further hearings to explore what remedies should be imposed.",
      "The Justice Department, along with a coalition of states, has already said it believes Google should be forced to sell off parts of its ad tech business, which generates tens of billions of dollars annually for the Mountain View, California-based company.",
      "After roughly a month of trial testimony earlier this year, the arguments in the case remain the same.",
      "During three hours of arguments Monday, Brinkema, who sometimes tips her hand during legal arguments, did little to indicate how she might rule. She did, though, question the applicability of a key antitrust case Google cites in its defense.",
      "The Justice Department contends Google built and maintained a monopoly in \u201copen-web display advertising,\u201d essentially the rectangular ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of the page when one browses websites.",
      "Google dominates all facets of the market. A technology called DoubleClick is used pervasively by news sites and other online publishers, while Google Ads maintains a cache of advertisers large and small looking to place their ads on the right webpage in front of the right consumer.",
      "In between is another Google product, AdExchange, that conducts nearly instantaneous auctions matching advertisers to publishers.",
      "In court papers, Justice Department lawyers say Google \u201cis more concerned with acquiring and preserving its trifecta of monopolies than serving its own publisher and advertiser customers or winning on the merits.\u201d",
      "As a result, content providers and news organizations have never been able to generate the online revenue they should due to Google\u2019s excessive fees for brokering transactions between advertisers and publishers, the government says.",
      "Google argues the government's case improperly focuses on a narrow niche of online advertising. If one looks more broadly at online advertising to include social media, streaming TV services, and app-based advertising, Google says it controls as little as 10% of the market, a share that is dwindling as it faces increased and evolving competition.",
      "Google alleges in court papers that the government\u2019s lawsuit \u201cboil(s) down to the persistent complaints of a handful of Google\u2019s rivals and several mammoth publishers.\u201d",
      "Google also says it has invested billions in technology that facilitates the efficient match of advertisers to interested consumers and it should not be forced to share its technology and success with competitors.",
      "\u201cRequiring a company to do further engineering work to make its technology and customers accessible by all of its competitors on their preferred terms has never been compelled by U.S. antitrust law,\u201d the company wrote.",
      "Brinkema, during Monday's arguments, also sought clarity on Google\u2019s market share, a number the two sides dispute, depending on how broadly the market is defined.",
      "Historically, courts have been unwilling to declare an illegal monopoly in markets in which a company holds less than a 70% market share. Google says that when online display advertising is viewed as a whole, it holds only a 10% market share, and dwindling.",
      "The Justice Department contends, though, that when focusing on open-web display advertising, Google controls 91% of the market for publisher ad servers and 87% of the market for advertiser ad networks.",
      "Google says that the \u201copen web display advertising\u201d market is gerrymandered by the Justice Department to make Google look bad, and that nobody in the industry looks at that category of ads without considering the ability of advertisers to switch to other forms of advertising, like in mobile apps.",
      "The Justice Department also contends that the public is harmed by the excessive rates Google charges to facilitate ad purchases, saying the company takes 36 cents on the dollar when it facilitates the transaction end to end.",
      "Google says its \u201ctake rate\u201d has dropped to 31% and continues to decrease, and it says that rate is lower than that of its competitors.",
      "\u201cWhen you have an integrated system, one of the benefits is lower prices,\" Google lawyer Karen Dunn said Monday.",
      "The Virginia case is separate from an ongoing lawsuit brought against Google in the District of Columbia over its namesake search engine. In that case, the judge determined it constitutes an illegal monopoly but has not decided what remedy to impose.",
      "The Justice Department said last week it will seek to force Google to sell its Chrome web browser, among a host of other penalties. Google has said the department's request is overkill and unhinged from legitimate regulation.",
      "In Monday's arguments, Justice Department lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum cited the search engine case when he highlighted an email from a Google executive, David Rosenblatt, who said in a 2009 email that Google\u2019s goal was to \u201cdo to display what Google did to search,\" which Teitelbaum said showed the company's intent to achieve market dominance.",
      "\u201cGoogle did not achieve its trifecta of monopolies by accident,\u201d Teitelbaum said."

Still, the flock is down about 3% over the past year, contributing to a 4% drop in egg production, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "The latest wave of bird flu is scrambling supplies of cage-free eggs because California has been among the hardest hit states. California, Nevada, Washington and Oregon all require eggs sold in their states to be cage-free.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re having to move eggs from other areas of the country that are producing cage-free to cover that low supply in those states, because those states only allow for cage-free eggs to be sold,\u201d Metz said.",
      "Cage-free requirements are set to go into effect in Arizona, Colorado and Michigan next year and in Rhode Island and Utah in 2030.",
      "Demand for such specialty eggs may also be contributing to avian flu, which is spread through the droppings of wild birds as they migrate past farms. Allowing chickens to roam more freely puts them at greater risk, said Chad Hart, a professor and agricultural economist at Iowa State University.",
      "\u201cIt's really hard to control that interaction between domesticated birds and wild birds,\u201d Hart said. \"Some of those vectors have been opened up because we\u2019re asking the egg industry to produce in ways that we didn\u2019t ask them to before.\u201d",
      "Metz said climate change and extreme weather are also blowing some wild birds off course.",
      "\u201cWe have birds that have been displaced by hurricanes, by wildfires, and those birds are now circulating in areas that they otherwise might not circulate or at times of the year that they otherwise may not be circulating,\" she said. \"And those are all new variables that our farmers are having to deal with.\u201d",
      "Hart said the egg industry is trying to rebuild the flock, but that also can limit supplies, since farmers have to hold back some eggs to hatch into new chickens.",
      "Still, there is some good news on U.S. poultry farms. The price of chicken feed \u2014 which represents 70% of a farmer's costs \u2014 has fallen significantly after doubling between 2020 and 2022, Hart said.",

      "A last round of negotiations on a legally binding treaty to address the global scourge of plastic pollution has opened in Busan, South Korea. Here's what to know about it:",
      "National delegations still have a lot to hammer out before there is a treaty. Most contentious is whether there will be a limit on the amount of plastic that companies are allowed to produce.",
      "Led by Norway and Rwanda, 66 countries plus the European Union say they want to address the total plastic on Earth by controlling plastic design, production, consumption and what happens at the end of its life.",
      "Some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, including Saudi Arabia, vigorously oppose such limits.",
      "Global plastics production is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, up 70% from 2020, without policy changes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.",
      "Negotiators must also decide whether the treaty will reduce or eliminate single-use plastics. They'll have to resolve whether to end the use of hazardous chemicals in plastics and whether these steps will be mandated or merely encouraged.",
      "Their common objective is to protect human health and the environment.",
      "There are some things many countries agree on. They want provisions in a treaty to promote the redesign of plastic products so they can be recycled and reused. They want to invest to better manage plastic waste. They want to increase recycling rates and help waste pickers transition to safer jobs. There is agreement that there needs to be a mechanism to help countries pay for anything required of them.",
      "Graham Forbes, who is leading a Greenpeace delegation in Busan, said his group could support an agreement that puts sensible guardrails in place to reduce the amount of plastic produced, eliminates toxic chemicals and protects people from the uncontrolled use of plastics. That's achievable, but will take political leadership and courage not seen yet in earlier negotiations, he added.",
      "Frankie Orona, executive director of the Texas-based Society of Native Nations, said they demand a treaty that tackles the root causes of the crisis rather than just managing plastic waste.",
      "\u201cWe must seize this moment and leave a legacy we can be proud of, with a non-toxic sustainable future for all children and our children's children,\" he said.",

      "China, the United States and Germany led the global plastics trade by exports and imports in 2023, the association said.",
      "The plastics industry has been advocating for a treaty focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse, sometimes referred to as \u201ccircularity.\u201d Chris Jahn, International Council of Chemical Associations secretariat, said negotiators should focus on ending plastic waste in the environment, not plastic production, to get a deal. Many countries won\u2019t join a treaty if it includes production caps, he said.",
      "To continue to progress and grow as a global economy, there are going to be more plastics, Jahn added.",
      "\u201cSo we should strive then to keep those plastics in the economy and out of the environment,\u201d Jahn said.",
      "The United States delegation at first said countries should develop their own plans to act, a position viewed as favoring industry. It changed its position this summer, saying the U.S. is open to considering global targets for reductions in plastic production.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas has delayed a hearing in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars and turning it into a parody",
      "A bankruptcy judge on Monday delayed a hearing in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars, keeping the auction sale up in the air for at least another few weeks.",
      "Jones alleges fraud and collusion marred the bankruptcy auction that resulted in The Onion being named the winning bidder over a company affiliated with him. A trustee overseeing the auction denies the allegations and accuses Jones of launching a smear campaign because he didn't like the outcome.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez had been scheduled to hear an emergency motion to disqualify The Onion's bid on Monday, but put it off until either Dec. 9 or Dec. 17. That's also when the judge will hear arguments on the trustee's request to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion. Lopez said it made sense to have one hearing on both requests.",
      "\u201cI want a fair and transparent process and let\u2019s just see where the process goes,\" Lopez said.",
      "Lopez could ultimately allow The Onion to move forward with its purchase, order a new auction or name the other bidder as the winner. At stake is whether Jones gets to stay at Infowars\u2019 studio in Austin, Texas, under a new owner friendly to him, or whether he gets kicked out by The Onion.",
      "The other bidder, First United American Companies, runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements.",
      "Jones continues to broadcast his show from the Infowars studio, but he has set up a new location, websites and social media accounts as a precaution. The trustee shut down the Austin studio and Infowars' websites for about 24 hours last week after The Onion was announced as the winning bidder, but allowed them to resume the next day, drawing more complaints from Jones.",
      "Jones declared bankruptcy and liquidated his assets after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion to relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. He was ordered to pay damages for defamation and emotional distress in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas after he repeatedly said the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators was a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Proceeds from the liquidation are to go to Jones\u2019 creditors, including the Sandy Hook families who sued him.",
      "Last year, Lopez ruled that $1.1 billion of the Sandy Hook judgments could not be discharged in the bankruptcy. On Monday, he denied a request from Sandy Hook families to make the full $1.5 billion not dischargeable, meaning the debt cannot be wiped clean.",
      "Also Monday, lawyers for the social media platform X objected to any sale of the accounts of both Jones and Infowars, saying X is the owner of the accounts and it has not given consent for them to be sold or transferred. Jones' personal X account, with 3.3 million followers, was not part of the auction, but Lopez will be deciding if it should be included in the liquidation.",
      "Jones has praised X owner Elon Musk on his show and suggested that Musk should buy Infowars. Musk has not responded publicly to that suggestion and was not among the bidders.",
      "Jones was permanently banned from Twitter in 2018 for abusive behavior, but Musk restored Jones\u2019 account on the platform he has since renamed X in December last year.",
      "Jones alleges The Onion\u2019s bid was the result of fraud and collusion involving many of the Sandy Hook families, the humor site and the court-appointed trustee.",
      "First United American Companies submitted a $3.5 million sealed bid, while The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash. But The Onion's bid also included a pledge by Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, said that made The Onion's proposal better for creditors and he named it the winning bid.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies claimed that the bid violated Lopez\u2019s rules for the auction by including multiple entities and lacking a valid dollar amount. Jones also alleged Murray improperly canceled an expected round of live bidding and only selected from among the two sealed bids that were submitted.",
      "Jones called the auction \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d on his show, which airs on the Infowars website, radio stations and Jones' X account. He filed a counter lawsuit last week against Murray, The Onion's parent company and the Sandy Hook families in the bankruptcy court.",
      "In a court filing on Sunday, Murray called the allegations a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to delay the sale of Infowars to The Onion and accused Jones, his lawyers and attorneys for First United American Companies of a \u201cvicious smear campaign lobbing patently false accusations.\u201d He also alleged Jones collaborated with First United American Companies to try to buy Infowars.",
      "Lopez\u2019s September order on the auction procedures made a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "The assets of Infowars' parent company, Free Speech Systems, that were up for sale included the Austin studio, Infowars' video archive, video production equipment, product trademarks, and Infowars' websites and social media accounts. Another auction of remaining assets is set for Dec. 10.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights, but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate, guns and other belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Documents filed in court this year say Jones had about $9 million in personal assets, while Free Speech Systems had about $6 million in cash and more than $1 million worth of inventory."

      "Hundreds of supporters of India\u2019s main opposition party have protested against billionaire Gautam Adani, who was recently indicted in the U.S. for alleged fraud and bribery, and accused the government of protecting the Indian coal magnate whose compani...",
      "NEW DELHI -- Hundreds of supporters of India's main opposition party protested on Monday against billionaire Gautam Adani, who was recently indicted in the U.S. for alleged fraud and bribery, and accused the government of protecting the Indian coal magnate whose companies' shares have plunged since the charges last week.",
      "Activists belonging to the Congress party demonstrated near Parliament in New Delhi to demand the immediate arrest of Adani, who is seen as close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Some held up placards reading \u201cModi and Adani are one\u201d and \u201cModi's friendship is costing the nation.\" Several were detained by police.",
      "Also on Monday, opposition parties attempted to raise the Adani allegations in Parliament, but the session was adjourned over disruptions. They called for a joint committee to investigate his companies, which include agriculture, renewable energy, coal and infrastructure.",
      "Adani, 62, one of Asia's richest men, was thrust into the spotlight last week when U.S. prosecutors in New York charged him and seven of his associates with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud, alleging that Adani duped investors in a massive solar project in India by concealing that it was being facilitated by bribes.",
      "The indictment outlines an alleged scheme to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials in India.",
      "The government has not officially commented on the charges, which the Adani group has denied as baseless. On Saturday, the group's CFO said the indictment was linked to one contract of Adani Green, its renewable energy arm, that comprised 10% of its business, adding that none of the group's other companies was accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Ishita Sadha, part of the Congress party\u2019s youth wing, said the allegations were embarrassing for India. \u201cModi is keeping Adani safe,\u201d she said.",
      "After the indictment was unsealed last week, the Congress party's Rahul Gandhi said the Modi government was protecting Adani and that the billionaire wouldn't be arrested or investigated. \u201cThe prime minister's credibility has been destroyed. The entire country knows they (Adani and Modi) are one. We will expose the entire network,\u201d Gandhi told reporters.",
      "The main opposition bloc, called INDIA, led by the Congress party, has repeatedly called for investigations into Adani. They have hit out at the tycoon and his perceived links to the government since a U.S.-based short-selling firm released a report last year accusing the billionaire\u2019s companies of stock price manipulation and fraud.",
      "Adani denied those claims too, but the report triggered the selling of his companies\u2019 stock and an ongoing investigation by the country\u2019s market regulator. Market analysts say Adani had just about recovered from the shock from the report when the charges were announced, making it the biggest test yet for the beleaguered billionaire. A day after the indictment, his companies\u2019 stocks plunged up to 20%.",
      "Adani\u2019s imprint across India\u2019s economy runs deep. His group is the country\u2019s largest operator of coal mines and largest infrastructure developer, operating several ports and airports, and employs tens of thousands of people. Despite his fossil fuel roots, Adani has ambitions to become the world\u2019s largest player in renewable energy by 2030.",
      "Analysts say a key factor in his meteoric rise over the years has been his knack for aligning his group\u2019s priorities with those of the Modi government. His critics accuse him of crony capitalism and of gaining preferential treatment from the government, including in winning contracts, which the group has denied."

      "Supermarket giant Carrefour\u2019s support for French farmers\u2019 protests against a trade agreement between the European Union and the South American bloc Mercosur has sparked a strong reaction in Brazil",
      "BRASILIA, Brazil -- Supermarket giant Carrefour\u2019s support for French farmers\u2019 protests against a trade agreement between the European Union and the South American bloc Mercosur has sparked a strong reaction in Brazil, including a refusal to supply beef to Carrefour stores in Brazil.",
      "Carrefour CEO Alexandre Bompard announced in social media posts last week that the French company would stop buying beef from all Mercosur countries, which also include Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Bompard wrote that he agrees with French producers' arguments that Mercosur beef is an unfair competitor due to lower production costs resulting from fewer environmental and sanitary requirements.",
      "The executive encouraged other retailers to follow suit.",
      "Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture called Bompard's move protectionist, saying it was made \u201cwithout any technical criteria.\u201d",
      "The decision also angered Brazil's meatpackers. Though France makes up just a tiny sliver of Brazil\u2019s beef exports, meatpackers worried that Carrefour\u2019s decision would hurt its reputation in other markets.",
      "Beef giants JBS and Marfrig halted supplies last Friday to Carrefour's extensive supermarket chain in Brazil, including the food warehouse giant Atacadao. Both companies refused to comment on the boycott to The Associated Press, but Minister of Agriculture Carlos F\u00e1varo confirmed it.",
      "\u201cWe support the reaction of the meatpackers. If Brazil\u00b4s beef isn\u2019t good enough for Carrefour\u2019s shelves in France, it isn\u2019t good enough for Carrefour\u2019s shelves in Brazil either,\u201d Fav\u00e1ro told Folha de S.Paulo newspaper on Monday.",
      "Carrefour Group in Brazil acknowledged the boycott in a statement, though it said there's not yet a shortage of beef in stores. It said it has \u201cesteem and confidence in the Brazilian agricultural sector, with which it maintains a solid relationship and partnership.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the decision to suspend the meat supply has an impact on customers, especially those who rely on the company to supply their homes with quality and responsible products,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is in constant dialogue in search of solutions that will make it possible to resume the supply of meat to its stores as quickly as possible, respecting the commitments it has to its more than 130,000 Brazilian employees and millions of Brazilian customers countrywide.\u201d",
      "The backdrop for the conflict is the EU-Mercosur trade deal, which would increase agricultural imports to EU countries from South America. French farmers fear it will affect their livelihoods. An initial agreement was reached in 2019, but negotiations have faltered since then due to opposition that also includes some European governments.",
      "Brazil\u2019s agribusiness sector also fears that the pending European Union Deforestation Regulation will outlaw the sale of forest-derived products within the EU\u2019s 27-nation bloc if companies can\u2019t prove their goods are not linked to deforestation. Its scope includes soy and cattle, Brazil\u2019s top agricultural exports. Almost half of the country\u2019s cattle is raised in the Amazon region, where 90% of deforested land since 1985 has turned into pasture, according to MapBiomas, a nonprofit network. The date of its implementation remains uncertain.",

    "story": [
      "American Airlines says it doesn\u2019t expect significant disruptions to flights this week as a result of a labor strike at its hub in Charlotte, North Carolina",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Workers who clean airplanes, remove trash and help with wheelchairs at Charlotte's airport, one of the nation's busiest, went on strike Monday during a busy week of Thanksgiving travel to demand higher wages.",
      "The Service Employees International Union announced the strike in a statement early Monday, saying the workers would demand \u201can end to poverty wages and respect on the job during the holiday travel season.\u201d The strike was expected to last 24 hours, said union spokesperson Sean Keady.",
      "Employees of ABM and Prospect Airport Services cast ballots Friday to authorize the work stoppage at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, a hub for American Airlines. The two companies contract with American, one of the world's biggest carriers, to provide services such as cleaning airplane interiors, removing trash and escorting passengers in wheelchairs.",
      "American doesn\u2019t expect \u201cany significant disruption\u201d to its flights this week as a result of the strike, the company said in a statement. More than 30 American flights at the Charlotte airport \u2014 about 4% of the airline's flights \u2014 were delayed at midafternoon Monday, according to FlightAware, which isn\u2019t out of the ordinary.",
      "Workers say they previously complained that they can't afford basic necessities, including food, housing or car repairs. They described living paycheck to paycheck while performing jobs that keep planes running on schedule. Most of them earn $12.50 to $19 an hour, union officials said.",
      "Those workers should make $22 to $25 an hour, said the Rev. Glencie Rhedrick, of Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, at an SEIU Airport Workers United rally across from the airport. She was joined by striking employees and advocates, many raising signs that read, \u201cRespect Black and Brown workers\u201d and \u201cRespect, Protect, Pay Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe cannot live on the wages that we are being paid,\u201d ABM cabin cleaner Priscilla Hoyle said at the rally. \u201cI can honestly say it's hard every single day with my children, working a full-time job but having to look my kids in the eyes and sit there and say, \u2018I don\u2019t know if we're going to have a home today.'\u201d",
      "At some airports in the Northeast, workers make more because of local wage ordinances, said Chris Baumann, a regional director for the union. But that's not the case in some Southern cities like Charlotte, he said, so workers are \u201casking the contractors to step up and do the right thing.\u201d",
      "ABM said in a statement Monday that it would take steps to minimize the strike's impact on travelers. There are avenues for employees to communicate issues, the company said, including a national hotline and a \u201cgeneral open door policy for managers at our worksite.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe keep employee safety and job satisfaction at the forefront of everything we do, and we are committed to addressing concerns swiftly,\u201d ABM said.",
      "Prospect Airport Services said last week that the company recognized the seriousness of the potential for a strike during the busy holiday travel season. It did not respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "About 800 workers were affected by the union\u2019s push for higher wages, but an exact number who participated in the work stoppage was unclear, said union spokesperson Ana Tinsly.",
      "Timothy Lowe II, a Prospect wheelchair attendant, said at the rally that he has heard of co-workers having to sleep in their cars or in U-Hauls because they can't afford rent. At the end of his shifts, Lowe said, he has to figure out where to spend the night because he doesn't make enough for a deposit on a home.",
      "\u201cWe just want to be able to have everything that\u2019s a necessity paid for by the job that hired us to do a great job so they can make billions,\u201d he said.",
      "Charlotte airport officials have said this holiday travel season is expected to be the busiest on record, with an estimated 1.02 million passengers departing the airport between last Thursday and the Monday after Thanksgiving. Airport officials said in a statement Monday morning that they were \u201cmonitoring and actively engaged with all partners to ensure terminal operations are not impacted,\u201d noting that the striking workers aren\u2019t employed by the city\u2019s aviation department.",
      "The union's North Carolina director, Niecy Brown, said at the rally that many people will travel through the Charlotte airport for Thanksgiving to spend time with family, but that the striking workers won't have that same holiday experience because of low wages. Instead, striking employees attended a \u201cStrikesgiving\u201d lunch Monday.",
      "\u201cThey don't have a table to go to; they don't have a home to go to,\u201d Brown said.",

      "Reporting by The Associated Press about abusive culture in Oregon State\u2019s volleyball program led to an outpouring of similar stories from the coach\u2019s homeland of Australia",
      "Reporting by The Associated Press about abusive culture in Oregon State's volleyball program led to an outpouring of similar stories from the coach's homeland of Australia, where a four-year process led officials there to apologize to athletes who had played in his program.",
      "The Australian Broadcasting Corporation published a story Saturday quoting players who read the AP reporting in 2020 about Oregon State's Mark Barnard and, according to one, felt \"it was like reading one of our own training sessions.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just started shaking, my heart started racing,\u201d one player, Selina Scoble, told ABC.",
      "Scoble said her difficulties on the team \u201csnowballed into depression and bulimia, and I have a lot of shame and guilt around that.\u201d",
      "The AP investigation cited more than a dozen players who told of an abusive culture at Oregon State. Among their allegations were that Barnard, who left the program in 2022, pitted players against each other in team meetings while he was there and pushed them past health warnings in practice as punishment.",
      "The so-called coach-on-one drills the Oregon State players described \u2014 in which coaches make players dive after difficult-to-retrieve balls they throw \u2014 were the same drills Barnard ran as both an assistant, then later the head coach at what was then Australia's nascent women's volleyball program being run by the country's Institute of Sport.",
      "\u201cOn any given day, we were fearful for our physical being, for our emotional being,\u201d Elizabeth Brett, one of the first players recruited to the Australian team, told ABC.",
      "Brett quit volleyball after the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where the Aussie women finished ninth.",
      "\u201cI still don\u2019t sleep on Sunday nights,\u201d Brett said. \u201cThat physiological response stayed with me and the anxiety around it.\u201d",
      "ABC said the day after the AP report came out, Volleyball Australia, which oversees elite and Olympic volleyball in the country, published a letter of support for Barnard on its Facebook page, and that the letter galvanized the players and motivated them to speak up.",
      "\u201cThat post itself was infuriating for the group, because it was without any consultation with any of the past players,\u201d said one of the players, Rowena Morgan.",
      "Morgan described Barnard as a coach who could diffuse situations when he served as an assistant but said his personality changed once he became the man in charge.",
      "\u201cHe would yell abuse and nothing was good enough,\u201d Morgan told ABC. \u201cYou know: \u2018You\u2019re (expletive) useless. You\u2019re weak. If you played any other sport, you\u2019d never get anywhere. You\u2019re pathetic. You disgust me.\u2019 That sort of thing.\u201d",
      "The players' outpouring triggered a review by Sports Integrity Australia, which included interviews with 27 participants, including medical staff, and 16 written submissions.",
      "The review, completed in 2022, found the program from 1997-2005 fostered a culture of fear and punishment, unacceptable training practices, an inadequate complaints-handling procedure, a lack of coach accountability and limited athlete support.",
      "It took two more years for Volleyball Australia to issue a public apology to the players. Without mentioning Barnard or Brad Saindon, who served as head coach of the Aussie program before him, with Barnard as his assistant, the apology acknowledged the former players suffered through \u201can environment of fear.\"",
      "As part of the AP reporting, Oregon State disputed allegations that players were pushed past their physical limits as punishment and said \u201cappropriate action was taken\u201d after an internal investigation into Barnard's program.",
      "The OSU players said they never felt heard by the university and that their complaints were either swept under the rug or not looked into appropriately.",
      "Two of the players who spoke to the AP said they considered suicide. One of them, upon reading the first AP story in the series, said she \u201cgenuinely thought the article was written about me,\u201d even thought it was about a different player.",
      "Both those players were among more than a dozen who quit or transferred from the Oregon State program during Barnard's tenure, with some saying they were forced out.",
      "The coach, who came to Oregon State as an assistant in 2005, then went 70-132 over seven seasons as head coach, left the school after the 2022 season. The school thanked him for his \u201clong-time commitment to our athletic department\u201d but made no mention of the abuse allegations.",
      "Barnard did not immediately return messages left by the AP seeking his comment about the ABC report. Saindon told ABC, \u201cI\u2019m not that kind of a coach, I\u2019ve never done that in my whole coaching career, let alone to the young women on the national team in Australia.\u201d",
      "After the first two AP stories were published, Oregon State went to court to fight the AP's efforts to obtain documents related to Barnard's case. The AP received a favorable ruling from the local district attorney when it first pressed for the documents, but the university spent more than two years fighting the disclosure. Oregon State ultimately paid the AP\u2019s legal fees in exchange for AP agreeing to drop the request.",
      "During the legal wrangling, Oregon State spokesman Steve Clark said the school fought the disclosure because if records were released, it \"would have a chilling effect and potentially stymie people with concerns from ever reporting allegations of wrongdoing.\u201d",

      "The M-V-P chants weren't only directed at Cleveland All-Star Donvan Mitchell on Sunday night",
      "CLEVELAND -- As the Cavaliers were pushing their home record to 10-0 and improving the franchise's historic start to an eye-popping 17-1, a solitary voice rose from the seats that could be heard throughout the lower bowl of Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse.",
      "\"M-V-P! M-V-P!\u201d the lone fan chanted.",
      "Down on the floor, Donovan Mitchell noticed. However, it wasn't directed at the five-time All-Star, but a teammate shooting free throws.",
      "Later, Ty Jerome wanted proof it happened.",
      "\"Did you get it on video?\u201d the reserve guard asked.",
      "Cleveland's unexpected start has produced an unexpected rising star.",
      "After missing all but two games last season with a severe ankle injury that dragged on and required surgery, Jerome has not only become an invaluable piece for first-year Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson but is emblematic of the team's early-season success.",
      "This wasn't expected \u2014 not by the Cavs and certainly not by Jerome.",
      "\u201cHe's in this zone,\u201d Atkinson said of the 27-year-old Jerome, already with his fourth NBA team. \u201cIt's phenomenal.\u201d",
      "While he's been good from the jump this season, Jerome has taken his game to another level this past week.",
      "One night after the Cavs lost in Boston after 15 straight wins, Jerome made seven 3-pointers \u2014 two on Steph Curry-like heat checks just inside the halfcourt logo \u2014 in the first half and finished with a career-high 29 points in a win over New Orleans.",
      "For an encore on Sunday, he matched Mitchell, his longtime friend and boyhood teammate in New York, with 26 points and six assists as the Cavs downed Toronto.",
      "That performance prompted the MVP chant from the fan who once reserved the somewhat sarcastic salute for popular Cavs sub Cedi Osman.",
      "Jerome has a been a marvel since the beginning of training camp, when he made a first impression on Atkinson that has only grown stronger.",
      "\u201cSince the moment he stepped in our gym,\u201d Atkinson said when asked how long he knew Jerome would be a major contributor this season. \u201cHe\u2019s been phenomenal every day. I mean, (general manager) Koby (Altman) jokes about MVP of August, September, October. We're all expecting, not expecting, but when is it going to start dipping?",
      "\"OK, it\u2019s open gym. OK, it\u2019s training camp. OK, first five games. He just keeps going and it's a real, real credit to him. He\u2019s just in a state of grace right now. It\u2019s beautiful to watch.\u201d",
      "The same could be said for the Cavs, whose burst from the gate under Atkinson is one of the league's best stories. The 57-year-old Atkinson, an affable, fast-talking hoops junkie from Long Island, has made Cleveland an offensive powerhouse.",
      "The Cavs lead the league in virtually every statistical category \u2014 points, field-goal percentage, 3-point percentage, point differential and offensive rating. It's a system based on pace, ball movement and fundamentals and it's hard to defend.",
      "\u201cA chaotic environment with standard principles,\u201d Atkinson said.",
      "Atkinson is getting the best from Cleveland's core four of players \u2014 Mitchell, Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen \u2014 while also developing his bench, something predecessor J.B. Bickerstaff struggled to do.",
      "Jerome, who played on Virginia's national championship team in 2019, gives Atkinson a multi-skilled player capable on both ends of the floor. He's come off the bench to provide points or a key assist, and Atkinson deploys him defensively to pester point guards.",
      "\u201cIt's hard to take him out of the game,\u201d Atkinson said. \"He\u2019s in every conversation at all times. \u2018Do we need Ty in there?\u2019 He\u2019s playing phenomenally.\u201d",
      "Mitchell isn't surprised. He's goes way back with Jerome, playing with him on a Riverside (N.Y.) Hawks youth team coached by Jerome's dad.",
      "\u201cHis dad used to cuss us out at 8 years old,\u201d Mitchell said with a smile. \u201cI tell people all the time that I don\u2019t like positive reinforcement. I think it\u2019s just PTSD from my AAU days with his pops. Getting chewed out at 9 a.m. definitely is something that you don\u2019t forget.\u201d",
      "Mitchell also finds it funny that Jerome's comeback is getting such attention.",
      "\u201cY\u2019all be saying that like he died and came back to life,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201dFor him to come back, not only be a solid player, but be dominant, be a special player for us, it kind of gives us life.

      "\u201cCrazy \u2014 there\u2019s no other word for it,\u201d the 55-year-old said less than a week after he was fired by the Boston Bruins and hired by St. Louis to replace Drew Bannister. \u201cI have worked with over half this lineup already, and I know how committed they are. For me, this was a no-brainer for me to come back home.\"",
      "The Blues \u2014 who missed the playoffs last season after Bannister took over for 2019 Stanley Cup-winning coach Craig Berube in December \u2014 have work to do. They started the season 9-12-1, only two teams have scored less than their 2.36 goals a game and they rank in the bottom third of the league on the power play and penalty kill.",

I guess I was a T-bone that day.\"",
      "Every NHL team Montgomery has coached for a full season has qualified for the playoffs, and his .659 points percentage ranks among the best in league history.",
      "\u201cI believe in this group,\" Montgomery said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to make the playoffs in this league. Half the teams miss it. But I do think that in time this is a caliber playoff team.\u201d",
      "Blues players reacted positively to the coaching change.",

      "Robert Thomas, a first-round draft pick by St. Louis in 2017 now in his seventh season with the Blues, said he was sorry to see Bannister go but happy the energetic Montgomery was back as head coach.",

      "A judge on Monday rejected a request to block a San Jose State women\u2019s volleyball team member from playing in a conference tournament on grounds that she is transgender.",
      "The ruling by U.S. Magistrate Judge S. Kato Crews in Denver will allow the player, who has played all season, to compete in the Mountain West Conference women\u2019s championship this week in Las Vegas.",
      "The ruling comes in a lawsuit filed by nine current players against the conference challenging league policies for allowing transgender players to participate. The players argued that letting her compete poses a safety risk and is unfair.",
      "While some media have reported those and other details, neither San Jose State nor the forfeiting teams have confirmed the school has a trans woman volleyball player. The Associated Press is withholding the player\u2019s name because she has not commented publicly on her gender identity. School officials also have declined an interview request with the player.",
      "Crews' ruling referred to the athlete as an \u201calleged transgender\u201d player and noted that no defendant disputed that the San Jose State roster includes a transgender woman player.",
      "San Jose State will \"continue to support its student-athletes and reject discrimination in all forms,\" the university said in a statement, confirming all its student-athletes are eligible to participate under NCAA and conference rules. \u201cWe are gratified that the Court rejected an eleventh-hour attempt to change those rules. Our team looks forward to competing in the Mountain West volleyball tournament this week.\"",
      "The conference said it was \u201csatisfied\u201d with the judge's decision and would continue upholding policies established by its board of directors, which \u201cdirectly align with NCAA and USA Volleyball.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are excited to proceed with the Mountain West Conference Women's Volleyball Championship,\u201d its statement added.",
      "The players filed a notice for emergency appeal with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "Crews said the players could have sought relief much earlier, noting the individual universities had acknowledged that not playing their games against San Jose State this season would result in a loss in league standings. He refused a request to re-seed the tournament without the forfeited losses.",
      "The judge said injunctions are meant to preserve the status quo. The conference policy regarding forfeiting for refusing to play against a team with a transgender player had been in effect since 2022 and the San Jose State player has been on the roster since 2022 -\u2013 making that the status quo.",
      "The player competed at the college level three previous seasons, including two for San Jose State, drawing little attention. This season\u2019s awareness of her reported identity led to an uproar among some players, parents and also politicians in a major election year.",
      "Crews' ruling also said injunctions are meant to prevent harm, but in this case, he argued, the harm has already occurred. The games have been forfeited, the tournament has been seeded and the participants have confirmed they're playing.",
      "The tournament starts Wednesday and continues Friday and Saturday. Colorado State is seeded first and San Jose State, second. The teams split their regular-season matches and both get byes into Friday's semifinals.",
      "San Jose State will play the winner of Wednesday's match between Utah State and Boise State \u2014 teams that forfeited matches to SJSU during the regular season. Boise State associate athletic director Chris Kutz declined to comment on whether the Broncos would play SJSU if they won their first-round tournament game. Utah State associate athletic director Doug Hoffman said the university is reviewing the order and the team is preparing for Wednesday's match.",
      "The tournament winner gets an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. San Jose State coach Todd Kress, whose team hasn't competed in the national tournament since 2001, has said they've been getting \u201cmessages of hate\u201d that have taken a toll on the players.",
      "Several teams refused to play against San Jose State this season, earning losses in the official conference standings. Boise State and Wyoming each had two forfeits while Utah State and Nevada both had one. Southern Utah, a member of the Western Athletic Conference, was the first to cancel against San Jose State this year.",
      "Nevada\u2019s players stated they \u201crefuse to participate in any match that advances injustice against female athletes,\u201d without elaborating. Nevada didn't qualify for the conference tournament.",
      "The nine current players and others now suing the Mountain West Conference, the California State University Board of Trustees and others include San Jose State senior setter and co-captain Brooke Slusser. Slusser says the player is transgender and hits the volleyball with more force than other teammates, raising fear during practices of suffering concussions from a head hit, according to the complaint.",
      "The Independent Council on Women\u2019s Sports is funding a separate lawsuit against the NCAA for allowing transgender women to compete in women\u2019s sports. Both lawsuits claim the landmark 1972 federal antidiscrimination law known as Title IX prohibits transgender women in women\u2019s sports. Title IX prohibits sexual discrimination in federally funded education; Slusser is a plaintiff in both lawsuits.",
      "Several circuit courts have used a U.S. Supreme Court ruling to conclude that discriminating against someone based on their transgender status or sexual orientation is sex-based discrimination, Crews wrote. That means case law does not prove the \u201clikelihood of success\u201d needed to grant an injunction.",
      "An NCAA policy that subjects transgender participation to the rules of sports governing bodies took effect this academic year. USA Volleyball says a trans woman must suppress testosterone for 12 months before competing. The NCAA has not flagged any issues with San Jose State.",
      "The Republican governors of Idaho, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming have made public statements in support of the team cancellations, citing fairness in women\u2019s sports. President-elect Donald Trump likewise has spoken out against allowing transgender women to compete in women\u2019s sports.",

      "Jaxon Smith-Njigba had six catches for 77 yards and the first offensive touchdown against the Cardinals (6-5) in three weeks. But it was the defense that made the difference for the Seahawks (6-5) against their division rivals, who had their four-game winning streak snapped.",
      "\u201cI thought he was dominant,\u201d Seattle coach Mike Macdonald said of Williams. \u201cI knew he played great and then I looked at the stat line and I realized he played out of his mind.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever run that fast,\u201d said Bryant, who finished the score with a dive into the end zone that resembled Marshawn Lynch's \u201cBeast Mode\u201d celebration. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to get fined, so hopefully Marshawn saw it.\u201d",
      "Murray drove the Cardinals to the Seattle 4 early in the fourth quarter, but Arizona settled for a 22-yard field goal by Chad Ryland.

      "It was the first touchdown allowed by the Cardinals' defense since the fourth quarter against Miami three weeks ago.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- James Harden was about booed out of the arena each time he touched the ball, a sound of contempt not heard in Philly since \u2014 well, since Ben Simmons was razzed with much the same vocal voraciousness two nights earlier.",
      "The 76ers turned back the clock \u2014 \u201cway back,\u201d the public address announcer noted \u2014 wearing uniforms Sunday night designed to pay homage to their old home, the Spectrum.",
      "Their old players? Well, they hit Philly, too.",
      "Simmons, a former No. 1 pick once deemed a franchise cornerstone, returned Friday night with Brooklyn while Harden, now banging 3s with the Los Angeles Clippers, had his unceremonious homecoming Sunday night.",
      "Simmons and Harden each raised the promise of deep playoff runs \u2014 yes, even a championship \u2014 before their sensational starts with the Sixers disintegrated into toxic tenures full of ill will and, ultimately, a feeling of good riddance from all parties involved.",
      "Simmons and his shooting woes; Harden and his contract demands; no matter the symptoms for seasonal dysfunction through the years, the headache still pounds in Philadelphia.",
      "The malady these days: bad knees.",
      "Joel Embiid and Paul George, who signed $405 million worth of contracts in the offseason, remained pinned to the bench with knee injuries. George, a left knee bone bruise. Embiid, swelling in his left knee.",
      "Heck, even six-time All-Star Kyle Lowry (hip strain) sat out against the Clippers, left to watch the game wearing one of those goofy, oversized Philadelphia Eagles hats.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not ideal and not that easy to manage,\u201d coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cBut it is part of the game. Guys come and go all the time. There\u2019s guys in and out, both sides of the ball. Again, I\u2019m always disappointed for the player.\u201d",
      "The public address announcer ran down the injury report \u2014 \u201cJoel Embiid, Paul George and Kyle Lowry are out\u201d \u2014 to a muted response from 76ers fans accustomed to sitting stars. If these walls could shrug.",
      "It\u2019s easy for Sixers fans \u2014 and the front office \u2014 to wonder what could have been the franchise\u2019s ceiling had Simmons or Harden stayed happy and healthy while they teamed with Embiid.",
      "George was just the latest star expected to help Embiid chase the 76ers\u2019 first championship since 1983. Yet, the early returns have been dismal. George has played in just eight of 16 games; Embiid only four.",
      "Without them, the 76ers fell to 3-13 following a 125-99 loss to the Clippers.",
      "Embiid, wearing an all-blue 76ers sweatshirt and sweatpants, shared a few quiet conversations with his teammates in the locker room.",
      "\u201cKept trying to keep his spirits high,\u201d All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey said. \u201cHe loves basketball. He wants to play basketball every single day. If he could play all 82 games, every single game of the playoffs, I promise you, he would.\u201d",
      "He doesn't, so Nurse, in his second season, does what he can and trotted out a starting lineup that included Kelly Oubre Jr. and Guerschon Yabusele in front of a crowd dotted with empty seats.",
      "The good news, Nurse said Embiid and George were both \u201cprogressing OK.\u201d George, the nine-time All-Star, got in some work on the court on Saturday. Nurse said Embiid\u2019s swelling was \u201clooking better\u201d ahead of more exams this week.",
      "Embiid\u2019s season was a disaster since training camp. The 30-year-old Embiid skipped the entire preseason, was suspended for scuffling with a columnist, called out by teammates in a closed-door team meeting and has fallen out of favor with fans that have tired of his will-he-or-won\u2019t-he-play melodrama.",
      "\u201cAs things go up and down, we\u2019re all trying to keep things level,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI think he has kept things pretty level. He\u2019s been very communicative and seems to be OK. He understands that we\u2019re trying to figure this out as we go here. He also understands the team\u2019s not getting good results. So there is a lot to talk about.\u201d",
      "Clippers coach Tyronn Lue was an assistant coach on the U.S. team that won gold in Paris and declined to enter the fray over Embiid's health at the Olympics.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if he was supposed to be healthy or not,\u201d Lue said. \u201cHe helped us win a gold medal, it\u2019s all I know.\u201d",
      "At least the Sixers announced Friday night that Embiid would miss the Clippers\u2019 game, allowing fans to try and dump a pair of tickets on the secondary market for the price of a couple of coffeehouse chain drinks.",
      "Of note, rookie Jared McCain has about been worth the price of admission on those discount ducats.",
      "The Clippers, coming off a 4-0 homestand, played without Kawhi Leonard and other teams missing their All-Stars for reasons both fishy and fair are the norm around the league.",
      "The 76ers have no choice \u2014 much as they have since Embiid was drafted in 2014 \u2014 but to find a way around the absences.",

      "Bo Nix passed for 273 yards and had two touchdown passes to break the team's rookie record Sunday, and Denver beat the reeling Raiders 29-19.",
      "The Broncos (7-5) took another step toward an unexpected playoff spot with their second victory in a row.",
      "\u201cA year ago, we don't win that game,\u201d Broncos coach Sean Payton said. \u201cIt wasn't our best, but it was good enough. We're on to the next one, so we have a lot to clean up, but it was good to handle these guys for a second time.\u201d",
      "The Broncos won the first meeting 34-18 in Denver on Oct. 6 to end an eight-game losing streak to the Raiders.",
      "Las Vegas (2-9) has lost seven consecutive games, its longest skid since the 2017-18 seasons.",
      "\u201cI never doubt the mindset of everybody in that locker room,\u201d Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby said. \u201cEverybody shows up every day with the mindset to get better, so that's all you can ask for.\u201d",
      "Nix finished 25 of 42, and his 18-yard touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton in the third quarter broke the club rookie record of 14 TD passes set by Marlin Briscoe in 1968. Nix and Sutton later hooked up for a 2-yard TD with 5:30 left to give the Broncos a two-possession lead.",
      "Those plays helped erase a 13-9 halftime deficit. The Broncos outscored Las Vegas 20-6 in the second half after adjusting to the Raiders' willingness to repeatedly bring more pressure than anticipated.",
      "\u201cWe had to shift that mindset,\u201d Nix said. \u201cWe went into the game expecting (some). We had some calls for it, so now we had to get to those and adjust to them. I thought we did a good job handling the pressure, getting some more 1-on-1s.\u201d",
      "Denver lost its previous four games at Allegiant Stadium. This also was the Broncos' first road win in this series since defeating the then-Oakland Raiders on Oct. 11, 2015.",
      "\u201cI think the tide is turning,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cThe Broncos are in a spot where we want to be back in the AFC West, and I think that's a really exciting spot to be in. Job's not finished.\u201d",
      "Sutton caught eight passes for 97 yards and two touchdowns to extend his streak of 70-yard games to five. That's the longest streak by a Broncos player since Demaryius Thomas' eight straight in 2014.",
      "Raiders quarterback Gardner Minshew landed hard on his left shoulder late in the game and was replaced by Desmond Ridder. Minshew will miss the rest of the season with a broken collarbone, according to multiple reports.",
      "Minshew completed 25 of 42 passes for 230 yards, with a touchdown and interception. The best passing play, however, came on a fake punt when AJ Cole completed a 34-yard pass to linebacker Divine Deablo to set up a second-quarter field goal.",
      "That was one of four field goals by Daniel Carlson, whose duel with Broncos counterpart Will Lutz kept Las Vegas in the game. They combined to make all nine of their attempts, including three from more than 50 yards.",
      "Jakobi Meyers caught 10 passes for 121 yards. That\u2019s his best game since 2020, when Meyers played for the New England Patriots and caught 12 passes for 169 yards against the New York Jets.",
      "Crosby recorded his 100th tackle for loss in the second quarter, becoming the fourth player to reach that number since at least 1999 in his first six seasons. The others were J.J. Watt, Aaron Donald and DeMarcus Ware.",
      "The Raiders are a shell of themselves. They played this game without their top two running backs as well as two starters at cornerback, two on the defensive line and one at safety.",
      "\u201cCredit Vegas,\u201d Payton said. \u201cThey came out and had some fire about them, but they lost.\u201d",
      "Raiders special teams coordinator Tom McMahon did not coach, but no reason was provided. Derius Swinton II handled those duties.",

      "Saquon Barkley ran for touchdowns of 70 and 72 yards in the second half and finished with an Eagles-record 255 yards rushing in the streaking Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 seventh consecutive victory, 37-20 over the Los Angeles Rams",
      "INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- When Saquon Barkley glanced up at a SoFi Stadium replay of his latest huge run for the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night, he happened to see a graphic indicating he had 173 yards rushing \u2014 only 16 shy of what he knew to be his career high.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Aw, I wish I never saw that,'\" Barkley said with a grin. \u201cThat's just the devil talking, that's how I look at it. ... I'm a big believer that if it happens, it happens. Just let it come to you.\u201d",
      "Barkley decided to continue to run for his teammates, not for records. A few carries later, both his personal best and several additional superlatives fell right to him with his second massive touchdown run on a historic night.",
      "Barkley ran for scores of 70 and 72 yards in the second half and finished with an Eagles-record 255 yards rushing in Philadelphia\u2019s seventh consecutive victory, 37-20 over the Los Angeles Rams.",
      "Barkley racked up the ninth-most yards rushing in a game in NFL history largely thanks to his huge TD runs bookending the second half. He sprinted for a 70-yard score on the opening snap of the third quarter, and he added another huge run up the middle with 2:44 to play.",
      "\u201cSaquon has that ability to hit home runs, and so sometimes that\u2019s how it goes,\u201d Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. \"You get some short gain, short gain, short gain \u2014 boom, home run. Saquon is that type of player, and our offensive line did a good job of handling the variations of the front.\u201d",
      "Barkley had 302 total yards \u2014 becoming the 12th player in NFL history to top 300, and the first Eagles player \u2014 while also becoming the first NFL player with two 70-yard TD runs in a game since Maurice Jones-Drew in 2009.",
      "Barkley leads the league with a career-best 1,392 yards rushing, including a league-best seven 100-yard rushing games in his seismic first season with Philadelphia after six frustrating years with the Giants.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not surprised,\u201d said Barkley, a two-time Pro Bowl selection. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I would have this much success, (but) I\u2019m thankful to be here. I\u2019m thankful for the fresh start. A big reason why I wanted to come here (is) I felt like this is a spot where I could rewrite my story and show everyone the type of player that I feel like I can be and was meant to be, and it\u2019s working out right now.\u201d",
      "While averaging 9.8 yards per carry, Barkley obliterated the Eagles franchise records of 217 yards rushing by LeSean McCoy in 2013 and 296 total yards by Duce Staley in 2000. He also had the biggest rushing performance ever against the Rams, exceeding DeMarco Murray's 253 yards for Dallas in 2011.",
      "A.J. Brown caught six passes for 109 yards and a TD from Jalen Hurts, who threw for 179 yards while NFC East-leading Philadelphia (9-2) surged in a 24-point second half.",
      "Kyren Williams rushed for a score and Demarcus Robinson caught a TD pass for the Rams (5-6), who lost their second straight home game.",
      "Matthew Stafford passed for 243 yards while getting sacked five times by Philadelphia's top-ranked defense, and Los Angeles couldn't keep up with a Super Bowl contender in the second half of only its second loss in six games. Puka Nacua had nine catches for 117 yards, and Cooper Kupp caught a 27-yard touchdown pass with 1:07 to play.",
      "The Los Angeles defense gave up 480 yards, undoing several weeks of progress for a unit that also looked overmatched early in the season.",
      "\u201c(Barkley) is getting tough, hard-earned yards, and then you give him a vertical seam like he got a couple of times,\u201d McVay said. \u201cHe has the explosiveness and long speed and the ability to finish. That is what opened and blew the game up for him. He was outstanding.\u201d",
      "The Eagles improved to 4-0 against the Rams in the Los Angeles area since the franchise returned home, but they led just 13-7 at halftime despite dominating both sides of the ball in the second quarter.",
      "Barkley had a mere 73 yards rushing in the first half for Philadelphia, but he broke open the game and the Rams\u2019 defense with his deft run up the middle to start the third quarter.",
      "\u201cHe makes a cut that I didn\u2019t think anybody else could make,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cLike, he just stopped on a dime.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles answered with Robinson's short TD catch, but Kenneth Gainwell rushed for a 13-yard TD moments later, one play after Barkley's 31-yard catch-and-run on third and long.",
      "In the final minutes, Barkley found another gaping hole in the middle of Los Angeles' defense.",
      "\u201cOne of our guys got out of the gap backside,\u201d Rams nose tackle Kobie Turner said. \"Once you give that guy space to run and now he\u2019s up on the second level, he can make guys miss and has the speed to break away.\u201d",
      "Eagles: CB Darius Slay (concussion) left in the second half. ... WR DeVonta Smith (hamstring) sat out for only the third time in his four-year career. ... Afterward, 15-year veteran DE Brandon Graham said he is out for the season with a torn triceps.",
      "Rams: Starting RT Rob Havenstein (ankle) missed his third straight game, and backup Warren McClendon struggled in pass protection.",

The first was a top-10 matchup in the regular season and the second was a top-five matchup in the Pac-12 championship game. The Ducks are 19 1/2-point favorites this time, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.",
      "The Buckeyes' showdown with upstart Indiana combined with Michigan's dropoff after winning the national championship have lowered the volume on this week's meeting with the Wolverines at the Horseshoe. If Michigan beats Ohio State a fourth straight time and it keeps the Buckeyes out of the Big Ten championship game and playoff ... well, there'll be lots of noise in Columbus then.",
      "The Lone Star Showdown returns to the gridiron for the first time since 2011, when Texas and Texas A&M were in the Big 12. The Longhorns head to No. 20 Texas A&M on a four-game win streak. The Aggies have lost two of three after Saturday's four-overtime loss at Auburn. The winner advances to the Southeastern Conference championship game against Georgia.",
      "The Broncos are tied with Notre Dame for the second-longest active win streak, at nine games, and they seem to have adopted a survive-and-advance mantra. They trailed 23-point underdog Wyoming in the fourth quarter before winning 17-13 and clincing a spot in the Mountain West championship game. They won their previous game 42-21 against San Jose State but didn't pull away until the fourth quarter. Two weeks ago they beat a three-win Nevada team 28-21.",
      "Just when you think Illinois is about to cash in for the season, they do what they did against Rutgers. The Illini were down 31-30 when they lined up for a 58-yard field goal with 14 seconds left. Ethan Moczulski missed. But wait. Rutgers called timeout before the snap, and Bret Bielema thought better of trying another kick and sent his offense back on the field. Luke Altmyer passed to Pat Bryant for the winning 40-yard touchdown. The Illini won't play for the Big Ten title, but they have a chance for nine wins and a nice bowl.",
      "Ohio State played in three of the five regular-season top-five matchups and won three of them. The Buckeyes lost to Oregon and beat Penn State and Indiana. ... Kansas' 37-21 win over Colorado made the Jayhawks the first FBS team with a losing record to beat three straight Top 25 opponents. The Jayhawks, who were 2-6 a month ago, will be bowl eligible if they win at Baylor. ... Nebraska ended the longest power conference bowl drought with its 44-25 win over Wisconsin.

League title games give the nation's top contenders a chance to hang a banner and impress the CFP committee, but more than ever, the bragging rights come with the risk of a season-wrecking loss \u2014 even with an expanded field.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a quality conversation,\u201d Georgia coach Kirby Smart said last week, sticking with the time-honored cliche of looking no further than the next weekend's opponent.",

      "That year, Alabama had one loss (to Auburn) and didn't play in the SEC title game, but made the four-team field ahead of Wisconsin, which was 12-1 after a loss to Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game. Ohio State didn't make it either \u2014 two losses didn't get teams into a four-team field. Neither did undefeated UCF.",

      "\u2014 The Atlantic Coast Conference could get multiple bids. Miami (10-1), SMU (10-1) and Clemson (9-2) all finished in the top 12 of this week's AP poll. They were cheering the loudest when both Alabama and Ole Miss suffered their third losses of the season.",

      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Google, already facing a possible breakup of the company over its ubiquitous search engine, is fighting to beat back another attack by the U.S. Department of Justice alleging monopolistic conduct, this time over technology that puts online advertising in front of consumers.",
      "The Justice Department and Google made closing arguments Monday in a trial alleging Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, will decide the case and is expected to issue a written ruling by the end of the year. If Brinkema finds Google has engaged in illegal, monopolistic conduct, she will then hold further hearings to explore what remedies should be imposed.",
      "The Justice Department, along with a coalition of states, has already said it believes Google should be forced to sell off parts of its ad tech business, which generates tens of billions of dollars annually for the Mountain View, California-based company.",
      "After roughly a month of trial testimony earlier this year, the arguments in the case remain the same.",
      "During three hours of arguments Monday, Brinkema, who sometimes tips her hand during legal arguments, did little to indicate how she might rule. She did, though, question the applicability of a key antitrust case Google cites in its defense.",
      "The Justice Department contends Google built and maintained a monopoly in \u201copen-web display advertising,\u201d essentially the rectangular ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of the page when one browses websites.",
      "Google dominates all facets of the market. A technology called DoubleClick is used pervasively by news sites and other online publishers, while Google Ads maintains a cache of advertisers large and small looking to place their ads on the right webpage in front of the right consumer.",
      "In between is another Google product, AdExchange, that conducts nearly instantaneous auctions matching advertisers to publishers.",
      "In court papers, Justice Department lawyers say Google \u201cis more concerned with acquiring and preserving its trifecta of monopolies than serving its own publisher and advertiser customers or winning on the merits.\u201d",
      "As a result, content providers and news organizations have never been able to generate the online revenue they should due to Google\u2019s excessive fees for brokering transactions between advertisers and publishers, the government says.",
      "Google argues the government's case improperly focuses on a narrow niche of online advertising. If one looks more broadly at online advertising to include social media, streaming TV services, and app-based advertising, Google says it controls as little as 10% of the market, a share that is dwindling as it faces increased and evolving competition.",
      "Google alleges in court papers that the government\u2019s lawsuit \u201cboil(s) down to the persistent complaints of a handful of Google\u2019s rivals and several mammoth publishers.\u201d",
      "Google also says it has invested billions in technology that facilitates the efficient match of advertisers to interested consumers and it should not be forced to share its technology and success with competitors.",
      "\u201cRequiring a company to do further engineering work to make its technology and customers accessible by all of its competitors on their preferred terms has never been compelled by U.S. antitrust law,\u201d the company wrote.",
      "Brinkema, during Monday's arguments, also sought clarity on Google\u2019s market share, a number the two sides dispute, depending on how broadly the market is defined.",
      "Historically, courts have been unwilling to declare an illegal monopoly in markets in which a company holds less than a 70% market share. Google says that when online display advertising is viewed as a whole, it holds only a 10% market share, and dwindling.",
      "The Justice Department contends, though, that when focusing on open-web display advertising, Google controls 91% of the market for publisher ad servers and 87% of the market for advertiser ad networks.",
      "Google says that the \u201copen web display advertising\u201d market is gerrymandered by the Justice Department to make Google look bad, and that nobody in the industry looks at that category of ads without considering the ability of advertisers to switch to other forms of advertising, like in mobile apps.",
      "The Justice Department also contends that the public is harmed by the excessive rates Google charges to facilitate ad purchases, saying the company takes 36 cents on the dollar when it facilitates the transaction end to end.",
      "Google says its \u201ctake rate\u201d has dropped to 31% and continues to decrease, and it says that rate is lower than that of its competitors.",
      "\u201cWhen you have an integrated system, one of the benefits is lower prices,\" Google lawyer Karen Dunn said Monday.",
      "The Virginia case is separate from an ongoing lawsuit brought against Google in the District of Columbia over its namesake search engine. In that case, the judge determined it constitutes an illegal monopoly but has not decided what remedy to impose.",
      "The Justice Department said last week it will seek to force Google to sell its Chrome web browser, among a host of other penalties. Google has said the department's request is overkill and unhinged from legitimate regulation.",
      "In Monday's arguments, Justice Department lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum cited the search engine case when he highlighted an email from a Google executive, David Rosenblatt, who said in a 2009 email that Google\u2019s goal was to \u201cdo to display what Google did to search,\" which Teitelbaum said showed the company's intent to achieve market dominance.",
      "\u201cGoogle did not achieve its trifecta of monopolies by accident,\u201d Teitelbaum said."

      "An advocate for major social media platforms has told Australia's Parliament that a plan to ban children younger than 16 from the sites should be delayed rather than being rushed to approval this week",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An advocate for major social media platforms told an Australian Senate committee Monday that laws to ban children younger than 16 from the sites should be delayed until next year at least instead of being rushed through the Parliament this week.",
      "Sunita Bose, managing director of Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia including X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, was answering questions at a single-day Senate committee hearing into world-first legislation that was introduced into the Parliament last week.",
      "Bose said the Parliament should wait until the government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies is completed in June.",
      "\u201cParliament is asked to pass a bill this week without knowing how it will work,\u201d Bose said.",
      "The legislation would impose fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) on platforms for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "It seems likely to be passed by Parliament by Thursday with the support of the major parties.",
      "It would take effect a year after the bill becomes law, allowing the platforms time to work out technological solutions that would also protect users\u2019 privacy.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said she looked forward to reading the Senate committee's assessment of the proposed law, which \u201csupports parents to say \u2018no\u2019\u201d to children wanting to use social media.",
      "\u201cSocial media in its current form is not a safe product for them,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cAccess to social media does not have to be the defining feature of growing up. There is more to life than constant notifications, endless scrolling and pressure to conform to the false and unrealistic perfectionism that can be served up by influencers,\u201d she added.",
      "Bose received heated questions from several senators and challenges to the accuracy of her answers.",
      "Opposition Sen. Ross Cadell asked how his 10-year-old stepson was able to hold Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube accounts from the age of 8, despite the platforms setting a nominal age limit of 13.",
      "Bose replied that \u201cthis is an area where the industry needs to improve.\u201d",
      "She said the proposed social media ban risked isolating some children and driving children to \u201cdarker, less safe online spaces\u201d than mainstream platforms.",
      "Bose said her concern with the proposed law was that \u201cthis could compromise the safety of young people,\u201d prompting a hostile response from opposition Sen. Sarah Henderson.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s an outrageous statement. You\u2019re trying to protect the big tech giants,\u201d Henderson said.",
      "Unaligned Sen. Jacqui Lambie asked why the platforms didn\u2019t use their algorithms to prevent harmful material being directed to children. The algorithms have been accused of keeping technology-addicted children connected to platforms and of flooding users with harmful material that promotes suicide and eating disorders.",
      "\u201cYour platforms have the ability to do that. The only thing that\u2019s stopping them is themselves and their greed,\u201d Lambie said.",
      "Bose said algorithms were already in place to protect young people online through functions including filtering out nudity.",
      "\u201cWe need to see continued investment in algorithms and ensuring that they do a better job at addressing harmful content,\u201d Bose said.",
      "Questioned by opposition Sen. Dave Sharma, Bose said she didn\u2019t know how much advertising revenue the platforms she represented made from Australian children.",
      "She said she was not familiar with research by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health that found X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat made $11 billion in advertising from U.S. users under 18 in 2022.",
      "Communications department official Sarah Vandenbroek told the committee the evaluation of age assurance technologies that will report in June would assess not only their accuracy but also their security and privacy settings.",
      "Department Deputy Secretary James Chisholm said officials had consulted widely before proposing the age limit.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s a good idea and it can be done,\u201d Chisholm told the committee."

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Biden administration plans on reducing part of Intel's $8.5 billion in federal funding for computer chip plants around the country, according to three people familiar with the grant who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.",
      "The reduction is largely a byproduct of the $3 billion that Intel is also receiving to provide computer chips to the military. President Joe Biden announced the agreement to provide Intel with up to $8.5 billion in direct funding and $11 billion in loans in March.",
      "The changes to Intel\u2019s funding are not related to the company\u2019s financial record or milestones, the people familiar with the grant told The Associated Press. In August, the chipmaker announced that it would cut 15% of its workforce \u2014 about 15,000 jobs \u2014 in an attempt to turn its business around to compete with more successful rivals like Nvidia and AMD.",
      "Unlike some of its rivals, Intel manufactures chips in addition to designing them.",
      "Two years ago, President Biden hailed Intel as a job creator with its plans to open a new plant near Columbus, Ohio. The president praised the company for plans to \u201cbuild a workforce of the future\u201d for the $20 billion project, which he said would generate 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full-time jobs set to pay an average of $135,000 a year.",
      "The California-based tech giant's funding is tied to a sweeping 2022 law that President Biden has celebrated and which is designed to revive U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. Known as the CHIPS and Science Act, the $280 billion package is aimed at sharpening the U.S. edge in military technology and manufacturing while minimizing the kinds of supply disruptions that occurred in 2021, after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when a shortage of chips stalled factory assembly lines and fueled inflation.",
      "The Biden administration helped shepherd the legislation following pandemic-era concerns that the loss of access to chips made in Asia could plunge the U.S. economy into recession. When pushing for the investment, lawmakers expressed concern about efforts by China to control Taiwan, which accounts for more than 90% of advanced computer chip production.",
      "In August, the administration pledged to provide up to $6.6 billion so that a Taiwanese semiconductor giant could expand the facilities it is already building in Arizona and better ensure that the most advanced microchips are produced domestically for the first time. The Commerce Department said the funding for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. meant the company could expand on its existing plans for two facilities in Phoenix and add a third, newly announced production hub.",
      "The administration has promised tens of billions of dollars to support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness.",

      "\u201cI have the best health professionals helping me to make a recovery. I will be back as soon as I can. Please be patient and pray for my family and I,\u201d the post said.",
      "Dotcom\u2019s U.S.-based lawyer, Ira Rothken, confirmed to The Associated Press that the contents of the statement were accurate. Rothken would not say whether Dotcom or someone else wrote the post and did not provide further details.",
      "Usually a prolific X user, the 50-year-old internet mogul last posted to the site on Nov. 6. His New Zealand-based lawyer, Ron Mansfield, told the New Zealand Herald on Tuesday that Dotcom suffered the stroke on Nov. 7 and is expected to remain hospitalized for some time. His prognosis is uncertain, Mansfield said.",
      "News of his ill health comes during a protracted battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire to the United States from New Zealand to face charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering.",
      "In August, New Zealand \u2019s justice minister announced that Dotcom should be surrendered to the United States to face trial, a ruling intended to cap a 12-year legal battle. A date for the extradition was not set, and Paul Goldsmith, the minister, said Dotcom would be allowed \u201ca short period of time to consider and take advice\u201d on the decision.",
      "Rothken at the time wrote on X that Dotcom intended to challenge the order in court through a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official\u2019s decision was reached correctly.",
      "The saga stretches to the 2012 arrest of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion, along with other company officers. Prosecutors said the once wildly popular Megaupload raked in at least $175 million \u2014 mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies \u2014 before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested had argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors argued the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "The men fought the order for years \u2014 lambasting the investigation and arrests \u2014 but in 2021 New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be extradited. It remained up to the country\u2019s Justice Minister to decide if the extradition should proceed.",
      "\u201cI love New Zealand. I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d German-born Dotcom wrote on X in August. He did not respond to an AP request for comment at the time, or on Monday.",
      "Two of Dotcom\u2019s former business partners pleaded guilty to the charges they faced and served time in a New Zealand jail, avoiding extradition to the U.S. Prosecutors abandoned an extradition bid against another, who has since died of cancer."

      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner who is set to headline the next Super Bowl halftime, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre's biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply earlier this year. The move to court, while not yet a lawsuit, still represents a major escalation of the feud and involves some of the biggest business partners of both men."

      "A Michigan State University engineering professor and undergraduate student have designed and produced a 3D-printed helmet earhole insert that helps to drown out crowd noise for some players on the school's football team",
      "EAST LANSING, Mich. -- The sight was a common one for Andrew Kolpacki. For many a Sunday, he would watch NFL games on TV and see quarterbacks putting their hands on their helmets, desperately trying to hear the play call from the sideline or booth as tens of thousands of fans screamed at the tops of their lungs.",
      "When the NCAA\u2019s playing rules oversight committee this past spring approved the use of coach-to-player helmet communications in games for the 2024 season, Kolpacki, Michigan State\u2019s head football equipment manager, knew the Spartans\u2019 QBs and linebackers were going to have a problem.",

      "Bush and Rylie DuBois, a sophomore biosystems engineering major and undergraduate research assistant at the lab, set out to produce earhole inserts made from polylactic acid, a bio-based plastic, using a 3D printer. Part of the challenge was accounting for the earhole sizes and shapes that vary depending on helmet style.",
      "Once the season got underway with a Friday night home game against Florida Atlantic on Aug. 30, the helmets of starting quarterback Aidan Chiles and linebacker Jordan Turner were outfitted with the inserts, which helped mitigate crowd noise.",

      "\u201cI felt such a strong sense of accomplishment and pride,\u201d DuBois said. \u201cAnd I told all my friends around me about how I designed what they were wearing on the field.\u201d",
      "All told, Bush and DuBois have produced around 180 sets of the inserts, a number that grew in part due to the variety of helmet designs and colors that are available to be worn by Spartan players any given Saturday. Plus, the engineering folks have been fine-tuning their design throughout the season.",
      "Dozens of Bowl Subdivision programs are doing something similar. In many cases, they\u2019re getting 3D-printed earhole covers from XO Armor Technologies, which provides on-site, on-demand 3D printing of athletic wearables.",
      "The Auburn, Alabama-based company has donated its version of the earhole covers to the equipment managers of programs ranging from Georgia and Clemson to Boise State and Arizona State in the hope the schools would consider doing business with XO Armor in the future, said Jeff Klosterman, vice president of business development.",
      "XO Armor first was approached by the Houston Texans at the end of last season about creating something to assist quarterback C.J. Stroud in better hearing play calls delivered to his helmet during road games. XO Armor worked on a solution and had completed one when it received another inquiry: Ohio State, which had heard Michigan State was moving forward with helmet inserts, wondered if XO Armor had anything in the works.",
      "\u201cWe kind of just did this as a one-off favor to the Texans and honestly didn\u2019t forecast it becoming our viral moment in college football,\u201d Klosterman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got about 60 teams across college football and the NFL wearing our sound-deadening earhole covers every weekend.\u201d",
      "The rules state that only one player for each team is permitted to be in communication with coaches while on the field. For the Spartans, it\u2019s typically Chiles on offense and Turner on defense. Turner prefers to have an insert in both earholes, but Chiles has asked that the insert be used in only one on his helmet.",
      "Chiles \u201clikes to be able to feel like he has some sort of outward exposure,\u201d Kolpacki said.",
      "Exposure is something the sophomore signal-caller from Long Beach, California, had in away games against Michigan and Oregon this season. Michigan Stadium welcomed 110,000-plus fans for the Oct. 26 matchup between the in-state rivals. And while just under 60,000 packed Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon, for the Ducks' 31-10 win over Michigan State three weeks earlier, it was plenty loud. \u201cThe Big Ten has some pretty impressive venues,\u201d Kolpacki said.",
      "\u201cIt can be just deafening,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's what those fans are there for is to create havoc and make it difficult for coaches to get a play call off.\u201d",
      "Something that is a bit easier to handle thanks to Bush and her team. She called the inserts a \u201cwin-win-win\" for everyone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me to work with athletics and the football team,\" she said. \"I think it\u2019s really exciting for our students as well to take what they\u2019ve learned and develop and design something and see it being used and executed.\u201d",

    "summary": "A federal judge in Texas has delayed a hearing in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars and turning it into a parody",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas has delayed a hearing in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars and turning it into a parody",
      "A bankruptcy judge on Monday delayed a hearing in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019 effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars, keeping the auction sale up in the air for at least another few weeks.",
      "Jones alleges fraud and collusion marred the bankruptcy auction that resulted in The Onion being named the winning bidder over a company affiliated with him. A trustee overseeing the auction denies the allegations and accuses Jones of launching a smear campaign because he didn't like the outcome.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez had been scheduled to hear an emergency motion to disqualify The Onion's bid on Monday, but put it off until either Dec. 9 or Dec. 17. That's also when the judge will hear arguments on the trustee's request to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion. Lopez said it made sense to have one hearing on both requests.",
      "\u201cI want a fair and transparent process and let\u2019s just see where the process goes,\" Lopez said.",
      "Lopez could ultimately allow The Onion to move forward with its purchase, order a new auction or name the other bidder as the winner. At stake is whether Jones gets to stay at Infowars\u2019 studio in Austin, Texas, under a new owner friendly to him, or whether he gets kicked out by The Onion.",
      "The other bidder, First United American Companies, runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements.",
      "Jones continues to broadcast his show from the Infowars studio, but he has set up a new location, websites and social media accounts as a precaution. The trustee shut down the Austin studio and Infowars' websites for about 24 hours last week after The Onion was announced as the winning bidder, but allowed them to resume the next day, drawing more complaints from Jones.",
      "Jones declared bankruptcy and liquidated his assets after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion to relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. He was ordered to pay damages for defamation and emotional distress in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas after he repeatedly said the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators was a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Proceeds from the liquidation are to go to Jones\u2019 creditors, including the Sandy Hook families who sued him.",
      "Last year, Lopez ruled that $1.1 billion of the Sandy Hook judgments could not be discharged in the bankruptcy. On Monday, he denied a request from Sandy Hook families to make the full $1.5 billion not dischargeable, meaning the debt cannot be wiped clean.",
      "Also Monday, lawyers for the social media platform X objected to any sale of the accounts of both Jones and Infowars, saying X is the owner of the accounts and it has not given consent for them to be sold or transferred. Jones' personal X account, with 3.3 million followers, was not part of the auction, but Lopez will be deciding if it should be included in the liquidation.",
      "Jones has praised X owner Elon Musk on his show and suggested that Musk should buy Infowars. Musk has not responded publicly to that suggestion and was not among the bidders.",
      "Jones was permanently banned from Twitter in 2018 for abusive behavior, but Musk restored Jones\u2019 account on the platform he has since renamed X in December last year.",
      "Jones alleges The Onion\u2019s bid was the result of fraud and collusion involving many of the Sandy Hook families, the humor site and the court-appointed trustee.",
      "First United American Companies submitted a $3.5 million sealed bid, while The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash. But The Onion's bid also included a pledge by Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, said that made The Onion's proposal better for creditors and he named it the winning bid.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies claimed that the bid violated Lopez\u2019s rules for the auction by including multiple entities and lacking a valid dollar amount. Jones also alleged Murray improperly canceled an expected round of live bidding and only selected from among the two sealed bids that were submitted.",
      "Jones called the auction \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d on his show, which airs on the Infowars website, radio stations and Jones' X account. He filed a counter lawsuit last week against Murray, The Onion's parent company and the Sandy Hook families in the bankruptcy court.",
      "In a court filing on Sunday, Murray called the allegations a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to delay the sale of Infowars to The Onion and accused Jones, his lawyers and attorneys for First United American Companies of a \u201cvicious smear campaign lobbing patently false accusations.\u201d He also alleged Jones collaborated with First United American Companies to try to buy Infowars.",
      "Lopez\u2019s September order on the auction procedures made a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "The assets of Infowars' parent company, Free Speech Systems, that were up for sale included the Austin studio, Infowars' video archive, video production equipment, product trademarks, and Infowars' websites and social media accounts. Another auction of remaining assets is set for Dec. 10.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights, but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate, guns and other belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Documents filed in court this year say Jones had about $9 million in personal assets, while Free Speech Systems had about $6 million in cash and more than $1 million worth of inventory."

      "Amazon has introduced a handful of robots in its warehouses that the e-commerce giant says will improve efficiency and reduce employee injuries",
      "Amazon has introduced a handful of robots in its warehouses that the e-commerce giant says will improve efficiency and reduce employee injuries.",
      "Two robotic arms named Robin and Cardinal can lift packages that weigh up to 50 pounds. A third, called Sparrow, picks up items from bins and puts them in other containers.",
      "Proteus, an autonomous mobile robot that operates on the floor, can move carts around a warehouse. The bipedal, humanoid robot Digit is being tested to help move empty totes with its hands. And there\u2019s also Sequoia, a containerized storage system that can present totes to employees in a way that allows them to avoid stretching or squatting to grab inventory.",
      "Amazon says Robin is currently being used in dozens of warehouses. The others are in a testing stage or haven\u2019t been rolled out widely. But the company says it's already seeing benefits, such as reducing the time it takes to fulfill orders and helping employees avoid repetitive tasks. However, automation also carries drawbacks for workers, who would have to be retrained for new positions if the robots made their roles obsolete.",
      "In October, Amazon held an event at a Nashville, Tennessee, warehouse where the company had integrated some of the robots. The Associated Press spoke with Julie Mitchell, the director of Amazon\u2019s robotic sortation technologies, about where the company hopes to go from here. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: This journey that we\u2019ve been on has taken a couple of years. Luckily for us, we\u2019ve been at this for over a decade. So we have a lot of core technology that we can build on top of. We started these particular robots - Cardinal and Proteus - in this building in November 2022. We came in and began playing around with what it would look like to pack and move a production order. Less than two years later, we are at scale and shipping 70% of the items in this building through that robotics system.",
      "A: We talk about \u201cbuild, test and scale\u201d and that\u2019s about a two-year cycle for us right now.",
      "A: As you can probably imagine, we have so many items, so it\u2019s an exceptional challenge. We rely on data and putting our first prototype in a real building, where we expose it to all the things we need it to do. Then we drive down all the reasons that it fails. We give it a lot of sample sizes in a very short period of time. For example, a couple of years ago, we launched our Robin robotics arm \u2013 a package manipulation robot \u2013 and we\u2019re at 3 billion picks. So the ability to launch into our network, rapidly collect data, scale and iterate has enabled us to go fast.",
      "The challenge itself can be boiled down to three simple things: you need to perceive the scene, plan your motion and then execute. Today, those are three different parts of our system. Artificial intelligence is going to help us change all of that, and it\u2019s going to be more outcome-driven, like asking it to pick up a bottle of water. We\u2019re on the verge, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m personally excited to be here at the onset of generative AI and use it to dramatically improve the performance of our robotics.",
      "A: With the technology we\u2019ve deployed here, we\u2019re creating new roles for individuals that can acquire new skills to fulfill those roles. And these new skills are not something that is too difficult to achieve. You don\u2019t need an engineering degree, Ph.D. or any really technical skills to support our robotics systems. We designed the systems so they\u2019re easy to service and train on the job to be a reliability maintenance engineer.",
      "We are working backwards from the idea that we want to employ more skilled labor. These opportunities are obviously higher paid than the entry level jobs in our buildings. And partnering with MIT has helped us understand what matters most to our team as we\u2019re deploying these technologies across our network.",
      "A: Not in the adoption. We\u2019re integrating it. But these are complex systems and this is the real world, so things go wrong. For example, we had bad weather due to the storms in the Southeast. When I look at the robotics systems data, I can tell the weather is bad outside because that dramatically affects how the ship dock works.",
      "When trucks don\u2019t arrive on time or when they can\u2019t leave, you see bottlenecks in the building in strange ways. Containers build up, we have to put them in different places, and then humans need to recover them. So communication between what our robotics system is doing and what we need employees in the building to do to recover is important. It's a collaboration of automation and humans to deal with real-world problems. It\u2019s not a matter of having robotics take over but making it one system of humans and robotics working together to accomplish the goal of shipping the product."

Unlike so many things that begin as memes, it transcended its online beginnings. Instead of an either-or, the two movies ultimately complemented and boosted one another at the box office.",
      "And ever since, moviegoers, marketers and meme makers have been trying to recreate that moment, searching the movie release schedule for odd mashups and sending candidates off into the social media void. Most attempts have fizzled (sorry, \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d ).",

      "Both films topped Fandango\u2019s most anticipated holiday movie survey, where 65% of respondents said that they were interested in the \u201cGlicked\u201d double feature. Theaters big and small are also pulling out the stops with movie-themed tie-ins. B&B Theaters will have Roman guards tearing tickets at some locations and Maximus popcorn tubs. Marcus Theaters is doing Oz photo ops and friendship bracelet-making. Alamo Drafthouse is leaning into the singalong aspect (beware, though, not all theaters are embracing this) and the punny drinks like \u201cDefying Gravi-Tea.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than it being in competition, I think they\u2019re in conversation,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal said. \u201cThis industry needs a shot in the arm. Those films gave it last year. We hope to do it this year.\u201d",
      "And the hope is that audiences will flock to theaters to be part of this moment as well. It's a sorely needed influx of could-be blockbusters into a marketplace that's still at an 11% deficit from last year and down 27.2% from 2019, according to data from Comscore.",
      "\u201cCompetition is good for the marketplace. It\u2019s good for consumers,\u201d said Michael O'Leary, the president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \u201cHaving two great movies coming out at the same time is simply a multiplier effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cGlicked\u201d is currently tracking for a combined North American debut in the $165 million range, with \u201cWicked\u201d forecast to earn around $100 million (up from the $80 million estimates a few weeks ago) and \u201cGladiator II\u201d pegged for the $65 million range.",

In fact, in the U.K. it played alongside \u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d where that double was pegged \u201cGladdington.\u201d \u201cGladiator\u201d reviews, while positive, are a little more divided than the others.

      "The new films also cost more than \u201cBarbie\u201d ($145 million) and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d ($100 million). According to reports, \u201cGladiator II\u201d had a $250 million price tag; \u201cWicked\u201d reportedly cost $150 million to produce (and that does not include the cost of the second film, due next year).",
      "The narrative, though, has shifted away from \u201cwho will win the weekend.\u201d Earlier this year, Chu told The Associated Press that he loves that this is a moment where \u201cwe can root for all movies all the time.\u201d",
      "Close behind are a bevy of Christmas releases with double feature potential, but those feel a little more niche. There\u2019s the remake of \u201cNosferatu,\u201d the Nicole Kidman kink pic \u201cBabygirl\u201d and the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The internet can\u2019t even seem to decide on its angle for that batch of contenders, and none exactly screams blockbuster. Sometimes the joy is just in the game, however. Some are sticking with the one-name mashup (\u201cBabyratu\u201d); others are suggesting that the fact that two of the movies feature real-life exes (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp) is enough reason for a double feature. And getting people talking is half the battle.",

      "Dominion also filed several defamation lawsuits against those who spread conspiracy theories blaming its election equipment for Donald Trump\u2019s loss in 2020. Last year, Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion in Delaware for $787 million.",
      "The shareholder plaintiffs also allege that Fox corporate leaders ignored \u201cred flags\u201d about liability arising from a 2017 report suggesting that Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, may have been killed because he had leaked Democratic party emails to Wikileaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. Rich, 27, was shot in 2016 in Washington, D.C., in what authorities have said was an attempted robbery.",
      "Fox News retracted the Seth Rich story a week after its initial broadcast, but Rich\u2019s parents sued the network for falsely portraying their son as a criminal and traitor. Fox News settled the lawsuit in 2020 for \u201cmillions of dollars,\u201d shortly before program hosts Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity were to be deposed, according to the shareholder lawsuit.",
      "Joel Friedlander, an attorney for the institutional shareholders, argued that Fox officials waited until the company\u2019s reporting about Rich became a national scandal before addressing the issue. Similarly, according to the shareholders, corporate officials, including Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, allowed Fox News to continue broadcasting false narratives about the 2020 election, despite internal communications suggesting that they knew there was no evidence to support the conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cThe Murdochs could have minimized future monetary exposure, but they chose not to,\u201d Friedlander said. Instead, he argued, they engaged in \u201cbad-faith decision making\u201d with other defendants in a profit-driven effort to retain viewers and remain in Trump\u2019s good graces.",
      "\u201cDecisions were made at the highest level to promote pro-Trump conspiracy theories without editorial control,\u201d Friedlander said.",
      "Defense attorneys argue that the case should be dismissed because the plaintiffs filed their lawsuit without first demanding that the Fox Corp. board take action, as required under Delaware law. They say the plaintiffs also failed to demonstrate that a pre-suit demand on the Fox board would have been futile because at least half of the directors face a substantial likelihood of liability or are not independent of someone who does.",
      "Beyond the \u201cdemand futility\u201d issue, defense attorneys also argue that allegations that Fox officials breached their fiduciary duties fail to meet the pleading standards under Delaware and therefore should be dismissed.",
      "Defense attorney William Savitt argued, for example, that neither the Rich settlement, which he described as \u201cimmaterial,\u201d nor the allegedly defamatory statements about Dominion and Smartmatic constitute red flags putting directors on notice about the risk of defamation liability. Nor do they demonstrate that directors acted in bad faith or that Fox \u201cutterly failed\u201d to implement and monitor a system to report and mitigate legal risks, including defamation liability risk, according to the defendants.",
      "Savitt noted that the Rich article was promptly retracted, and that the settlement included no admission of liability. The Dominion and Smartmatic statements, meanwhile, gave rise themselves to the currently liability issues and therefore can not serve as red flags about future liability risks, according to the defendants.",
      "\u201cA \u2018red flag\u2019 must be what the term commonly implies \u2014 warning of a risk of a liability-causing event that allows the directors to take action to avert the event, not notice that a liability-causing event has already occurred,\u201d defense attorneys wrote in their motion to dismiss.",
      "Defense attorneys also say there are no factual allegations to support claims that Fox officials condoned illegal conduct in pursuit of corporate profits, or that they deliberately ignored their oversight responsibilities. They note that a \u201cbad outcome\u201d is not sufficient to demonstrate \u201cbad faith.\u201d",

According to the study, the canals were used for around 1,000 years or longer, including during the \u201cformative\u201d period when the Maya began to settle in permanent farming villages and a distinctive culture started to emerge.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see such large-scale modifications of the landscape so early \u2014 it shows people were already building things,\u201d said University of Pittsburgh archaeologist Claire Ebert, who was not involved in the study.",

(Dorsey's no longer involved with Bluesky, which is owned and run by its executive team as a public benefit corporation.)",
      "If you take the plunge and get an account, you'll need a username. You'll notice Bluesky handles are a little bit different because they end by default in the site's domain, .bsky.social.",

      "\u201cOur online experience doesn\u2019t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see,\u201d it says.",
      "What it means is that you can follow custom feeds set up by other users, or design your own. If you tap #Feeds in the menu on the left, you'll see some default offerings like Cat Pics and Gardening. My Bangers is a list of your most popular posts by likes and Catch Up shows the site's most popular posts from the past 24 hours. You can find more by doing a search and tapping the Feeds button.",
      "There's also the usual \u201cDiscover\u201d feed of suggested posts and a chronological feed of accounts that you follow.",
      "To help new users settle in, Bluesky has starter packs of recommended feeds and accounts to follow, which anyone can create and share. They don\u2019t show up in Bluesky's search results but can be found in directories online.",
      "Or someone might share one with you. After I signed up, a colleague pointed me to one for major news outlets. There are tens of thousands of starter packs, ranging from broadly appealing topics like Taylor Swift to niche interests like cargo bikes or U.K. comedians.

      "\"This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country! Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power, and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price.\" Trump posted.",
      "In another post, Trump said that he will be charging China with an additional 10% tariff on top of any additional tariffs on products coming into the U.S., arguing the country wasn't doing enough to stop the flow of illicit drugs.",
      "\"Representatives of China told me that they would institute their maximum penalty, that of death, for any drug dealers caught doing this but, unfortunately, they never followed through, and drugs are pouring into our Country, mostly through Mexico, at levels never seen before,\" Trump claimed.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump proposed tariffs of between 60% and 100% on Chinese goods, and a tax of between 10% and 20% on every product imported from all U.S. trading partners.",
      "On the day before the election, Trump told a rally in Pittsburgh, \"I'm putting tariffs on Mexico. Every damn thing that they sell into the United States has got to have like a 25% tariff until they stop drugs from coming in.\"",
      "Economists widely forecast that tariffs of this magnitude would increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers.",
      "Trump's tariffs would cost the average U.S. household about $2,600 per year, according to an estimate from the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Raymond Robertson, professor for trade, economics and public policy at Texas A&M University, told ABC News Trump's plan will not be as effective because countries know what's coming.",

      "Robertson added that countries know this would be \"disruptive\" and a \"disaster,\" but they've \"seen how this game works.\" Robertson says our trading partners could seek closer ties to Europe and other countries and rely less on the U.S., \"which means higher prices for us.\"",

      "Epshteyn allegedly sought payment from those interested in administration spots.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump directed his top advisers to conduct an internal investigation into alleged claims of impropriety by his top legal adviser Boris Epshteyn, multiple sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "The allegations from top allies of the president-elect and individuals close to his transition team claimed that Epshteyn used his position of proximity to Trump to seek financial compensation, claiming he could potentially secure positions for certain individuals in the administration.",
      "An internal investigation conducted by lawyers for Trump preliminarily found a pattern of behavior with Epshteyn that was concerning, sources said.",
      "The review allegedly found that Epshteyn would offer access to Trump in exchange for monthly consulting fees. The review by Trump's lawyers concluded that Epshteyn's alleged conduct should result in termination of his employment and proximity to Trump.",
      "It's not clear if the report was ever delivered to Trump and as of Monday evening Epshteyn still appeared to be employed by Trump.",
      "\"I am honored to work for President Trump and with his team,\" Epshteyn told ABC News. \"These fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from Making America Great Again.\"",
      "The internal investigation was first reported by CNN.",
      "In a sworn declaration submitted to Trump's transition team and obtained by ABC News, former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens said that he contacted Epshteyn following the election to mention his interest in serving in Trump's administration, and -- despite the absence of an explicit offer -- Greitens said that Epshteyn's \"comments and demeanor suggested that he might entertain offering a position in the administration in exchange for financial consideration, but such an offer would happen in subsequent discussion.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the review by Trump's lawyers found that the day after Trump met with Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent for the first time in February, Epshteyn invited him to lunch and asked Bessent for a monthly stipend of at least $30,000 to promote Bessent around Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club.",

    "summary": "A judge has dismissed Donald Trump's election interference case after Jack Smith asked her to toss the case due to a DOJ policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.",
    "story": [
      "The judge left open the highly unlikely possibility of a future prosecution.",
      "The judge overseeing Donald Trump's election interference case dismissed the case Monday, after special counsel Jack Smith asked the judge to toss the case due to a long-standing Justice Department policy that bars the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Smith earlier Monday filed a motion to dismiss the case, as well as the appeal of Trump's classified documents case, ahead of Trump's impending inauguration, due to the DOJ's presidential immunity policy and not because the charges lacked merit.",
      "Smith also asked the judge in Trump's classified documents case that his appeal against Trump's two co-defendants in that case, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, be allowed to continue.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan dismissed the election interference charges against Trump without prejudice, leaving open the highly unlikely possibility of a future prosecution.",
      "In a two-page opinion, Judge Chutkan wrote that dismissing the case without prejudice is \"appropriate\" and would not harm the \"public interest,\" agreeing with Smith's argument that Trump's immunity would not cover him when he leaves office.",
      "\"Dismissal without prejudice is also consistent with the Government's understanding that the immunity afforded to a sitting President is temporary, expiring when they leave office,\" Chutkan wrote.",
      "However, it's extremely unlikely that any prosecutor would attempt to bring the same charges in the future, in part because the statute of limitations for the alleged crimes will have expired by the time Trump leaves office in four years.",
      "Trump's lawyers did not oppose the government's motion to dismiss the case without prejudice.",
      "\"That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Government stands fully behind,\" Smith stated in his motion to dismiss.",
      "\"The country have never faced the circumstance here, where a federal indictment against a private citizen has been returned by a grand jury and a criminal prosecution is already underway when the defendant is elected President,\" the motion said. \"After careful consideration, the Department has determined that OLC's prior opinions concerning the Constitution's prohibition on federal indictment and prosecution of a sitting President apply to this situation and that as a result this prosecution must be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\"",
      "Smith moved to dismiss his appeal of the charges against Trump in his classified documents case, in which Trump pleaded not guilty last year to 40 criminal counts related to his handling of classified materials after leaving the White House, after U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case in July over her finding that Smith was improperly appointed to his role. Smith appealed that ruling to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that legal precedent and history confirm the attorney general's ability to appoint special counsels.",
      "Monday's filing asks the court to dismiss that appeal -- but it seeks to keep the appeal in place for Nauta and De Oliveira, two Trump employees who pleaded not guilty to obstruction charges.",
      "\"The appeal concerning the other two defendants will continue because, unlike defendant Trump, no principle of temporary immunity applies to them,\" the filing said.",
      "In a statement, John Irving, a lawyer for De Oliveira, said, \"The Special Counsel's decision to proceed in this case even after dismissing it against President Trump is an unsurprising tribute to the poor judgment that led to the indictment against Mr. De Oliveira in the first place. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. If they prefer a slow acquittal, that's fine with us.\"",
      "Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung, in a statement, called Smith's motions to dismiss a \"major victory for the rule of law\" and said, \"The American People and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.\"",
      "In the election interference case, Trump last year pleaded not guilty to federal charges of undertaking a \"criminal scheme\" to overturn the results of the 2020 election by enlisting a slate of so-called \"fake electors,\" using the Justice Department to conduct \"sham election crime investigations,\" trying to enlist the vice president to \"alter the election results,\" and promoting false claims of a stolen election during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, all in an effort to subvert democracy and remain in power.",
      "Smith subsequently charged Trump in a superseding indictment that was adjusted to respect the Supreme Court's July ruling that Trump is entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts undertaken as president.",
      "Earlier this month, Judge Chutkan canceled the remaining deadlines in the election interference case after Smith requested time to \"assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy\" following Trump's election.",
      "Judge Chutkan had been in the process of considering how the case should proceed in light of the Supreme Court's immunity ruling.",
      "Smith had faced filing deadlines of Dec. 2 for both the election interference case and the classified documents case, after Smith's team requested more time to determine how to face the unprecedented situation of pending federal cases against someone who had just been elected to the presidency.",
      "Getting Monday's filings in a week ahead of schedule now raises the question of whether Smith will be able to beat the clock to officially close his office down and submit his final report to Attorney General Merrick Garland -- as is required of him per the DOJ's special counsel regulations -- before Inauguration Day, which is Jan. 20.",
      "The final report will have to go through a classification review by the intelligence community, a process that can sometimes take weeks before it is approved for any kind of public release.",
      "Garland has made clear in appearances before Congress and in public statements that he is committed to making public the final reports of all special counsels during his tenure, which to date has included reports by special counsel Robert Hur following his probe of President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents before assuming the presidency, and by special counsel John Durham following his probe of the 2016 Russia investigation.",
      "Special counsel David Weiss is still continuing his investigation of FBI informant Alexander Smirnov, who pleaded not guilty to charges of lying about President Biden and his son Hunter Biden, and is set to take the case to trial in California next week. It's unclear whether Weiss will formally close his investigation down and submit a final report prior to Trump taking office.",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 14:22:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., a prominent ally of Donald Trump, said the president-elect would fire members of his Cabinet who don't follow the policy he sets out.",
    "story": [
      "Trump will command compliance from his administration, GOP senator says.",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., a prominent ally of Donald Trump, said voters don't care who conducts background checks into the president-elect's Cabinet picks and that Trump would fire members of his administration who don't follow the policy he sets out.",
      "In an interview with \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl, Hagerty lambasted the records of some of President Joe Biden's Cabinet members and insisted that Trump will command compliance from top members of his upcoming administration.",
      "Name-checking Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for the bloody withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, Hagerty said, \u201cThey've not been held to account.\u201d",
      "\"President Trump will fire people that don't do their job well. I fully expect everybody coming into the Cabinet will listen to President Trump. They'll let him set the policy, and they'll execute according to that plan.\"",
      "Trump has moved at a rapid pace to flesh out his Cabinet, including picking Fox News host and Army veteran Pete Hegseth to lead the Pentagon, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii to be director of national intelligence and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Trump also tapped former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to head the Justice Department after former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., withdrew from consideration amid a tumultuous sexual misconduct investigation in the House Ethics Committee.",
      "Hagerty said Trump hopes to have his Cabinet nominees swiftly confirmed, telling Karl that Trump \"clearly expects to hit the ground running\" and \"wants us to have these hearings done quickly and expeditiously.\"",
      "However, others besides Gaetz have been hit with scandal.",
      "Kennedy has been a prominent vaccine skeptic and supported abortion access, riling anti-abortion groups allied with Trump. Gabbard has blamed the U.S. and NATO for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and met with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. And Hegseth is mired in a sexual misconduct controversy over payments to a woman who alleges he assaulted her at a conference.",
      "With Gaetz out of the running, the spotlight has mostly shifted to Hegseth, who has also ruffled feathers by saying that he doesn't agree that women should serve in combat roles in the military.",
      "Hagerty praised Hegseth and insisted that the Trump transition team has thoroughly vetted all of its candidates -- but that he isn't concerned with who does a formal background check on them before the confirmation process formally begins.",
      "\"Don't let these allegations distract us. What we need is real significant change. The Pentagon has been more focused on pronouns than they have lethality the past four years. We need to get back to business, and I think Pete is just the person to do it,\" Hagerty said.",
      "\"The transition team has been working for months to prepare for this. I'm certain that there was significant vetting that has taken place, it has for every candidate,\" Hagerty added.",
      "FBI background checks have been standard practice for nominees requiring Senate confirmation, but the Trump transition team has yet to sign the necessary agreements to allow such screenings to occur.",
      "However, while some Republican senators have said they'd like to see an FBI background check done on Hegseth, Hagerty said, \"I don't think the American public cares who does the background checks. What the American public cares about is to see the mandate that they voted in delivered upon.\"",
      "Hagerty also said that he supports the use of recess appointments -- allowing Trump to temporarily put Cabinet picks in office while Congress is out of session -- though he did demur when pressed by Karl over whether Trump would do so if the person lacked sufficient Republican support to be confirmed in the Senate.",
      "\"I haven't spoken with President Trump about the specific plans. What he wants to do is see these appointments made quickly. He wants to see us get through the confirmation process. And again, I think everything should be on the table,\" he said.",

    "title": "Trump picks Johns Hopkins surgeon who argued against COVID lockdowns to lead FDA",
    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 17:05:38 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump picks Johns Hopkins surgeon Marty Makary, who argued against pandemic lockdowns, to lead the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
    "story": [
      "Marty Makary became a GOP favorite for his questioning of COVID restrictions.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump said he wants Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon and author who argued against pandemic lockdowns, to lead the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "\"He will work under the leadership of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to, among other things, properly evaluate harmful chemicals poisoning our Nation\u2019s food supply and drugs and biologics being given to our Nation\u2019s youth, so that we can finally address the Childhood Chronic Disease Epidemic,\" Trump said in his announcement.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Makary's job would be to oversee the FDA's $7 billion budget and report to the health secretary. The agency oversees $3.6 trillion in food, tobacco and medical products, including some 20,000 prescription drugs on the market.",
      "Here are three things to know about Makary:",
      "Makary is a respected transplant surgeon who questioned his colleagues' recommendations on COVID",
      "Makary was known during the pandemic as an experienced medical expert willing to challenge his colleagues' assumptions on COVID, although he was often criticized by his peers for cherry-picking data or omitting context.",
      "He frequently appeared on Fox News and wrote opinion articles that questioned the value of lockdowns and masks for children. He supported the use of vaccines but opposed mandates and doubted the utility of boosters, at odds with full-throated recommendations on boosters from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Among his views was that the U.S. government was underestimating the number of people who were likely immune to the virus. In early 2021, he predicted much of the country would reach \"herd immunity\" by that April, reducing risk of the virus dramatically.",
      "That assumption, however, did not happen.",
      "As restrictions eased and a new variant surfaced, virus-related deaths soared from about 4,000 a week to about 15,000 a week by September, making 2021 a deadlier year than when the pandemic began.",
      "Makary stood by his assertion that \"natural immunity\" was still being underestimated by the U.S. government.",
      "\"One reason public health officials may be afraid to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity is that they fear it will lead some to choose getting the infection over vaccination. That's a legitimate concern. But we can encourage all Americans to get vaccinated while still being honest about the data,\" he wrote a separate opinion article in The Washington Post.",
      "He sounds a lot like RFK Jr. when talking about the 'poisoned' food supply, pesticides and ultra-processed foods.",
      "After the pandemic, Makary began turning back to his initial focus railing against an overpriced health care system. He's long argued that the system is broken, overcharging patients and running unnecessary tests.",
      "He also began speaking more critically about America's food system, echoing a message embraced by Trump's pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "\"We've got a poisoned food supply. We've got pesticides. We've got ultra-processed foods and all sorts of things that have been in the blind spots in modern medicine,\" Makary told Fox News this September.",
      "Kennedy also would require Senate confirmation to get the job.",
      "In a later interview, Makary praised Trump's decision to pick Kennedy.",
      "\"He wants to address corruption in health care and corruption in our government health agencies,\" he said.",
      "He warns against 'drugging our nation's children.'",
      "It's not clear exactly what Makary would do if confirmed as FDA commissioner, as much of his work would likely be steered by Trump and the incoming health secretary, possibly Kennedy.",
      "But Makary has previously suggested an overhaul of FDA's \"erratic\" bureaucracy, which he says was too eager to approve opioids and too cautious when it came to other drugs like the COVID antiviral pill Molnupiravir.",
      "\"For too long, FDA leaders have acted like a crusty librarian who gets annoyed when someone wants to borrow a book. But then give preference to people they like,\" Makary wrote in a 2021 opinion article in Fox News.",
      "More recently, he's called for a ban on cell phones on schools, and praised Kennedy for questioning the use of anti-anxiety and anti-obesity drugs in children.",
      "\"What he is really focused on is this concept that we can't keep drugging our nation's children,\" Makary said of Kennedy.",
      "When asked if Kennedy can accomplish what he wants to do in four years, Makary told Fox News he'll try by bringing in more scientists and letting \"them do good work.\"",
      "Kennedy \"is really the quintessential environmental health attorney of our era, and that may be the quintessential issue of our era,\" Makary said.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 11:46:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Peach and Blossom are the two lucky turkeys from Minnesota who are escaping a fowl fate as part of a White House tradition.",
    "story": [
      "The pair of Minnesota birds are Biden's last Thanksgiving pardons.",
      "Peach and Blossom are the two lucky turkeys from Minnesota who escaped a fowl fate of ending up on someone's Thanksgiving table this year when they were pardoned Monday by President Biden at the White House.",
      "\"This event marks the official start of the holiday season here in Washington,\" Biden said to what he said was a crowd of 2,500 gathered on the South Lawn. \"It's also my last time to speak here as your president during this season and give thanks and gratitude. So let me say to you, it's been the honor of my life. I'm forever grateful.\"",
      "\"May we use this moment to take time from our busy lives and focus on what matters most: our families,\" Biden said. \"My dad used to have an expression, family is the beginning, the middle and the end, our friends and our neighbors. The fact that we are blessed to live in America, the greatest country on Earth -- and that's not hyperbole. We are. No matter what, in America we never give up. We keep going, we keep the faith.\"",
      "These birds were plucked for the presidential flock and went through rigorous training to ride the gravy train to the White House for the honor, according to John Zimmerman, chairman of the National Turkey Federation.",
      "Zimmerman's 9-year-old son Grant and other young trainers made sure their feathers wouldn't be ruffled by the spotlight.",
      "\"Preparing these presidential birds has taken a lot of special care,\" Zimmerman said Sunday during a news conference introducing the two turkeys. \"We've been getting them used to lights, camera and even introducing them to a wide variety of music -- everything from polka to classic rock.\"",
      "Peach and Blossom, weighing 41 and 40 pounds, respectively, where hatched back in July. They traveled to Washington this week and were treated to a suite at the Willard InterContinental hotel before their big day on Monday, as is tradition.",
      "Biden said the birds were named after the Delaware state flower: the Peach Blossom.",
      "The president joked Peach lived by the motto \"keep calm and gobble on.\" Blossom's mantra, he said, was \"no foul play, just Minnesota nice.\"",
      "Biden at times was interrupted by gobbles, responding by saying one was making a \"last-minute plea.\"",
      "After the pardons, the two turkeys were headed back to Waseca, Minnesota, to live out the remainder of the feathery lives as \"agricultural ambassadors\" at Farmamerica, an agricultural interpretive center.",
      "Previous poultry pardoned under Biden include Liberty and Bell in 2023, Chocolate and Chip in 2022, and Peanut Butter and Jelly in 2021.",
      "\"And today, Peach and Blossom will join the free birds of the United States of America,\" Biden said.",
      "The turkey pardon at the White House is an annual tradition that is usually \"cranned\" full of a cornucopia of corny jokes.",
      "The origin of the presidential turkey pardons is a bit fuzzy. Unofficially, reports point all the way back to Abraham Lincoln, who spared a bird from its demise at the urging of his son, Tad. However, that story might be more folklore than fact.",
      "The true start of what has evolved into the current tradition has its roots in politics and dates back to the Harry Truman presidency in 1947.",
      "Truman ruffled feathers by starting \"poultry-less Thursdays\" to try and conserve various foods in the aftermath of World War II, but Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day all fell on Thursdays.",
      "Thanksgiving traditions at the White House",
      "After the White House was inundated with live birds sent as part of a \"Hens for Harry\" counter-initiative, the National Turkey Federation and the Poultry and Egg National Board presented Truman with a bird as a peace offering -- although the turkey was not saved from a holiday feast.",
      "President John F. Kennedy began the trend of publicly sparing a turkey given to the White House in November 1963, just days before his assassination. In the years following, the event became a bit more sporadic, with even some first ladies such as Pat Nixon and Rosalynn Carter stepping in to accept the guests of honor on their husband's behalf.",
      "The tradition of the public sparing returned in earnest during the Reagan administration, but the official tradition of the poultry pardoning at the White House started in 1989, when then-President George H.W. Bush offered the first official presidential pardon. In the more than three decades since, at least one lucky bird has gotten some extra gobbles each year.",

    "story": [
      "Current chair Harrison also announces a series of four candidate forums.",
      "The election of a new chair of the Democratic National Committee, along with other top leadership positions, will be Feb. 1, 2025, at the party\u2019s winter meeting in National Harbor, Maryland, according to a DNC official.",
      "This selection of incoming DNC officers, which includes chair, vice chairs, treasurer, secretary, and national finance chair positions, comes as the party grapples with the results of the 2024 election, when they lost the presidency, control of the U.S. Senate and were not able to earn the majority in the House.",
      "Laying out the next steps for party leadership, current DNC Chair Jamie Harrison -- who is not vying for a second term -- also announced on Monday that the party will host four forums for candidates to make their case to the 448 active DNC members who will be voting on their bids.",
      "The forums, set to be both in-person and virtually, will provide \u201copportunities for engagement of grassroots Democrats,\u201d a party official said, and will \u201cfocus on the questions and concerns of DNC members, elected representatives who will ultimately vote to elect the incoming officers.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs my time as Chair comes to a close and we prepare to undertake the critical work of holding the Trump Administration and Republican Party accountable for their extremism and false promises, we are beginning to lay out the process for upcoming DNC officer elections in the New Year. The DNC is committed to running a transparent, equitable, and impartial election for the next generation of leadership to guide the party forward,\u201d Harrison said in a statement on Monday.",
      "Harrison and all DNC staff will maintain complete neutrality throughout the process, including abstaining from endorsing or campaigning for any candidate, a party official told ABC.",
      "\u201cElecting the Chair and DNC officers is one of the most important responsibilities of the DNC Membership, and our staff will run an inclusive and transparent process that gives members the opportunity to get to know the candidates as they prepare to cast their votes,\u201d Harrison added.",
      "The DNC\u2019s Rules and Bylaws Committee is set to meet on Dec. 12 to first develop a process for selecting Democratic Party officers. They\u2019ll recommend a \"Rules of Procedure\" for the nomination and election of the candidates that will be sent to full membership for the vote during the winter meeting, which begins Jan. 30 in National Harbor.",
      "Included in these rules are the requirements for gaining access to the ballot. In 2021, candidates were required to submit a nominating statement alongside the signatures of 40 DNC members. The DNC intends to use this 40 signature threshold for candidate participation in the forums, a party official said to ABC.",
      "Thus far, there are two candidates actively campaigning to be the next chair. Former Maryland governor and Baltimore mMayor Martin O\u2019Malley, who has served since December 2023 as the commissioner of the Social Security Administration, a week ago was the first to throw his hat into the ring for what is expected to be many bids to lead a Democratic party left in disarray following their election losses earlier this month.",
      "\"We must connect our Party with the most important place in America -- the kitchen table of every family\u2019s home. Jobs, Opportunity, and Economic Security for all. Getting things done. Hope. A 50 state strategy. Now.\u201d he said on Monday in a post on X.",
      "Shortly after, Ken Martin of Minnesota, a vice chair of the DNC who also serves as chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party and president of the Association of State Democratic Committees, entered the race.",
      "In a statement, Martin says he\u2019s already garnered the endorsement of 83 DNC members and will be \u201cworking to earn every vote between now and the party elections.\u201d In his launch, Martin emphasized the party's need to \"hit the pavement, get out of DC for a bit, and go to the states -- to listen, reconnect with the voters, and restore a strong and resilient party.\"",
      "Other names floated for DNC chair have been ambassador to Japan and former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chairman Ben Wikler, and Chuck Rocha, a political strategist who worked for Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, among others. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy won't be running for the role, ABC News has confirmed, after some speculation about his candidacy had been rumored.",
      "The 448 DNC members who will vote on Feb. 1 includes 200 state elected members from 57 states, territories, and Democrats Abroad; members representing 16 affiliate groups; and 73 current at-large members elected by the DNC.",

      "She had secret meetings, as a congresswoman, with Syria\u2019s president.",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Republican senators pushed back on Sunday against criticism from Democrats that Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump's pick to lead U.S. intelligence services, is \u201ccompromised\u201d by her comments supportive of Russia and secret meetings, as a congresswoman, with Syria\u2019s president, a close ally of the Kremlin and Iran.",
      "Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat and veteran of combat missions in Iraq, said she had concerns about Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's choice to be director of national intelligence.",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s compromised,\" Duckworth said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\" citing Gabbard's 2017 trip to Syria, where she held talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad. Gabbard was a Democratic House member from Hawaii at the time.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. intelligence community has identified her as having troubling relationships with America\u2019s foes. And so my worry is that she couldn\u2019t pass a background check,\u201d Duckworth said.",
      "Gabbard, who said last month she is joining the Republican Party, has served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades. She was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait and, according to the Hawaii National Guard, received a Combat Medical Badge in 2005 for \u201cparticipation in combat operations under enemy hostile fire in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III.\"",
      "Duckworth's comments drew immediate backlash from Republicans.",
      "\u201cFor her to say ridiculous and outright dangerous words like that is wrong,\" Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma, said on CNN, challenging Duckworth to retract her words. \u201cThat\u2019s the most dangerous thing she could say \u2014 is that a United States lieutenant colonel in the United States Army is compromised and is an asset of Russia.\u201d",
      "In recent days, other Democrats have accused Gabbard without evidence of being a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has claimed, without offering details, that Gabbard is in Russian President Vladimir \u201cPutin\u2019s pocket.\u201d",
      "Mullin and others say the criticism from Democrats is rooted in the fact that Gabbard left their party and has become a Trump ally. Democrats say they worry that Gabbard's selection as national intelligence chief endangers ties with allies and gives Russia a win.",
      "Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat just elected to the Senate, said he would not describe Gabbard as a Russian asset, but said she had \u201cvery questionable judgment.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem is if our foreign allies don\u2019t trust the head of our intelligence agencies, they\u2019ll stop sharing information with us,\u201d Schiff said on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Gabbard in 2022 endorsed one of Russia\u2019s justifications for invading Ukraine: the existence of dozens of U.S.-funded biolabs working on some of the world\u2019s nastiest pathogens. The labs are part of an international effort to control outbreaks and stop bioweapons, but Moscow claimed Ukraine was using them to create deadly bioweapons. Gabbard said she just voiced concerns about protecting the labs.",
      "Gabbard also has suggested that Russia had legitimate security concerns in deciding to invade Ukraine, given its desire to join NATO.",
      "Republican Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri said he thought it was \u201ctotally ridiculous\u201d that Gabbard was being cast as a Russian asset for having different political views.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s insulting. It\u2019s a slur, quite frankly. There\u2019s no evidence that she\u2019s a asset of another country,\u201d he said on NBC.",

      "The Thanksgiving travel rush is expected to be bigger than ever this year",
      "DALLAS -- Just as there are good odds the turkey will taste dry, airports and highways are expected to be jam-packed during Thanksgiving week, a holiday period likely to end in another record day for air travel in the United States.",
      "The people responsible for keeping security lines, boarding areas and jetliners moving \u2014 from the U.S. transportation secretary and airline chiefs on down the line \u2014 swear they are prepared for the crowds.",
      "Airline passengers might get lucky like they did last year, when relatively few flights were canceled during the holiday week. A repeat will require the weather's cooperation. And even if skies are blue, a shortage of air traffic controllers could create delays.",
      "U.S. flights appeared to running relatively normally on Monday, with fewer than 40 canceled but more than 1,600 delayed by midday on the East Coast, according to FlightAware.",
      "Auto club and insurance company AAA predicts that nearly 80 million Americans will venture at least 50 miles from home between Tuesday and next Monday. Most of them will travel by car.",
      "Drivers should get a slight break on gas prices. The nationwide average price for gasoline was $3.06 a gallon on Monday, down from $3.26 at this time last year.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 18.3 million people at U.S. airports during the same seven-day stretch. That would be 6% more than during the corresponding days last year but fit a pattern set throughout 2024.",
      "The TSA predicts that 3 million people will pass through airport security checkpoints on Sunday; more than that could break the record of 3.01 million set on the Sunday after the July Fourth holiday. Tuesday and Wednesday are expected to be the next-busiest air travel days of Thanksgiving week.",
      "\u201cThis will be the busiest Thanksgiving ever in terms of air travel,\u201d TSA Administrator David Pekoske said. \u201cFortunately, our staffing is also at the highest levels that they have ever been. We are ready.\u201d",
      "Pekoske said TSA will have enough screeners to keep general security lines under 30 minutes and lines for people who pay extra for PreCheck under 10 minutes.",
      "Workers who clean planes, remove trash and help with wheelchairs at North Carolina\u2019s Charlotte Douglas International Airport began what was expected to be a 24-hour strike over their demands for higher wages. More than 200 flights were delayed, but there were very few cancellations.",
      "The Charlotte airport is the nation's ninth-busiest in passenger volume and serves as a hub for American Airlines. Airport officials expect about 1 million passengers to depart on flights between last Thursday and next Monday.",
      "An ongoing shortage of air traffic controllers could cause flight delays at other airports.",
      "Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Mike Whitaker said last week that he expects his agency to use special measures to deal with shortages at some facilities.",
      "\u201cIf we are short on staff, we will slow traffic as needed to keep the system safe,\u201d he said.",
      "In the last two years, similar measures have slowed down flights in New York City and Florida.",
      "The FAA has long struggled with a shortage of controllers that airline officials expect will last for years, despite the agency's lofty hiring goals.",
      "Wintry weather is always a wild card for Thanksgiving and Christmas travel by plane and automobile.",
      "Forecasters predicted more rain in California, where crews were trying to restore power lost to flooding from storms late last week. The Midwest and Great Lakes regions were expected to get rain and snow Monday, while the Northeast was expected to get hit with wet and blustery conditions by Thursday and Friday.",
      "Thanksgiving Day takes place late this year, with the fourth Thursday of November falling on Nov. 28. That shortens the traditional shopping season and changes the rhythm of holiday travel.",
      "With more time before the holiday, people tend to spread out their outbound travel over more days, but everyone returns at the same time, said Andrew Watterson, the chief operating officer of Southwest Airlines.",
      "\u201cA late Thanksgiving leads to a big crush at the end \u2014 the Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday after Thanksgiving are usually very busy with Thanksgiving this late,\" Watterson said.",
      "Airlines did a relatively good job of handling holiday crowds last year, when the weather was mild in most of the country. Fewer than 400 U.S. flights were canceled during Thanksgiving week in 2023 \u2014 about one of every 450 flights. So far in 2024, airlines have canceled about 1.3% of all flights.",
      "The rise of remote work also has caused the Thanksgiving travel period to expand, AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic changed everything,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we have seen is that post-pandemic, people are leaving at certain times, perhaps even leaving the weekend before Thanksgiving, working remotely from their destination a couple of days, and then enjoying time with their loved ones.\u201d",
      "Nightmares of Thanksgivings past have further shaped holiday traffic jams. Motorists who learned to avoid traveling the day before and the Sunday after Thanksgiving have created new bottlenecks on other days, according to Diaz.",
      "\u201cBecause we warned for so long (that) Wednesday and Sunday are the worst days to travel, people were like, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to leave on Tuesday and come back on Monday to avoid the rush,\u2019\" she said. \u201cSo now those two days are congested as well.\u201d",
      "Airport security officials are pleading with passengers to arrive early, not to put lithium-ion batteries in checked bags in case they overheat, and to keep guns out of carry-on bags. TSA has discovered more than 6,000 guns at checkpoints this year, and most of them were loaded.",
      "Holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas bring out many infrequent travelers, and they often have questions about what they can bring on the plane.",
      "TSA has a list on its website of items that are banned or restricted.",
      "Drivers should know that Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons will be the worst times to travel by car, but it should be smooth sailing on freeways come Thanksgiving Day, according to transportation analytics company INRIX.",
      "On the return home, the best travel times for motorists are before 1 p.m. on Sunday, and before 8 a.m. or after 7 p.m. on Monday, the company said.",
      "In metropolitan areas like Boston, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle and Washington, \u201ctraffic is expected to be more than double what it typically is on a normal day,\u201d INRIX transportation analyst Bob Pishue said."

      "Travel, especially during the holiday season, can be stressful",
      "Travel can be stressful in the best of times. Now add in the high-level anxiety that seems to be baked into every holiday season and it's clear that travelers could use some help calming frazzled nerves.",
      "Travel pros say there is plenty you can do ahead of time to make for a happier and less-stressful holiday journey.",
      "A week before you leave, write down things you need to bring and tasks you need to do before the trip.",
      "\u201cThis can include essential packing items, as well as simple tasks like cleaning out old food from the fridge or watering the plants,\u201d says Jess Feldman, special projects editor at Travel and Leisure magazine. \u201cThe key is to leave the list out for the entire week before you go. I cross the to-dos off throughout the week, and it helps me feel extremely prepared, lessening the stress every time.\u201d",
      "Noise-canceling headphones can go a long way toward blocking out annoyances during travel, although if you use them you should keep an eye on display boards or your phone for any flight or gate changes.",
      "Spotify, YouTube and other sites offer music playlists with names like \u201cRelaxing Chill Out Calming Music for Airports\u201d and \u201cPerfect \u2014 Music Travel Relax.\" Or try \u201cMusic for Airports,\u201d a groundbreaking album that launched the ambient music genre in 1978.",
      "It\u2019s also good to carry extra medications, a change of clothes, a toothbrush and a phone-charging cable, just in case.",
      "Bringing along some snacks or a sandwich from home can feel comforting and be a great alternative to pricey airport offerings.",
      "\u201cI tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,\u201d Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container.",
      "To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.",
      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",
      "And don\u2019t forget your hair.",
      "\u201cJust as the low humidity on the airplane is dehydrating for your skin, it can also dry out your hair. If possible, use a deep conditioner before your trip,\u201d Gould says.",
      "\u201cEvery airline has different requirements when it comes to the boarding process, paying for perks in advance, or seat upgrades,\u201d Feldman says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to understand all of the above before getting to the airport so that you are not taken off guard.\u201d",
      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.",
      "If you\u2019re too early, you can always explore the airport shops and lounges or settle in with a good book somewhere.",
      "\u201cI always confirm whether or not there is a lounge I have access to in my departing gate ahead of time,\u201d Feldman says. But even without lounge access, she says, \"I like to know what the restaurants and waiting areas (near) the gate are like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you have a sense of why you are feeling stressed, it can help to figure out ways to reduce that stress,\" says Lynn F. Bufka, head of practice for the American Psychological Association. \"So if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, are there things that you can outsource? Is there someone in your family who can help with parts of the planning?\u201d",
      "Recognize that crowds, bad weather and canceled flights are beyond your control.",
      "And some people just don't like to travel far or to fly.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s fear, like fear of flying, it\u2019s important to know that it can be treated, and that treatment can really improve the quality of your life,\u201d Bufka says.",
      "A little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer or pantry will make for a much more welcoming return.",
      "\u201cAlways, always, always clean your space before leaving for a trip. You are inevitably going to feel a bit off after a long travel day, and coming home to an unorganized space will make it so much worse,\u201d Feldman says.",
      "Wash the sheets, take out the trash, put away clothes, clean the countertops. \u201cArriving home to a neat and tidy space is the best homecoming, especially after a long time away,\u201d she says.",

      "JACKSON, Miss. -- JACKSON, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Medical marijuana businesses in Mississippi don't have the right to advertise on billboards or other places because marijuana itself remains illegal under federal law, an appeals court says.",
      "The owner of a medical marijuana dispensary argued that the First Amendment protects the right to advertise because Mississippi law permits the sale of cannabis products to people with debilitating medical conditions. The state enacted its law in 2022.",
      "A three-judge panel of 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected the arguments about advertising. They cited the federal Controlled Substances Act, which since 1970 has prohibited the manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of marijuana.",
      "The federal law applies in all states, and Mississippi \u201cfaces no constitutional obstacle to restricting commercial speech relating to unlawful transactions,\u201d the judges wrote.",
      "The Mississippi attorney general's office praised the court decision for upholding \"Mississippi\u2019s reasonable restrictions on advertising for medical marijuana dispensaries by print, broadcast, and other mass communications,\u201d said the office spokesperson, MaryAsa Lee.",
      "Clarence Cocroft II operates Tru Source Medical Cannabis in the northern Mississippi city of Olive Branch. He sued the state in 2023 to challenge its ban on medical marijuana advertising on billboards or in print, broadcast or social media or via mass email or text messaging.",
      "\u201cUpholding this ban makes it incredibly difficult for me to find potential customers and to educate people about Mississippi\u2019s medical marijuana program,\u201d Cocroft said in a statement Monday. \u201cI remain committed to continuing this fight so my business can be treated the same as any other legal business in Mississippi.\u201d",
      "The state allows medical marijuana businesses to have websites or social media accounts that provide information about their retail dispensing locations and a list of products available. It allows them to be listed in phone books or business directories and to display cannabis in company logos. The businesses can also sponsor not-for-profit charity or advocacy events.",
      "Cocroft is represented by the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian law firm. The firm said Monday that it is considering its next steps in the lawsuit, including possibly asking the entire appeals court to reconsider the case or an appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cMississippi cannot on the one hand create an entire marketplace for the sale of medical marijuana, and on the other hand rely on an unenforced federal law to prohibit buyers and sellers from talking about it,\u201d said Ari Bargil, an Institute for Justice attorney."

      "While Trump vigorously campaigned against diversity and inclusion efforts in business and government, his Cabinet selections and other high-profile staffing choices include some barrier-breaking nominations. The Cabinet, if confirmed, is set to be one-third women and include some historic firsts.",
      "Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the State Department, would be the first Latino secretary of state. Scott Bessent, an American hedge fund manager and Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Treasury Department, would be the first openly gay man in that post.",

      "Eduardo Valdivia has been suspended by the FBI pending the conclusion of a police investigation in Montgomery County, Maryland, a bureau spokesperson said.",
      "\u201cThe FBI takes allegations of criminal violations and misconduct very seriously,\" the FBI spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cBecause this is an ongoing investigation, the FBI cannot comment further.\u201d",
      "Valdivia previously was charged and acquitted in 2022 of attempted second-degree murder and other charges stemming from an off-duty shooting aboard a moving Metro train near Washington, D.C.",
      "Online court records show Valdivia now faces felony and misdemeanor charges, including two counts of second-degree rape. The dates of the alleged offenses are in May 2024 and September 2024.",
      "Defense attorney Robert Bonsib, who represented Valdivia in the shooting case, confirmed that his client was arrested Monday on sexual assault charges.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t accept at first blush any of the allegations until all of the evidence is in,\" Bonsib said.",

      "Police detectives believe there may be additional victims, and they're planning a news conference on Tuesday \u201cto encourage them to come forward,\u201d the department said in a statement. Police didn't immediately release any other information about the charges.",
      "Valdivia, 40, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, was ordered held in custody after his initial court appearance on Monday, Bonsib said. Valdivia is scheduled to return to court Tuesday for a bond hearing before a judge, Bonsib said.",
      "Bonsib has said Valdivia joined the FBI in 2011 and was promoted to supervisory special agent at the FBI headquarters in 2019. The attorney said Valdivia had been working as an FBI agent since his acquittal.",
      "On Dec. 15, 2020, a confrontation between Valdivia and an unarmed passenger swiftly escalated from a testy exchange of words to a shooting on a train approaching the Medical Center station in Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Valdivia shot and wounded the man from a distance of roughly 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters) after repeatedly telling the man to back up, county prosecutor Robert Hill said in court. The wounded man had part or all of his spleen, colon and pancreas removed during surgery after the shooting, Hill said.",
      "Bonsib has said Valdivia acted in self-defense as the man approached him at the rear of a train car.",
      "\u201cThe law does not require that you wait to be struck before you take action. Had this resulted in a hands-on fight and a struggle for Agent Valdivia\u2019s gun, only God knows what could have happened,\u201d Bonsib said after Valdivia was charged."

Such an approach could soothe worries on Wall Street that Trump\u2019s policies may lead to a much bigger deficit, which in turn would put upward pressure on Treasury yields and drive prices lower.",
      "After climbing above 4.44% immediately after Trump\u2019s election, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell back to 4.26% Monday, down from 4.41% late Friday. That\u2019s a notable move, and lower yields make it cheaper for all kinds of companies and households to borrow money. They also give a boost to prices for stocks and other investments.",
      "The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks jumped 1.5%. It finished just shy of its all-time high, which was set three years ago. Smaller companies can feel bigger boosts from lower borrowing costs because of the need for many to borrow to grow.",
      "The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks the market\u2019s expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do with overnight interest rates, also eased sharply.",
      "The Fed began cutting its main interest rate just a couple months ago from a two-decade high, hoping to keep the job market humming after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. But immediately after Trump\u2019s victory, traders had reduced bets for how many cuts the Fed may deliver next year. They were worried Trump\u2019s preference for lower tax rates and higher spending on the border would balloon the national debt.",
      "A report coming on Wednesday could influence how much the Fed may cut rates. Economists expect it to show that an underlying inflation trend the Fed prefers to use accelerated to 2.8% last month from 2.7% in September. Higher inflation would make the Fed more reluctant to cut rates as deeply or as quickly as it would otherwise.",
      "In the stock market, Bath & Body Works jumped 16.5% after delivering stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The seller of personal care products and home fragrances also raised its financial forecasts for the full year.",
      "Much focus has been on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain, given high prices across the economy and still-high interest rates.",
      "Another big retailer, Macy\u2019s, said Monday its sales for the latest quarter were in line with its expectations, but it will delay the release of its full financial results. It found a single employee had intentionally hid up to $154 million in delivery expenses, and it needs more time to complete its investigation. Macy\u2019s stock fell 2.2%.",
      "In other dealings early Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude added 23 cents to $69.17 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 19 cents to $72.67 a barrel.",
      "In currency trading, the U.S. dollar slipped to 153.82 Japanese yen from 154.11 yen. The euro cost $1.0462, down from $1.0499.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department and Google have made their closing arguments in a trial alleging Google\u2019s online advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Google, already facing a possible breakup of the company over its ubiquitous search engine, is fighting to beat back another attack by the U.S. Department of Justice alleging monopolistic conduct, this time over technology that puts online advertising in front of consumers.",
      "The Justice Department and Google made closing arguments Monday in a trial alleging Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, will decide the case and is expected to issue a written ruling by the end of the year. If Brinkema finds Google has engaged in illegal, monopolistic conduct, she will then hold further hearings to explore what remedies should be imposed.",
      "The Justice Department, along with a coalition of states, has already said it believes Google should be forced to sell off parts of its ad tech business, which generates tens of billions of dollars annually for the Mountain View, California-based company.",
      "After roughly a month of trial testimony earlier this year, the arguments in the case remain the same.",
      "During three hours of arguments Monday, Brinkema, who sometimes tips her hand during legal arguments, did little to indicate how she might rule. She did, though, question the applicability of a key antitrust case Google cites in its defense.",
      "The Justice Department contends Google built and maintained a monopoly in \u201copen-web display advertising,\u201d essentially the rectangular ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of the page when one browses websites.",
      "Google dominates all facets of the market. A technology called DoubleClick is used pervasively by news sites and other online publishers, while Google Ads maintains a cache of advertisers large and small looking to place their ads on the right webpage in front of the right consumer.",
      "In between is another Google product, AdExchange, that conducts nearly instantaneous auctions matching advertisers to publishers.",
      "In court papers, Justice Department lawyers say Google \u201cis more concerned with acquiring and preserving its trifecta of monopolies than serving its own publisher and advertiser customers or winning on the merits.\u201d",
      "As a result, content providers and news organizations have never been able to generate the online revenue they should due to Google\u2019s excessive fees for brokering transactions between advertisers and publishers, the government says.",
      "Google argues the government's case improperly focuses on a narrow niche of online advertising. If one looks more broadly at online advertising to include social media, streaming TV services, and app-based advertising, Google says it controls as little as 10% of the market, a share that is dwindling as it faces increased and evolving competition.",
      "Google alleges in court papers that the government\u2019s lawsuit \u201cboil(s) down to the persistent complaints of a handful of Google\u2019s rivals and several mammoth publishers.\u201d",
      "Google also says it has invested billions in technology that facilitates the efficient match of advertisers to interested consumers and it should not be forced to share its technology and success with competitors.",
      "\u201cRequiring a company to do further engineering work to make its technology and customers accessible by all of its competitors on their preferred terms has never been compelled by U.S. antitrust law,\u201d the company wrote.",
      "Brinkema, during Monday's arguments, also sought clarity on Google\u2019s market share, a number the two sides dispute, depending on how broadly the market is defined.",
      "Historically, courts have been unwilling to declare an illegal monopoly in markets in which a company holds less than a 70% market share. Google says that when online display advertising is viewed as a whole, it holds only a 10% market share, and dwindling.",
      "The Justice Department contends, though, that when focusing on open-web display advertising, Google controls 91% of the market for publisher ad servers and 87% of the market for advertiser ad networks.",
      "Google says that the \u201copen web display advertising\u201d market is gerrymandered by the Justice Department to make Google look bad, and that nobody in the industry looks at that category of ads without considering the ability of advertisers to switch to other forms of advertising, like in mobile apps.",
      "The Justice Department also contends that the public is harmed by the excessive rates Google charges to facilitate ad purchases, saying the company takes 36 cents on the dollar when it facilitates the transaction end to end.",
      "Google says its \u201ctake rate\u201d has dropped to 31% and continues to decrease, and it says that rate is lower than that of its competitors.",
      "\u201cWhen you have an integrated system, one of the benefits is lower prices,\" Google lawyer Karen Dunn said Monday.",
      "The Virginia case is separate from an ongoing lawsuit brought against Google in the District of Columbia over its namesake search engine. In that case, the judge determined it constitutes an illegal monopoly but has not decided what remedy to impose.",
      "The Justice Department said last week it will seek to force Google to sell its Chrome web browser, among a host of other penalties. Google has said the department's request is overkill and unhinged from legitimate regulation.",
      "In Monday's arguments, Justice Department lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum cited the search engine case when he highlighted an email from a Google executive, David Rosenblatt, who said in a 2009 email that Google\u2019s goal was to \u201cdo to display what Google did to search,\" which Teitelbaum said showed the company's intent to achieve market dominance.",
      "\u201cGoogle did not achieve its trifecta of monopolies by accident,\u201d Teitelbaum said."

    "summary": "Federal prosecutors have moved to abandon two criminal cases against Donald Trump, acknowledging that Trump&rsquo;s return to the White House will preclude attempts to federally prosecute him for retaining classified documents or trying to overturn his 2020 ...",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors have moved to abandon two criminal cases against Donald Trump, acknowledging that Trump\u2019s return to the White House will preclude attempts to federally prosecute him for retaining classified documents or trying to overturn his 2020 ...",
      "WASHINGTON -- Special counsel Jack Smith moved to abandon two criminal cases against Donald Trump on Monday, acknowledging that Trump\u2019s return to the White House will preclude attempts to federally prosecute him for retaining classified documents or trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat.",
      "The decision was inevitable, since longstanding Justice Department policy says sitting presidents cannot face criminal prosecution. Yet it was still a momentous finale to an unprecedented chapter in political and law enforcement history, as federal officials attempted to hold accountable a former president while he was simultaneously running for another term.",
      "Trump emerges indisputably victorious, having successfully delayed the investigations through legal maneuvers and then winning reelection despite indictments that described his actions as a threat to the country's constitutional foundations.",
      "\u201cI persevered, against all odds, and WON,\" Trump exulted in a post on Truth Social, his social media website.",
      "He also said that \u201cthese cases, like all of the other cases I have been forced to go through, are empty and lawless, and should never have been brought.\u201d",
      "The judge in the election case granted prosecutors' dismissal request. A decision in the documents case was still pending on Monday evening.",
      "The outcome makes it clear that, when it comes to a president and criminal accusations, nothing supersedes the voters' own verdict. In court filings, Smith's team emphasized that the move to end their prosecutions was not a reflection of the merit of the cases but a recognition of the legal shield that surrounds any commander in chief.",
      "\u201cThat prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government\u2019s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Government stands fully behind,\u201d prosecutors said in one of their filings.",
      "They wrote that Trump\u2019s return to the White House \u201csets at odds two fundamental and compelling national interests: on the one hand, the Constitution\u2019s requirement that the President must not be unduly encumbered in fulfilling his weighty responsibilities . . . and on the other hand, the Nation\u2019s commitment to the rule of law.\u201d",
      "In this situation, \u201cthe Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated,\u201d they concluded.",
      "Smith\u2019s team said it was leaving intact charges against two co-defendants in the classified documents case \u2014 Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira \u2014 because \u201cno principle of temporary immunity applies to them.\u201d",
      "Steven Cheung, Trump's incoming White House communications director, said Americans \u201cwant an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.\u201d",
      "Trump has long described the investigations as politically motivated, and he has vowed to fire Smith as soon as he takes office in January. Now he will start his second term free from criminal scrutiny by the government that he will lead.",
      "The election case brought last year was once seen as one of the most serious legal threats facing Trump as he tried to reclaim the White House. He was indicted for plotting to overturn his defeat to Joe Biden in 2020, an effort that climaxed with his supporters' violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "But the case quickly stalled amid legal fighting over Trump\u2019s sweeping claims of immunity from prosecution for acts he took while in the White House.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in July ruled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution, and sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine which allegations in the indictment, if any, could proceed to trial.",
      "The case was just beginning to pick up steam again in the trial court in the weeks leading up to this year\u2019s election. Smith\u2019s team in October filed a lengthy brief laying out new evidence it planned to use against him at trial, accusing him of \u201cresorting to crimes\u201d in an increasingly desperate effort to overturn the will of voters after he lost to Biden.",
      "In dismissing the case, Chutkan acknowledged prosecutors' request to do so \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d raising the possibility that they could try to bring charges against Trump when his term is over. She wrote that is \u201cconsistent with the Government\u2019s understanding that the immunity afforded to a sitting President is temporary, expiring when they leave office.\u201d",
      "But such a move may be barred by the statute of limitations, and Trump may also try to pardon himself while in office.",
      "The separate case involving classified documents had been widely seen as legally clear cut, especially because the conduct in question occurred after Trump left the White House and lost the powers of the presidency.",
      "The indictment included dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally hoarding classified records from his presidency at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and obstructing federal efforts to get them back. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "The case quickly became snarled by delays, with U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon slow to issue rulings \u2014 which favored Trump\u2019s strategy of pushing off deadlines in all his criminal cases \u2014 while also entertaining defense motions and arguments that experts said other judges would have dispensed with without hearings.",
      "In May, she indefinitely canceled the trial date amid a series of unresolved legal issues before dismissing the case outright two months later. Smith\u2019s team appealed the decision, but now has given up that effort.",
      "Trump faced two other state prosecutions while running for president. One of them, a New York case involving hush money payments, resulted in a conviction on felony charges of falsifying business records. It was the first time a former president had been found guilty of a crime.",
      "The sentencing in that case is on hold as Trump's lawyers try to have the conviction dismissed before he takes office, arguing that letting the verdict stand will interfere with his presidential transition and duties.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office is fighting the dismissal but has indicated that it would be open to delaying sentencing until Trump leaves office. Bragg, a Democrat, has said the solution needs to balance the obligations of the presidency with \u201cthe sanctity of the jury verdict.\"",
      "Trump was also indicted in Georgia along with 18 others accused of participating in a sprawling scheme to illegally overturn the 2020 presidential election there.",
      "Any trial appears unlikely there while Trump holds office. The prosecution already was on hold after an appeals court agreed to review whether to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over her romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she had hired to lead the case.",
      "Four defendants have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty.",

      "Lawyers for a voting machine company that's suing Fox News want to question Rupert Murdoch about his contentious efforts to change his family trust",
      "Lawyers for a voting machine company that\u2019s suing Fox News want to question founder Rupert Murdoch about his contentious efforts to change his family trust, the attorneys told a court Monday.",
      "Election-tech company Smartmatic's $2.7 billion defamation suit regards Fox's reporting on 2020 voting fraud claims. But Smartmatic\u2019s attorneys suggest the separate succession fight over Murdoch's media empire might shed light on any Fox Corp. involvement in editorial matters.",
      "It's an important, if technical, question as Smartmatic seeks to hold the deep-pocketed Fox parent company responsible for statements that the news network aired. Fox contends that there's no such liability and that it was engaging in journalism, not defamation, when it broadcast election-fraud allegations made by then-President Donald Trump 's attorneys.",
      "Rupert Murdoch may already have given a deposition \u2014 out-of-court questioning under oath \u2014 in the defamation suit. Such records aren't public at this stage, but plans for his deposition were briefly mentioned at a 2022 hearing.",
      "Smartmatic now is seeking to talk to Murdoch about his efforts to rewrite his plans for his businesses after his death.",
      "The matter is playing out behind closed doors and in sealed files in a Nevada probate court. The New York Times has reported that Rupert Murdoch wants to keep his eldest son, Lachlan, in charge of the conglomerate's newspapers and television networks in order to ensure a continued conservative editorial outlook.",
      "Smartmatic wants to get the 93-year-old patriarch on record while the probate matter plays out, company attorney Edward Wipper told a judge Monday.",
      "Fox News lawyer K. Winn Allen said the probate case \u201chas nothing at all to do with\u201d Smartmatic's claims and is \u201cnot appropriate\u201d fodder for the suit.",
      "Fox Corp. declined to comment after court.",
      "Fox News' lawyers, meanwhile, want Smartmatic to provide records about a U.S. federal criminal case against people, including Smartmatic co-founder Roger Pi\u00f1ate, accused of scheming to bribe a Filipino election official. Pi\u00f1ate has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Smartmatic isn't charged in the criminal case, and Smartmatic attorneys have said the matter was irrelevant to the defamation suit. Fox lost prior bids for a court order to get the information, but a hearing on the network's renewed request is set next week.",
      "It's unclear how soon Judge David B. Cohen will decide on that request or on Smartmatic's bid to dig into the Murdoch family trust case. Both requests are part of pretrial information-gathering, and no trial date has been set.",
      "Smartmatic says it was a small player, working only with California's heavily Democratic Los Angeles County, in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.",
      "In subsequent Fox News appearances, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell portrayed Smartmatic as part of a multi-state scheme to steal the vote from the Republican.",
      "Federal and state election officials, exhaustive reviews in battleground states and Trump\u2019s own attorney general found no widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that the vote was tainted. Dozens of courts, including by judges whom Trump had appointed, rejected his fraud claims.",
      "Fox News ultimately aired an interview with an election technology expert who refuted the allegations against Smartmatic \u2014 an interview done after the company demanded a retraction.",
      "The network is countersuing Smartmatic, claiming it violated a New York law against baseless suits aimed at squelching reporting or criticism on public issues.",
      "The New York defamation suit is one of several stemming from conservative-oriented news outlets' reports on Trump\u2019s 2020 vote-rigging claims. Smartmatic recently settled with One America News Network and Newsmax.",
      "Fox News settled for $787 million last year with Dominion Voting Systems, another election-technology company that sued over conspiracy theories blaming its election equipment for Trump\u2019s 2020 loss."

      "Egg prices are on the rise again as a lingering outbreak of bird flu coincides with high demand during the holiday baking season",
      "Egg prices are rising once more as a lingering outbreak of bird flu coincides with the high demand of the holiday baking season.",
      "But prices are still far from the recent peak they reached almost two years ago. And the American Egg Board, a trade group, says egg shortages at grocery stores have been isolated and temporary so far.",
      "\u201cThose are being rapidly corrected, sometimes within a day,\u201d said Emily Metz, the Egg Board's president and chief executive officer.",
      "The average price for a dozen eggs in U.S. cities was $3.37 in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was down slightly from September, and down significantly from January 2023, when the average price soared to $4.82. But it was up 63% from October 2023, when a dozen eggs cost an average of $2.07.",
      "Metz said the egg industry sees its highest demand in November and December.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have your holiday baking, your pumpkin pie, your stuffing, without eggs,\u201d she said.",
      "Avian influenza is the main reason for the higher prices. The current bird flu outbreak that began in February 2022 has led to the slaughter of more than 111 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens. Anytime the virus is found, every bird on a farm is killed to limit the spread of  the disease.",
      "More than 6 million birds have been slaughtered just this month because of bird flu. They were a relatively small part of the total U.S. egg-laying flock of 377 million chickens. Still, the flock is down about 3% over the past year, contributing to a 4% drop in egg production, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "The latest wave of bird flu is scrambling supplies of cage-free eggs because California has been among the hardest hit states. California, Nevada, Washington and Oregon all require eggs sold in their states to be cage-free.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re having to move eggs from other areas of the country that are producing cage-free to cover that low supply in those states, because those states only allow for cage-free eggs to be sold,\u201d Metz said.",
      "Cage-free requirements are set to go into effect in Arizona, Colorado and Michigan next year and in Rhode Island and Utah in 2030.",
      "Demand for such specialty eggs may also be contributing to avian flu, which is spread through the droppings of wild birds as they migrate past farms. Allowing chickens to roam more freely puts them at greater risk, said Chad Hart, a professor and agricultural economist at Iowa State University.",
      "\u201cIt's really hard to control that interaction between domesticated birds and wild birds,\u201d Hart said. \"Some of those vectors have been opened up because we\u2019re asking the egg industry to produce in ways that we didn\u2019t ask them to before.\u201d",
      "Metz said climate change and extreme weather are also blowing some wild birds off course.",
      "\u201cWe have birds that have been displaced by hurricanes, by wildfires, and those birds are now circulating in areas that they otherwise might not circulate or at times of the year that they otherwise may not be circulating,\" she said. \"And those are all new variables that our farmers are having to deal with.\u201d",
      "Hart said the egg industry is trying to rebuild the flock, but that also can limit supplies, since farmers have to hold back some eggs to hatch into new chickens.",
      "Still, there is some good news on U.S. poultry farms. The price of chicken feed \u2014 which represents 70% of a farmer's costs \u2014 has fallen significantly after doubling between 2020 and 2022, Hart said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump\u2019s personnel choices for his new Cabinet and White House reflect his signature positions on immigration and trade but also a range of viewpoints and backgrounds that raise questions about what ideological anchors might guide his Oval Office encore.",
      "With a rapid assembly of his second administration \u2014 faster than his effort eight years ago \u2014 the former and incoming president has combined television personalities, former Democrats, a wrestling executive and traditional elected Republicans into a mix that makes clear his intentions to impose tariffs on imported goods and crack down on illegal immigration but leaves open a range of possibilities on other policy pursuits.",
      "\u201cThe president has his two big priorities and doesn\u2019t feel as strongly about anything else \u2014 so it\u2019s going to be a real jump ball and zigzag,\u201d predicted Marc Short, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence during Trump\u2019s 2017-21 term. \u201cIn the first administration, he surrounded himself with more conservative thinkers, and the results showed we were mostly rowing in the same direction. This is more eclectic.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Secretary of State-designee Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who has pilloried authoritarian regimes around the world, is in line to serve as top diplomat to a president who praises autocratic leaders like Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban.",
      "Republican Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer of Oregon has been tapped to sit at the Cabinet table as a pro-union labor secretary alongside multiple billionaires, former governors and others who oppose making it easier for workers to organize themselves.",
      "The prospective treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, wants to cut deficits for a president who promised more tax cuts, better veterans services and no rollbacks of the largest federal outlays: Social Security, Medicare and national defense.",
      "Abortion-rights supporter Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is Trump's choice to lead the Health and Human Services Department, which Trump\u2019s conservative Christian base has long targeted as an agency where the anti-abortion movement must wield more influence.",
      "Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich allowed that members of Trump\u2019s slate will not always agree with the president and certainly not with one another. But he minimized the potential for irreconcilable differences: \u201cA strong Cabinet, by definition, means you\u2019re going to have people with different opinions and different skills.\u201d",
      "That kind of unpredictability is at the core of Trump\u2019s political identity. He is the erstwhile reality TV star who already upended Washington once and is returning to power with sweeping, sometimes contradictory promises that convinced voters, especially those in the working class, that he will do it all again.",
      "\u201cWhat Donald Trump has done is reorient political leadership and activism to a more entrepreneurial spirit,\u201d Gingrich said.",
      "There's also plenty of room for conflict, given the breadth of Trump's 2024 campaign promises and his pattern of cycling through Cabinet members and national security personnel during his first term.",
      "This time, Trump has pledged to impose tariffs on foreign goods, end illegal immigration and launch a mass deportation force, goose U.S. energy production and exact retribution on people who opposed \u2014 and prosecuted \u2014 him. He's added promises to cut taxes, raise wages, end wars in Israel and Ukraine, streamline government, protect Social Security and Medicare, help veterans and squelch cultural progressivism.",
      "Trump alluded to some of those promises in recent weeks as he completed his proposed roster of federal department heads and named top White House staff members. But his announcements skimmed over any policy paradoxes or potential complications.",
      "Bessent has crusaded as a deficit hawk, warning that the ballooning national debt, paired with higher interest rates, drives consumer inflation. But he also supports extending Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts that added to the overall debt and annual debt service payments to investors who buy Treasury notes.",
      "A hedge-fund billionaire, Bessent built his wealth in world markets. Yet, generally speaking, he\u2019s endorsed Trump's tariffs. He rejects the idea that they feed inflation and instead frames tariffs as one-time price adjustments and leverage to achieve U.S. foreign policy and domestic economic aims.",
      "Trump, for his part, declared that Bessent would \u201chelp me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States.\u201d",
      "Chavez-DeRemer, Trump promised, \u201cwill achieve historic cooperation between Business and Labor that will restore the American Dream for Working Families.\u201d",
      "Trump did not address the Oregon congresswoman\u2019s staunch support for the PRO-Act, a Democratic-backed measure that would make it easier for workers to unionize, among other provisions. That proposal passed the House when Democrats held a majority. But it\u2019s never had measurable Republican support in either chamber on Capitol Hill, and Trump has never made it part of his agenda.",
      "When Trump named Kennedy as his pick for health secretary, he did not mention the former Democrat\u2019s support for abortion rights. Instead, Trump put the focus on Kennedy\u2019s intention to take on the U.S. agriculture, food processing and drug manufacturing sectors.",
      "The vagaries of Trump\u2019s foreign policy stand out, as well. Trump's choice for national security adviser, Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, offered mixed messages Sunday when discussing the Russia-Ukraine war, which Trump claims never would have started had he been president, because he would have prevailed on Putin not to invade his neighboring country.",
      "Speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Waltz repeated Trump\u2019s concerns over recent escalations, which include President Joe Biden approving sending antipersonnel mines to Ukrainian forces.",
      "\u201cWe need to restore deterrence, restore peace and get ahead of this escalation ladder, rather than responding to it,\u201d Waltz said. But in the same interview, Waltz declared the mines necessary to help Ukraine \u201cstop Russian gains\u201d and said he\u2019s working \u201chand in glove\u201d with Biden\u2019s team during the transition.",
      "Meanwhile, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump\u2019s pick for director of national intelligence, the top intelligence post in government, is an outspoken defender of Putin and Syrian President Bashar al Assad, a close ally of Russia and Iran.",
      "Perhaps the biggest wildcards of Trump\u2019s governing constellation are budget-and-spending advisers Russell Vought, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Vought led Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget in his first term and is in line for the same post again. Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest man, and Ramaswamy, a mega-millionaire venture capitalist, are leading an outside advisory panel known as the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency.\u201d",
      "The latter effort is a quasi-official exercise to identify waste. It carries no statutory authority, but Trump can route Musk\u2019s and Ramaswamy\u2019s recommendations to official government pathways, including via Vought.",
      "A leading author of Project 2025, the conservative movement\u2019s blueprint for a hard-right turn in U.S. government and society, Vought envisions OMB not just as an influential office to shape Trump\u2019s budget proposals for Congress but a power center of the executive branch, \u201cpowerful enough to override implementing agencies\u2019 bureaucracies.\u201d",
      "As for how Trump might navigate differences across his administration, Gingrich pointed to Chavez-DeRemer.",
      "\u201cHe might not agree with her on union issues, but he might not stop her from pushing it herself,\u201d Gingrich said of the PRO-Act. \u201cAnd he will listen to anybody. If you convince him, he absolutely will spend presidential capital.\u201d",
      "Short said other factors are more likely to influence Trump: personalities and, of course, loyalty.",
      "Vought \u201cbrought him potential spending cuts\u201d in the first administration, Short said, \u201cthat Trump wouldn\u2019t go along with.\u201d This time, Short continued, \u201cmaybe Elon and Vivek provide backup,\u201d giving Vought the imprimatur of two wealthy businessmen.",
      "\u201cHe will always calculate who has been good to him,\u201d Short said. \u201cYou already see that: The unions got the labor secretary they wanted, and Putin and Assad got the DNI (intelligence chief) they wanted. \u2026 This is not so much a team-of-rivals situation.

      "That helped stocks of smaller companies lead the way, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks jumped 1.5%. It finished just shy of its all-time high, which was set three years ago. Smaller companies can feel bigger boosts from lower borrowing costs because of the need for many to borrow to grow.",
      "The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks the market\u2019s expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do with overnight interest rates, also eased sharply.",
      "The Fed began cutting its main interest rate  just a couple months ago from a two-decade high, hoping to keep the job market humming  after bringing inflation nearly all the way down  to its 2% target. But immediately after Trump\u2019s victory, traders had reduced bets for how many cuts the Fed may deliver next year. They were worried Trump\u2019s preference for lower tax rates and higher spending on the border would balloon the national debt.",
      "A report coming on Wednesday could influence how much the Fed may cut rates. Economists expect it to show that an underlying inflation trend the Fed prefers to use accelerated to 2.8% last month from 2.7% in September. Higher inflation would make the Fed more reluctant to cut rates as deeply or as quickly as it would otherwise.",
      "Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle expects that to slow by the end of next year to 2.4%, but he said inflation would be even lower if not for expected tariff increases on imports from China and autos favored by Trump.",
      "In the stock market, Bath & Body Works  jumped 16.5% after delivering stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The seller of personal care products and home fragrances also raised its financial forecasts for the full year, even though it still sees a \u201cvolatile retail environment\u201d and a shorter holiday shopping season this year.",
      "Much focus has been on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain, given high prices across the economy and still-high interest rates. Last week, two major retailers sent mixed messages. Target tumbled  after giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook.",
      "Another big retailer, Macy\u2019s, said Monday its sales for the latest quarter were in line with its expectations, but it will delay the release of its full financial results. It found a single employee had intentionally hid up to $154 million in delivery expenses, and it needs more time to complete its investigation.",
      "Macy\u2019s stock fell 2.2%.",
      "Among the market\u2019s leaders were several companies related to the housing industry. Monday\u2019s drop in Treasury yields could translate into easier mortgage rates, which could spur activity for housing. Builders FirstSource, a supplier or building materials, rose 5.9%. Homebuilders, D.R. Horton, PulteGroup and Lennar all rose at least 5.6%.",
      "All told, the S&P 500 rose 18.03 points to 5,987.37. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 440.06 to 44,736.57, and the Nasdaq composite gained 51.18 to 19,054.84.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes moved modestly across much of Europe after finishing mixed in Asia.",
      "In the crypto market, bitcoin  was trading below $95,000 after threatening to hit $100,000 late last week for the first time.",

      "A white Florida woman who fatally shot a Black neighbor through her front door amid a long-running dispute has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for her manslaughter conviction",
      "A white Florida woman who fatally shot a Black neighbor through her front door during an ongoing dispute over the neighbor\u2019s boisterous children was sentenced Monday to 25 years in prison for her manslaughter conviction.",
      "Susan Lorincz, 60, was convicted in August of killing Ajike \u201cA.J.\u201d Owens, 35, by firing a single shot from her .380-caliber handgun in June 2023. She had faced a maximum of 30 years behind bars. Circuit Judge Robert Hodges opted for a slightly lesser term amid evidence that Lorincz had been abused as a child and had mental health problems.",
      "\u201cThe shooting was completely unnecessary in this case,\u201d Hodges said during an afternoon hearing. \u201cThe shooting, I find, was based more in anger than in fear.\u201d",
      "The shooting was the culmination of a long-running argument between the two neighbors over Owens\u2019 children playing in a grassy area near both of their houses in Ocala, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of Orlando.",
      "Prosecutors said Owens had come to Lorincz\u2019s home after her children complained that she had thrown roller skates and an umbrella at them, which Lorincz denied. Trial testimony showed Owens, a mother of four young children, was pounding on Lorincz\u2019s door and yelling, leading Lorincz to claim self-defense in shooting her neighbor.",
      "Lorincz told detectives in a videotaped interview that she feared for her life. She also said she had been harassed for most of the three years she had lived in the neighborhood. Jurors who heard the trial evidence did not agree that the shooting was in self-defense.",
      "In a statement to the judge, Lorincz apologized to Owens' family but said she was \u201cliterally terrified\u201d of Owens the night of the shooting.",
      "\u201cI so wish I could go back and change things so she was still here,\u201d Lorincz said. \u201cI never intended to kill anyone.\u201d",
      "Owens\u2019 family pushed for the maximum prison sentence after Lorincz was convicted by an all-white jury. Owens' mother, Pamela Dias, said in court Monday that she now is the sole caregiver of her daughter's four children and that they are deeply traumatized by the killing.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hurting with a pain that will never, never go away,\" Dias said. \"There\u2019s a hole in our heart that will never mend. Susan destroyed our family.\u201d",
      "Lorincz\u2019s attorney, Assistant Public Defender Amanda Sizemore, sought a more lenient sentence, an unspecified term below the 11.5 years in prison that is the lowest for her crime under state guidelines. Sizemore said in court documents that there were several reasons to justify a downward departure, including a mental disorder and claims that Owens was the aggressor and under \u201cextreme duress\u201d during the confrontation.",
      "The judge said such a departure was not warranted, especially considering the impact of their mother's violent death on her children.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll live their whole lives without their mother, which I think is a very significant harm inflicted by Ms. Lorincz,\" Hodges said.",
      "There were protests in the Black community in Ocala when prosecutors took weeks to charge Lorincz with manslaughter, a lesser count than second-degree murder, which carries a potential life prison sentence. Marion County, which includes Ocala, has a Black population of about 12%, according to census figures."

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs",
      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump threatened on Monday to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders.",
      "The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent U.S. Census data.",
      "Trump made the threats in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though southern border apprehensions have been hovering near four-year lows.",
      "\u201cOn January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\" he wrote, complaining that \"thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,\u201d even though violent crime is down from pandemic highs.",
      "He said the new tariffs would remain in place \u201cuntil such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\"",
      "\"Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power,\" he went on, \u201cand until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!\u201d",
      "Trump also turned his ire on China, saying he has \u201chad many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States \u2013 But to no avail.\u201d",
      "\u201cUntil such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America,\u201d he wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether Trump will actually go through with the threats or if he is using them as a negotiating tactic before he returns to the White House in the new year.",
      "Trump\u2019s nominee for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent \u2014 who if confirmed, would be one of several officials responsible for imposing tariffs on other countries \u2014 has on several occasions said tariffs are a means of negotiation.",
      "He wrote in a Fox News op-ed last week, before his nomination, that tariffs are \u201ca useful tool for achieving the president\u2019s foreign policy objectives. Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to U.S. exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.\u201d",
      "Trump won the election in large part due to voter frustration over inflation, but his threatened tariffs pose the risk of pushing prices even higher for food, autos and other goods. If inflationary pressures increase, the Federal Reserve might need to keep its benchmark interest rates higher.",
      "Trump's threats come as arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico have been falling. The most recent U.S. numbers for October show arrests remain near four-year lows, with U.S. Border Patrol making 56,530 arrests in October, less than one third of the tally from October last year.",
      "Meanwhile, arrests for illegally crossing the border from Canada have been rising over the past two years. The Border Patrol made 23,721 arrests between October 2023 and September 2024, compared with 10,021 the previous 12 months. More than 14,000 of those arrested on the Canadian border were Indian \u2014 more than 10 times the number two years ago.",
      "Last week, a jury convicted two men on charges related to human smuggling for their roles in an international operation that led to the deaths of a family of Indian migrants who froze while trying to cross the Canada-U.S. border during a 2022 blizzard.",
      "Much of America\u2019s fentanyl is smuggled from Mexico. Border seizures of the drug rose sharply under President Joe Biden, and U.S. officials tallied about 21,900 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl seized in the 2024 government budget year, compared with 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president.",
      "If Trump were to move forward with the threatened tariffs, the new taxes would pose an enormous challenge for the economies of Canada and Mexico, in particular.",
      "The Canadian dollar weakened sharply in foreign exchange markets immediately following Trump\u2019s post.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, his move to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and reports that he was considering a 25% tariff on the Canadian auto sector were considered an existential threat in Canada. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 75% of Canada\u2019s exports go to the U.S.",
      "The tariffs would also throw into doubt the reliability of the 2020 trade deal brokered in large part by Trump with Canada and Mexico, the USMCA, which replaced NAFTA and is up for review in 2026.",
      "It\u2019s unclear from Trump\u2019s social media post how he would legally apply tariff hikes on those two pivotal U.S. trade partners, but the 2020 deal allows for national security exceptions.",
      "Trump transition team officials did not immediately respond to questions about what authority he would use, what he would need to see to prevent the tariffs from being implemented and how they would impact prices in the U.S.",
      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports just $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most of it comes from one plant in Wisconsin, the home state of then-Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty.",
      "The Canadian government, in a joint statement from Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc, emphasized the close relationship between the two countries and said they will discuss the border and vast economic ties with the incoming administration.",
      "\u201cCanada places the highest priority on border security and the integrity of our shared border. Our relationship today is balanced and mutually beneficial, particularly for American workers,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Freeland, who chairs a special Cabinet committee on Canada-U.S. relations to address concerns about another Trump presidency, has said the president-elect's promise to launch a mass deportation and concern that that could lead to an influx of migrants to Canada, is a top focus of the committee.",
      "A senior Canadian official had said before Trump's posts that Canadian officials were expecting him to issue executive orders on trade and the border as soon as he assumes office. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Foreign Relations Department and Economy Department also had no immediate reaction to Trump\u2019s statements. Normally such weighty issues are handled by the president at her morning press briefings.",
      "Last week, a senior Chinese commerce official said higher tariffs on Chinese exports would backfire by raising prices for consumers. Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen also said China can manage the impact of such \u201cexternal shocks.\"",

      "An Osprey flying as part of the presidential squadron used to ferry White House staff and government officials from an event in New York Monday was grounded due to a safety concern, with one witness reporting flames under the right engine",
      "NEW YORK -- An Osprey being used to ferry White House staff and government officials from an event in New York on Monday was grounded due to a safety concern, with one witness reporting flames under the right engine.",
      "The staff and officials were removed from the aircraft, part of the Marine Corps HMX-1 presidential helicopter fleet, and transferred to a second Osprey to continue their trip accompanying President Joe Biden at a \u201cFriendsgiving\u201d event with members of the U.S. Coast Guard in Staten Island.",
      "The issue caused only a minor delay for Biden\u2019s return to Washington on Monday evening.",
      "The incident occurred the same day lawmakers sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin asking him to re-ground the military\u2019s entire fleet of V-22 Ospreys until solutions can be put in place to address safety and design issues identified by The Associated Press in its recent in-depth investigation of the aircraft\u2019s accident record.",
      "The Marine Corps did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the New York incident. A journalist traveling with the president reported seeing a fire under the right engine shortly before staff were notified the Osprey would be grounded.",
      "It's not the first time White House staff or reporters have had to be removed from an Osprey during a trip due to safety concerns. In November 2023 an Osprey ferrying White House reporters and staff returned to the ground shortly after takeoff after four loud \u201cpops\u201d were heard and smoke was seen.",
      "In the letter sent Monday to Austin, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, and Rep. Richard Neal, all Democrats from Massachusetts, said that \u201cgiven the current concerns about the safety of the V-22, the aircraft should be grounded, and should not be deployed again until the platform\u2019s significant deficiencies are fully addressed.\"",
      "The Osprey, which flies like both a helicopter and an airplane, has been in more than 21 major accidents, many of which can be tied back to choices made in its design, the AP found.",
      "The whole fleet was grounded for three months this year following a deadly crash in Japan in November 2023 that killed eight service members, including one from Massachusetts.",
      "Ospreys, which are operated by the Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps and used in the presidential fleet, have now returned to flight operations, with some restrictions.",
      "Osprey pilots have told the AP they do not want to see the aircraft grounded, despite safety concerns, because of its unique capabilities. Program officials have said they are working on fixes to improve the V-22's safety and reliability.",
      "The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter.",
      "The lawmakers also cited the AP's reporting that pilots are having to push the V-22's \u201cinterim power\u201d feature to be able to land safely \u2014 but are advised against it because it can wear down parts. Interim power was a factor in the most recent accident in October when a Japanese self-defense forces Osprey violently tilted and struck the ground on takeoff. An investigation determined the pilots were to blame for not turning on the interim power during takeoff.",
      "\u201cThe reality for pilots is that they have to push the aircraft to its limits to stay safe,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.",

    "story": [
      "The withdrawal of Matt Gaetz as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general serves as a reminder that the Senate is still relevant when it comes to installing a president\u2019s Cabinet",
      "WASHINGTON -- It's a short phrase in the Constitution, mentioned in passing. But it's already taking on an outsize significance as President-elect Donald Trump charts his return to office.",
      "The withdrawal of Matt Gaetz as Trump's nominee for attorney general dramatically affirmed that the Senate still maintains its \u201cadvice and consent\u201d powers when it comes to vetting and installing a president's Cabinet. Yet it may be only a brief reprieve from the intense struggles to come as Senate Republicans try to preserve their constitutional role.",
      "Trump has been making his Cabinet announcements at a rapid clip, often over social media, and frequently catching GOP senators off guard. Gaetz\u2019s selection on Nov. 13, in particular, left Republicans shocked and momentarily dumbfounded. His withdrawal just over a week later came just as suddenly, leaving many grasping for words.",
      "Within hours, Trump had moved on, announcing on social media that he had selected another loyalist, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, to run the Justice Department. Over the weekend, Trump filled out the rest of his Cabinet selections.",
      "The dizzying speed of the picks has given Trump's second term in office a bracing start, a show of force from a president-elect who has made clear he intends to fill his administration with officials who are willing to upend the ways of Washington. His desire to pack the government with loyalists and wield executive power in expansive ways seems certain to result in frequent clashes with Congress, even with Republicans in control.",
      "\u201cFrom what I\u2019m hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump,\u201d Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said on CBS' \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d",
      "Republican senators are choosing their words carefully as they size up Trump's proposed Cabinet, while also issuing gentle reminders about their role in the confirmation process.",
      "\u201cThe constitutional directive is clear, and it does not change based upon the personalities involved,\u201d said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican. \u201cThe way I approach it, the president has a responsibility to make nominations, and we give him the benefit of the doubt, but we do have a responsibility for \u2018advice and consent.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gaetz's nomination was sunk after Republican senators had privately become wary of a volatile confirmation hearing amid allegations he had sex with an underage girl. As many as four to six GOP senators were signaling their reservations, according to one outgoing Republican senator, Mike Braun of Indiana, though the number was certainly higher.",
      "With Democrats ready to oppose Cabinet nominees they view as unqualified and extreme, Trump's margin for error is narrow. Republicans are set to have a 53-47 majority in the next Senate, so defections from just four Republicans would mean defeat for any nominee that doesn't enjoy bipartisan support.",
      "Other Cabinet picks also face a complicated path to confirmation. Trump's transition team has so far not signed the requisite agreements that allow the FBI to screen his personnel choices, sending nominees before the Senate without the typical vetting that happens beforehand.",
      "So far, Trump's nominees have included for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, a Fox News personality who was accused of sexual assault, which he denies; for secretary for health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has also faced allegations of sexual misconduct as well as concern about his opposition to vaccines; and for national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic House member who has echoed Russian propaganda and talking points.",
      "Those picks fall outside the Republican mainstream and are a notable departure from when Trump entered the White House the first time and mostly chose from the ranks of Republican officials well-respected across Washington.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution gives us a role in personnel called \u2018advice and consent,\u2019\u201d said Sen. Mitch McConnell, the outgoing Senate Republican leader who will remain in office next year. \u201cMy view is that's exactly what will unfold here when these nominees are actually sent forward, and we will treat them like we've treated all others with proper vetting.\u201d",
      "Still, Trump's allies argue that senators need to be ready to confirm the Cabinet, no matter who is chosen.",
      "\u201cThe president deserves to be able to put people in place who will do what he campaigned on, which is to disrupt, and the establishment is concerned, and they probably should be,\" said Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican, adding, \u201cI fully support President Trump's ability to pick his people to go do that.\u201d",
      "After Gaetz's withdrawal, Trump supporters on social media and in activist circles circulated the names of Republicans they believed were holding out support. Charlie Kirk, whose conservative youth organization Turning Points Action worked closely with the Trump campaign, is already organizing a \u201cgrassroots army\u201d to pressure senators to confirm his nominees.",
      "That might not even matter. Trump has also demanded that Senate Republicans agree to allow him to make recess appointments, a process whereby the Senate would adjourn so that Trump could use a constitutional power to make appointments while the chamber is in recess. Sen. John Thune, who will take over as Senate majority leader in January, has kept that option on the table, saying he would be inclined to use it if Democrats try to delay confirmations.",
      "It would be unprecedented in modern times for the Senate to step aside willingly to allow the president to make top-level Cabinet appointments. Experts say it would amount to surrendering the chamber's constitutional power over Cabinet choices.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crystallized the choices for Senate Republicans,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University. \u201cWho is your loyalty to and how far are you willing to put your loyalty to President Trump above your procedural rights and constitutional powers?\u201d",
      "Yet some Trump allies have also discussed a scenario where the Republican-controlled House could vote to adjourn Congress. Even if the Senate declined to adjourn also, that could theoretically create a \u201cdisagreement\u201d between the two chambers, which allows the president to tap a constitutional authority to adjourn Congress until a time he thinks is \u201cproper.\u201d",
      "Still, that constitutional provision has never been tried, and Binder asserted that it would still be within the Senate leaders' ability to promptly call the chamber back into session. But it would also be a further test for the senators.",
      "\u201cA constitutional system doesn\u2019t work unless those in the institutions stand up and fight to maintain their constitutional rights of advice and consent,\u201d said Binder.",

      "Proteus, an autonomous mobile robot that operates on the floor, can move carts around a warehouse. The bipedal, humanoid robot Digit is being tested to help move empty totes with its hands. And there\u2019s also Sequoia, a containerized storage system that can present totes to employees in a way that allows them to avoid stretching or squatting to grab inventory.",
      "Amazon says Robin is currently being used in dozens of warehouses. The others are in a testing stage or haven\u2019t been rolled out widely. But the company says it's already seeing benefits, such as reducing the time it takes to fulfill orders and helping employees avoid repetitive tasks. However, automation also carries drawbacks for workers, who would have to be retrained for new positions if the robots made their roles obsolete.",
      "In October, Amazon held an event at a Nashville, Tennessee, warehouse where the company had integrated some of the robots. The Associated Press spoke with Julie Mitchell, the director of Amazon\u2019s robotic sortation technologies, about where the company hopes to go from here. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: This journey that we\u2019ve been on has taken a couple of years. Luckily for us, we\u2019ve been at this for over a decade. So we have a lot of core technology that we can build on top of.

Less than two years later, we are at scale and shipping 70% of the items in this building through that robotics system.",
      "A: We talk about \u201cbuild, test and scale\u201d and that\u2019s about a two-year cycle for us right now.",
      "A: As you can probably imagine, we have so many items, so it\u2019s an exceptional challenge. We rely on data and putting our first prototype in a real building, where we expose it to all the things we need it to do. Then we drive down all the reasons that it fails. We give it a lot of sample sizes in a very short period of time. For example, a couple of years ago, we launched our Robin robotics arm \u2013 a package manipulation robot \u2013 and we\u2019re at 3 billion picks. So the ability to launch into our network, rapidly collect data, scale and iterate has enabled us to go fast.",
      "The challenge itself can be boiled down to three simple things: you need to perceive the scene, plan your motion and then execute. Today, those are three different parts of our system. Artificial intelligence is going to help us change all of that, and it\u2019s going to be more outcome-driven, like asking it to pick up a bottle of water. We\u2019re on the verge, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m personally excited to be here at the onset of generative AI and use it to dramatically improve the performance of our robotics.",
      "A: With the technology we\u2019ve deployed here, we\u2019re creating new roles for individuals that can acquire new skills to fulfill those roles. And these new skills are not something that is too difficult to achieve. You don\u2019t need an engineering degree, Ph.D. or any really technical skills to support our robotics systems. We designed the systems so they\u2019re easy to service and train on the job to be a reliability maintenance engineer.",
      "We are working backwards from the idea that we want to employ more skilled labor. These opportunities are obviously higher paid than the entry level jobs in our buildings. And partnering with MIT has helped us understand what matters most to our team as we\u2019re deploying these technologies across our network.",
      "A: Not in the adoption. We\u2019re integrating it. But these are complex systems and this is the real world, so things go wrong. For example, we had bad weather due to the storms in the Southeast. When I look at the robotics systems data, I can tell the weather is bad outside because that dramatically affects how the ship dock works.",
      "When trucks don\u2019t arrive on time or when they can\u2019t leave, you see bottlenecks in the building in strange ways. Containers build up, we have to put them in different places, and then humans need to recover them. So communication between what our robotics system is doing and what we need employees in the building to do to recover is important. It's a collaboration of automation and humans to deal with real-world problems. It\u2019s not a matter of having robotics take over but making it one system of humans and robotics working together to accomplish the goal of shipping the product."

      "Scientists who study a critically endangered species of whale that lives off New England say encouraging early signs suggest the animals could have a strong season for feeding and breeding",
      "Scientists who study a critically endangered species of whale that lives off New England said encouraging early signs suggest the animals could have a strong season for feeding and breeding.",
      "The North Atlantic right whale is one of the rarest whale species in the world and it is thought to number about 370. The giant animals migrate, and usually arrive in Cape Cod Bay off Massachusetts early in the winter and stay until around the middle of May.",
      "Scientists with the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Massachusetts, said they observed the first two right whales of the season in the bay on Nov. 18, and the animals are finding abundant food. The scientists said the animals were observed feeding on tiny organisms near the surface of the water, which is a behavior they don't usually exhibit until much later in the season.",
      "Water samples collected in the path of the right whales showed a combination of the microscopic crustaceans the whales love to eat, said Christy Hudak, a researcher with the center. One of the crustaceans is Calanus finmarchicus, an oil-rich species that is critical to whale health, Hudak said.",
      "\"Although Calanus was not the dominant species in the sample, its presence in higher numbers is unusual for this time of year and it will be exciting to see if the food resource this year will prove a banner season for right whales in Cape Cod Bay,\" Hudak said.",
      "The presence of abundant food off New England is the second piece of positive news for the right whales in recent weeks. A group of researchers reported in October that the whale's population increased about 4% from 2020 to 2023.",
      "The whale's population fell by about 25% from 2010 to 2020, raising concerns about potential extinction among scientists and conservationists. Conservationists warned that the species is still in dire need of protection despite recent encouraging signs. The species includes fewer than 70 reproductively active females, which \u201cfurther highlights the urgent need for conservation efforts,\u201d the Clearwater Marine Aquarium said in a statement.",
      "The whales are threatened by entanglement in commercial fishing gear and collisions with large ships. Scientists have said that the warming of the ocean has caused the whales to sometimes stray from protected zones in search of food, and that makes them more vulnerable to those threats.",
      "The whales were abundant off New England generations ago, but they were decimated during the commercial whaling era."

      "\"But there is no doubt here, that in this Budget, business has been milked as the cash cow.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 01:54:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Bills for leaseholders have risen by 44% since 2016. Is Labour's new plan really the solution?",
    "story": [
      "In 2016, Michele McInroy was overjoyed to pick up the keys to her new home - a two-bedroom flat in a refurbished building in Woolwich, south London. But her joy soon soured.",
      "Communal areas were neglected, lifts didn\u2019t work and repairs went unfixed, Michele says. Earlier this year, her service charge increased to around \u00a310,000 a year, marking a 320% rise in five years.",
      "Michele, who works as a civil servant, hopes to move from the capital to Dundee to be closer to her grandson but she is struggling to sell the flat - and believes that the service charge is making it harder still. \u201cI'm losing time that I could be spending with my family that's really precious to me,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cI just feel trapped and there is absolutely nothing I can do.\u201d",
      "Across England and Wales, other homeowners are telling similar stories, as annual service charges have risen significantly. The average is currently \u00a32,321, up 44% since 2016, according to estate agent Hamptons. In London it\u2019s \u00a32,500, marking a 52% increase in the same period.",
      "Others I have spoken to say their service charges have increased by 400-500% in that time.",
      "Among them is Gaz Rahman, whose annual service charge for his flat in the London borough of Tower Hamlets hit \u00a34,654 in 2024, up from \u00a3960 five years earlier. \u201cThere's no accountability,\u201d he argues. \u201cIt just doesn't add up.\u201d",
      "Sue Robertson, who owns a one-bedroom flat in West Sussex, reports that her service charge has shot up by 320% since 2019 - from \u00a3750 to \u00a33,198 a year.",
      "Some leaseholders have opened up about the devastating effect of these costs on their lives - among them are cases of bankruptcy, pressure on relationships and mental health. Sue Robertson tells me that she was hospitalised after attempting suicide. The financial pressure was, she says, a major factor. \u201cEverything just got too much for me.\u201d",
      "For years, politicians have said they planned to address this issue. Then, last week, the current government committed to abolishing leasehold. Housing minister Matthew Pennycook said in a statement that there will be a consultation and white paper early next year - but for some this has come too late.",
      "And the question that remains is, how did it reach a point where the government needed to intervene?",
      "Part of the problem is that this is an archaic system, based on principles dating back to the feudal days of landowners and tenants. Under the current system, leaseholders have to pay charges to a freeholder for services, including the maintenance and repair of communal areas and buildings insurance. Often a managing agent is appointed by the freeholder.",
      "The vague language in the current law adds to the confusion. The law simply states that service charges must be \u201creasonable\u201d and that where costs relate to work or services, they must be of a \u201creasonable\u201d standard.",
      "But campaigners in the field argue that there is another issue at play. They claim unscrupulous freeholders and managing agents are exploiting the system.",
      "\u201cExploitation in broad daylight\u201d",
      "As Sebastian O\u2019Kelly, chief executive of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, puts it: investors cottoned on to the fact they could make money out of the boom in newbuild apartment blocks that have sprung up across the country over the last 25 years.",
      "Previously most freeholders were local authorities or landowners but the boom has led to investors - including venture capital, pension funds and even charities - getting involved. Income from ground rents and lease extensions as well as the rising value of the land itself all make this lucrative.",
      "\u201cWe're talking about a multi-billion pound property sector.\u201d He argues that leaseholders are at the mercy of companies who are \u201cjust there to make money out of them\u201d.",
      "In a recent investigation, the BBC examined about 140 tribunals relating to one London-based firm, Assethold, and discovered that judges have assessed it to have overcharged homeowners by a combined sum of nearly \u00a31.2m. Assethold said it was \"actively reviewing findings from past tribunal decisions\" and had implemented changes where necessary.",
      "But the BBC has seen complaints about other companies accused of overcharging leaseholders too. The problem with policing this is that anyone can buy a freehold and anyone can set themselves up as a managing agent.",
      "\u201cThere are still thousands of people being exploited,\u201d says Sir Peter Bottomley, former Father of the House of Commons and a campaigner against the leasehold system. \u201cThe stories that have come to me in my last 15, 20 years in Parliament would make most people weep.\u201d He says that these include numerous stories of leaseholders being exploited by freeholders.",
      "\u201cAnd it's been happening in broad daylight.\u201d",
      "He also argues that it is \u201coften the young and less well-off who are being lumbered with costs they cannot afford, in ways which are unjustified\u201d.",
      "The Residential Freehold Association (RFA), which represents the largest freeholders in the country, strongly disagrees that the system is \u201cexploitative\u201d, but says it has \u201ccalled for improvements to the home buying and selling process\u201d so that leaseholders understand their obligations.",
      "Questions around transparency",
      "Large newbuild estates and buildings can be complex and expensive to maintain, but a concern among some is the lack of transparency. Leaseholders have complained about hefty bills with little detail or unexplained demands for eye-wateringly high sums.",
      "The Leasehold Advisory Service says that of the 33,000 people have gone to them for advice in the past five years, it has received more complaints about service charges than any other subject.",
      "However, industry insiders argue that there are legitimate reasons for rising charges, including the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the fallout from Brexit.",
      "\u201cWe have seen significant inflation in recent years, as well as extensive material cost increases following the Covid pandemic. This ultimately translates into higher service charges,\u201d the RFA said in a statement.",
      "Jaclyn Mangaroo of the Property Institute, a professional body that represents managing agents in England and Wales, is among those arguing that Brexit triggered an increase in costs. Some say exiting the EU has led to labour shortages in the industry.",
      "Mrs Mangaroo also points out that the Grenfell fire tragedy has seen insurance charges rise, which in turn pushed up service charges.",
      "However her organisation wants managing agents to be regulated to prevent what she calls \u201cabuse\u201d of the system. Its members are properly trained, she stresses, \u201cbut there is no oversight or accountability for those outside the membership, for everybody else that's operating\u201d.",
      "Last week the housing minister has announced they would regulate managing agents but added they need to consult on this first.",
      "Labour's new plans",
      "Abolishing leasehold for flats was not included in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024. Ultimately, the Conservative government ran out of time to get everything it wanted into the legislation before Rishi Sunak called the general election.",
      "The legislation that passed did include some gains for leaseholders, such as giving them more power to buy their freehold. Now, however, certain elements of the previous government\u2019s plans that never made into law will be taken forward by Labour, including making it easier for residents to acquire \u201cthe right to manage\u201d. (In other words, they will still have a freeholder but can take over the management of their building.)",
      "However, the RFA says its studies show that \u201cself-management looks to make no difference\u201d to service charge costs.",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "Starmer will struggle to keep his \u2018smash the gangs\u2019 promise - as I saw firsthand",
      "After Scotland abolished leasehold two decades ago, it introduced the commonhold system where residents own the building and a factor (a type of property agent) maintains the common areas of buildings on their behalf. Unlike managing agents in England, factors must be registered.",
      "Commonhold has been an option in England and Wales since it was introduced under Tony Blair\u2019s government in 2002, but the tenure has not caught on - it applies in only 1% of properties in England and Wales.",
      "Then, last week, Pennycook announced that commonhold would be made \"the default tenure,\" as part of the wider plan to abolish leasehold, but this will all take time to get right. The prime minister reiterated this in a radio interview.",
      "Katie Kendrick, founder of the National Leasehold Campaign (NLC), believes that commonhold is the right way forward. \u201c[It means] the flat owners all have a vested interest in getting best value for money on service charges.\u201d",
      "But the RFA warns that commonhold isn\u2019t a \u201csilver bullet\u201d. Sometimes, not all residents in a building agree to work going ahead, which can slow down repairs or prevent them happening at all, they say.",
      "Fightback from landowners",
      "Whatever happens next, it won\u2019t be easy. Landowners have power and deep pockets and they\u2019re prepared to fight for the land. A group of major freeholders are bringing a legal challenge under the Human Rights Act over proposed changes to the calculation used to compensate landowners when leases are extended.",
      "Henry Hill of the ConservativeHome website is sceptical that any government will ever be able to successfully take on all those with a vested interest in preserving leasehold. \u201cWe're talking tens of billions, hundreds of billions maybe worth of value, unless the government was prepared to try and just take that without compensation, which in our current legal regime would be impossible,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cFormally abolishing leasehold is not going to happen.\u201c",
      "However, Sebastian O\u2019Kelly is hopeful. \u201cLabour needs to get it finished,\u201d he says.",
      "Labour has said it will indeed get it finished and it is \u201cswitching on\u201d some of the legislation that the Conservatives bought in. In addition, they are drafting another bill that will go further.",
      "In the meantime, however, frustration is still growing among many leaseholders, as this all requires more waiting.",
      "And according to Suzanne Muna from the Social Housing Action Campaign (SHAC), \u201cpeople are getting organised\u201d, with members going on service charge strike and refusing to pay soaring bills. It is a risky move, as under lease conditions, it can leave leaseholders at risk of losing their home.",
      "Some, however, have successfully challenged their service charges. Property lawyer Keeley Livingstone, from Essex, says she was able to save \u00a3140,000 for her and her neighbours, after spending more than 100 hours examining their bills and pointing to the freeholder where they had been overcharged.",
      "\u201cThere were a few things on there that just didn't look right,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have a concierge and security. I questioned that because [the bill] was so high, and we don't see half of these people. That was removed - \u00a398,000 worth.\u201d",
      "But others, like Michele, still feel stuck. \u201cI have absolutely no power,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to sell my flat and I cannot.\u201d",
      "She says that Pennycook, who is her local MP, seemed sympathetic to her situation when she and her neighbours raised it with him. Whether he can change their particular situation - and that of thousands of others - remains to be seen.",
      "\u201cI would never buy a leasehold again,\u201d says Michele. \u201cLandlords have too much power. The management company has too much power. It should be equal, and it's not.\u201d",

      "A UK government source told BBC Scotland News there is \"hundreds of millions of pounds\" heading to Holyrood.",
      "However, Robison said more than \u00a3500m would be needed to cover the staff costs of those directly employed by in the public sector, rising to \u00a3750m when indirect employees such as those in childcare, colleges or social care are included.",
      "'Unacceptable'",
      "She told BBC Scotland News: \"This cannot stand.",
      "\"The UK government Treasury will need to think again on this to make sure that Scotland\u2019s public services are fully funded for the employers\u2019 National Insurance contribution and we\u2019ll be pursuing the Treasury very rigorously about this point.\u201d",
      "The UK government is believed to have used the Barnett Formula \u2013 designed to give devolved nations a proportionate share of spending in England \u2013 to reach the \u00a3300m figure.",
      "However, Robison described that total as \"unacceptable\" and \u201cvery low\u201d based on the Scottish government\u2019s projections using the same formula.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t have a situation where the UK Labour government gives resources with the one hand through [Barnett] consequentials but takes away with the other through not fully funding the employers\u2019 National Insurance contributions,\" she said.",
      "SNP had raise fears that they could be short changed because Scotland has a larger public sector when compared proportionally to the UK as a whole.",
      "The finance secretary said it should be viewed as a positive that Scotland proportionally employs more teachers, nurses and police officers and should not be \u201cpunished\u201d for doing so.",

      "Reeves said Scotland would receive \u00a33.4bn in additional funding in 2025-26 when she laid out her tax and spending plans - though this did not include compensation for National Insurance.",
      "The UK government source said the extra \u00a3300m would mean the Scottish government had \"no more excuses\".",
      "They added: \"Scots expect delivery from the SNP and to use this money to reduce NHS waiting times and raise attainment in our schools - not fill in a budget black hole created by years of financial mismanagement and waste.\"",

      "National Insurance contributions are the UK's second-largest revenue stream behind income tax.",
      "It is paid by workers and the self-employed on earnings and profits, and by employers on top of the wages they pay out.",
      "The chancellor increased the rate of employer National Insurance contributions \u2013 from 13.8% to 15% \u2013 and lowered the threshold at which employers have to start paying National Insurance contributions \u2013 from \u00a39,100 to \u00a35,000.",
      "This, of course, applies to public sector employees who work for the Scottish government.",
      "About 600,000 people are employed in Scotland\u2019s public sector, making up 22% of the total workforce \u2013 compared to about 17% in the UK as a whole.",
      "Scotland's public sector is also relatively better paid than the UK workforce.",
      "That fuelled concerns at Holyrood that Scotland would be left short if compensation for the National Insurance increase is not proportional to its public sector.",
      "A Scottish government spokesperson highlighted that in a vote last week the Scottish Parliament had agreed the UK government should reimburse the cost of the change - \"over \u00a3500m\".",

      "The Fraser of Allander Institute, an economics research unit at the University of Strathclyde, has also estimated that the Scottish government will be left about \u00a3500m short as a result of the tax changes.",
      "Director Mairi Spowage said: \u201cYou could say, well, the larger public sector in Scotland, the fact that it\u2019s better paid, that\u2019s sort of down to the decisions of Scottish government.\u201d",

      "He told BBC Scotland News: \u201cOnly an SNP government could pretend that \u00a35bn more money means \u00a3200m less money.",
      "\"I think people would frankly laugh in the face of a government that tries to make such a ridiculous claim.\"",
      "Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay described the National Insurance increase as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and \u201ccounter-productive\u201d.",

      "Energy regulator Ofgem is urging billpayers to shop around as it announced another price rise in January - the second of the winter.",
      "Someone paying by direct debit and using a typical amount of gas and electricity will pay \u00a31,738, or \u00a321 a year more, with bills now over 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "The quarterly cap by regulator Ofgem sets a limit on the cost of each unit of energy, and affects 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "It was always meant to be a backstop, and Ofgem said more options had emerged from suppliers, with a greater choice of fixed-price tariffs for customers.",
      "The best deals are cheaper than tariffs based on the price cap. But, while offering certainty, anyone signing up risks missing out were prices to fall later next year.",
      "Ofgem has admitted that prices are volatile and difficult to predict.",

      "Difficult winter",
      "Energy bills have been high for three years, which charities warn has left many struggling to cope and choosing to go without heating at the coldest time of year.",
      "After two relatively mild winters since energy prices soared, billpayers are braced for a colder period that could stretch their finances.",
      "And over the longer term, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight said high domestic energy prices were likely to be \"the new normal\".",
      "Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the forecasts meant particularly families and people with disabilities faced \u201cimpossible choices\u201d.",
      "\"For bills to remain at this high level... and with an expectation that they'll remain at that level for the foreseeable future, we're just expecting to see people continuing to be really squeezed.\"",
      "The cap means a household bill will typically rise by \u00a31.75 a month.",
      "It is also 10% down on the same period last year, but Ofgem said many billpayers would still be stretched.",
      "\"We understand that the cost of energy remains a challenge for too many households,\" said Tim Jarvis, from the regulator.",
      "\"However, with more tariffs coming into the market, there are ways for customers to bring their bill down so please shop around and look at all the options.\"",
      "What is happening to the energy price cap?",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "What are cold weather payments and who can get them?",
      "Debt building up",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not. So, a long, cold winter could see higher energy use and high bills.",
      "Energy companies say they have put extra support in place to help customers cope with the situation, such as emergency credit, hardship funds or striking off some debts or standing charges.",
      "However a period of high prices - which analysts say is likely to continue - means households have collectively built up debt of \u00a33.7bn to suppliers.",
      "The average household in arrears owes more than \u00a31,500 for electricity and \u00a31,300 for gas.",

      "Winter fuel payment debate",
      "The cap affects those on default, variable tariffs, not those who have fixed a price for a set period.",
      "It is set every three months by Ofgem, although the regulator illustrates the change by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "To estimate the effect on an individual's annual costs, billpayers can add 1.2% to their current bill.",
      "Some households will have less support than last winter because the final cost-of-living payment was made to eight million people on means-tested benefits in February.",
      "For pensioners, the previously universal winter fuel payment, worth up to \u00a3300, is now only being paid only to those on low incomes who receive certain benefits.",
      "According to the government's own estimates, an additional 50,000 pensioners will be living in relative poverty next year as a result of cuts to the payment.",
      "However, this fails to take into account any increased uptake of pension credit - which qualifies people for the winter fuel payment.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the UK was \"exposed to the rollercoaster of global fossil fuel markets\", which was why the government was concentrating on generating power in the UK.",
      "He admitted the latest price rise would \"concern\" many families.",

      "Vueling, the budget arm of British Airways owner IAG, has been fined \u20ac39m (\u00a332m), while Norwegian Airlines and Volotea have been fined \u20ac1.6m (\u00a31.3m) and \u20ac1.2m (\u00a31m) respectively.",
      "The fines were issued because the airlines were found to have provided misleading information and were not transparent with prices, \"which hinders consumers' ability to compare offers\" and make informed decisions, the ministry said.",
      "Ryanair was accused of violating a range of consumer rights, including charging for larger carry-on luggage, seat selection, and asking for \"a disproportionate amount\" to print boarding passes at terminals.",

    "summary": "Scientists in the Caribbean are turning algae that have been choking beaches into biofuel.",
    "story": [
      "When large swathes of invasive seaweed started washing up on Caribbean beaches in 2011, local residents were perplexed.",
      "Soon, mounds of unsightly sargassum \u2013 carried by currents from the Sargasso Sea and linked to climate change \u2013 were carpeting the region\u2019s prized coastlines, repelling holidaymakers with the pungent stench emitted as it rots.",
      "Precisely how to tackle it was a dilemma of unprecedented proportions for the tiny tourism-reliant islands with limited resources.",
      "In 2018, Barbados\u2019 Prime Minister Mia Mottley declared sargassum a national emergency.",
      "Now, a pioneering group of Caribbean scientists and environmentalists hope to turn the tide on the problem by transforming the troublesome algae into a lucrative biofuel.",
      "They recently launched one of the world\u2019s first vehicles powered by bio-compressed natural gas. The innovative fuel source created at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in Barbados also uses wastewater from local rum distilleries, and dung from the island\u2019s indigenous blackbelly sheep which provides the vital anaerobic bacteria.",
      "The team says any car can be converted to run on the gas via a simple and affordable four-hour installation process, using an easily available kit, at a total cost of around $2,500 (\u00a31,940).",
      "Researchers had initially looked into using sugarcane to reduce reliance on costly, imported fossil fuels and help steer the Caribbean towards its ultimate target of zero emissions.",
      "However, despite Barbados being one of few islands still producing sugarcane, the quantity was deemed insufficient for the team\u2019s ambitious goals, explains the project\u2019s founder Dr Legena Henry.",
      "Sargassum on the other hand, she grimaces, is something \u201cwe will never run out of\u201d.",
      "\u201cTourism has suffered a lot from the seaweed; hotels have been spending millions on tackling it. It\u2019s caused a crisis,\u201d Dr Henry, a renewable energy expert and UWI lecturer, continues.",
      "The idea that it could have a valuable purpose was suggested by one of her students, Brittney McKenzie, who had observed the volume of trucks being deployed to transport sargassum from Barbados\u2019 beaches.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d just spent three weeks researching sugarcane. But I looked at Brittney\u2019s face and she was so excited, I couldn\u2019t break her heart,\u201d Dr Henry recalls.",
      "\u201cWe already had rum distillery waste water so we decided to put that with sargassum and see what happened.\u201d",
      "Brittney was tasked with collecting seaweed from beaches and setting up small scale bioreactors to conduct preliminary research.",
      "\u201cWithin just two weeks we got pretty good results,\u201d Brittney tells the BBC. \u201cIt was turning into something even bigger than we initially thought.\u201d",
      "The team filed a patent on their formula and, in 2019, presented their project to potential investors during a side meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York.",
      "Upon touchdown back in Barbados, Dr Henry\u2019s phone was \u201cbuzzing\u201d with messages of congratulation \u2013 including one from US non-profit Blue Chip Foundation offering $100,000 to get the work off the ground.",
      "Biologist Shamika Spencer was hired to experiment with differing amounts of sargassum and waste water to figure out which combination produced the most biogas.",
      "She says she leapt at the chance to take part.",
      "\u201cSargassum has been plaguing the region for several years,\u201d Ms Spencer, who is from Antigua and Barbuda, explains. \u201cI had always wondered about this new seaweed ruining the beaches in Antigua, and when I came to Barbados to study I noticed it here too.\u201d",
      "The algae do not just threaten tourism. They also pose a threat to human health through the hydrogen sulphide they release as they decomposes, along with native wildlife like critically endangered sea turtle hatchlings which get trapped in thick mats of beached seaweed.",
      "Water pollution and warming seas are credited with the upsurge in sargassum, another cataclysmic result of climate change that the Caribbean has done little to contribute to but often bears the brunt of.",
      "Calls for eco reparations from leaders including Barbados' leader Mia Mottley and Antigua\u2019s Prime Minister Gaston Browne have been clamorous in recent years as the region battles ever-rising sea levels and worsening storms.",
      "While waiting for those to bear fruit, this project represents one example of the Caribbean taking its environmental future into its own hands.",
      "\u201cI realised it was important that after removing the sargassum from beaches, it doesn\u2019t just go to landfills,\u201d Ms Spencer continues.",
      "\u201cBy repurposing it in vehicles you protect tourism and prevent people from inhaling it. When we scale up to fuel more vehicles it will require a very large volume.\u201d",
      "Watching the successful test drive of a biogas-charged Nissan Leaf \u2013 supplied by the Caribbean Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \u2013 was utterly exhilarating, smiles Dr Henry.",
      "The MIT-educated mechanical engineer knew she was risking her reputation should the venture fail.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep the night before the test drive event,\u201d she admits. \u201cI was putting my whole life\u2019s work on the line.\u201d",
      "Dr Henry and her husband, career data scientist Nigel Henry, created deep tech firm Rum and Sargassum Inc and are on a mission to change the face of energy production in the Caribbean.",
      "Both are originally from leading oil producer Trinidad, studied in the US and were determined to bring their skills back home.",
      "\u201cMy goal is to help build up this region,\u201d Dr Henry says. \u201cWe are now setting up a four-car pilot to demonstrate real life working prototypes to convince funders that this is workable and scalable.\u201d",
      "She estimates it will cost around $2m to display initial commercial activity and $7.5m to reach the point where the company is able to sell gas to 300 taxis in Barbados.",
      "Potential funders include the US Agency for Internationals Development, the European Union and international development banks through debt financing.",
      "The team plans to expand its work by setting up a biogas station to replace its small existing facility.",

    "story": [
      "Jaguar has urged people to \"trust and reserve judgement\" over the rebrand of the carmaker.",
      "The company, embarking on the biggest change in its 102-year old history, released a new logo and a so-called \"social media tease\" this week, ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand in early December.",
      "The teaser video has faced backlash, with many critics pointing to the fact it doesn't feature an actual car. Others have praised the company for being bold and shaking things up.",
      "Either way, the rebrand has grabbed people's attention and Jaguar has since admitted it not only expected such debate - but it wanted it.",
      "In the 1960s, Jaguar launched the E-Type and XJ which have come to be known among some of the most iconic cars of all time.",
      "Now the company is trying to do the same again by unveiling its new \"design vision\" in Miami next month.",
      "Teasing the vision online, the 30 second advert features models in extravagant, brightly-coloured outfits who reveal the new company logo written as JaGUar.",
      "No cars, no suave men in suits, no big cats.",
      "\"Do you sell cars?\" was the response on X, from owner Elon Musk, who is also the boss of electric car firm Tesla.",
      "\"This is surely a joke?\" added one user, while another suggested the move would \"cost jobs and do real damage\". Some said \"Go woke, go broke\".",
      "Specsavers, known for its humorous social media manner, created a mock-up of its own logo in response, which looked like it had been created on Microsoft Paint.",
      "While supermarket Aldi chipped in at Jaguar's \"Copy Nothing\" slogan with: \"You sound like our legal team.\"",
      "Amid the anger and sarcasm, Jaguar has doubled down on its decision, replying to some posts with phrases such as \"To live is to evolve\".",
      "\"We had to break rules and do something that would get us cut thru,\" a spokesman told the BBC - suggesting this is all part of the plan.",
      "As Martin Brundle, the former Formula 1 racing driver turned broadcaster, put it:  \"I have no idea what this is all about, but it\u2019s genius.",
      "\"Everyone is talking about Jaguar in a moment of time when they\u2019re not actually making cars.\"",
      "'Maybe Jaguar wanted this response'",
      "Lee Rolston is the chief growth officer of global branding agency Jones Knowles Ritchie and has worked on rebrands of household names such as Burger King and the RSPCA.",
      "He was also part of the thinking to famously drop the donuts from Dunkin' to move \"to a first-name basis with America\", given it was also one of the country's the biggest coffee sellers.",
      "He says rebrands occur generally when a company wants to \"shift\" its business strategy, which is what Jaguar is doing in its move to electric-only cars.",
      "In an \"ideal world\" the rebrand leads to buzz and a positive reaction, Mr Rolston adds, but to achieve that you need to \"make sure people understand the context\".",
      "\"Don\u2019t ever just launch a logo - when people see a logo they tend to subjectively respond to it. It\u2019s always good to show as much as you can,\" he explains.",
      "\"Unless you want that response. Maybe Jaguar did actually want this kind of response,\" Mr Rolston ponders.",
      "As a result of Jaguar's rebrand strategy to tease and drip feed information of its plans, a void has been created, and that has been \"filled by opinion\", Mr Rolston says.",
      "\u201cThey have taken a very brave route - it\u2019s one that very, very few brands ever do take because it\u2019s very risky, but time will tell.\"",
      "It's not new to not include a product in an ad or to raise eyebrows - the gorilla beating the drums to Phil Collins didn't feature any Cadbury's chocolate, for example.",
      "Keith Wells, founder and director of brand strategy business Brandwell, points out Apple's \"think different\" advert in 1997 which, rather than showcasing its computers, instead featured the likes of Albert Einstein and Mahatma Gandhi.",
      "However, Mr Wells has first-hand experience of a rebrand backlash. Remember Consignia? (Readers under the age of 40 can be forgiven for not).",
      "In 2001, he led the consultancy Dragon Brands, which came up with the new  corporate name for the Post Office Group. The aim was to create a new, modern umbrella brand for the restructured organisation, which included not just the Post Office, but Royal Mail and Parcelforce too.",
      "But the creation of Consignia led to a backlash from the public, largely due to people misinterpreting the rebrand.",
      "Some people thought Post Office branches would be renamed Consignia, which wasn't the case.",
      "Nonetheless, the negativity, and a new leadership team, eventually led to Consignia being canned, and being renamed Royal Mail plc 16 months later.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:05:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Hi-tech coatings make all sorts of high performance engineering, like jet engines, possible.",
    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

      "Bradford wrote more than 30 further books - again, all bestsellers - amounting to more than 90 million copies bought worldwide and netting her a fortune of more than \u00a3100m.",
      "Although she also wrote about male protagonists, Bradford's speciality was capturing the essence of what it meant to be a strong, determined woman fighting against the odds to succeed.",
      "Barbara Taylor Bradford dies aged 91",
      "Barbara Taylor Bradford dies aged 91",
      "Her stories were dense and epic  - often period family sagas which ran into a book series - full of drama, passion and humanity which consequently made rich material for adaptation.",
      "Several of her novels were turned into TV films or miniseries, many produced by her adored and adoring husband of 55 years, Robert \"the General\" Bradford.",
      "Remarkably, given how prolific she was, Bradford always wrote in long-hand or on an electric typewriter and claimed almost never to have writer's block.",
      "She worked long, dogged hours and described herself to the Guardian as \"stoical and strong\" and with a \"backbone of steel,\" like her heroines.",
      "She added: \"They're all driven, ambitious and disciplined. I've written about myself in every book.\"",
      "Bradford was born in 1933 in a suburb of Leeds and was an only child (her older brother died before she was born) doted on by her mother and father, who was an engineer.",
      "Although the family wasn't wealthy, the young Barbara was pampered and always impeccably turned out. \"I always had a new Whitsuntide bonnet and patent shoes and little white socks,\" she recalled in 2006.",
      "And looking good became very much part of Bradford's larger-than-life adult persona, which was unerringly draped in designer elegance and expensive jewellery. She also developed a keen eye for priceless art.",
      "As for her formation, her mother had high hopes. She encouraged her to read classic literature, such as Dickens and the Brontes, and sent her to private school.",
      "Bradford later fictionalised her parents' marriage in her novel Act of Will. It was dedicated to her mother, who she said \"gave me the greatest gift a mother can give a child, the desire to excel\".",
      "A 2005 biography of Bradford suggested she was indeed descended from lofty stock by way of her mother, who was, it said, the illegitimate daughter of a marquis. Bradford was initially furious at the story, but with time said she'd \"come round\".",
      "Bradford's own writing aspirations began at the age of 10, when her proud mother sent a story her daughter had written to a magazine, and - after it appeared in print, and she was paid for it - she was hooked.",
      "At 15, she joined the Yorkshire Evening Post as a typist, but was soon taken on as a reporter.",
      "\"It was because I was such a bad typist and was ruining so much of their expensive paper!\" she joked. Nevertheless, at 18 she became the newspaper's Woman's Page editor.",
      "By the age of 20, she was a columnist on the London Evening News. \"I was very, very driven from the age of 10. That's what I wanted to be - a reporter,\" she recalled in 2019.",
      "The year 1961 turned out to be significant for Bradford after she was roped into a blind date.",
      "The unknown beau was the rich and successful film producer Robert Bradford. He was \"movie-star gorgeous,\" and it was pretty much love at first sight, she recalled. Two years later they were married and living in New York.",
      "She continued her career in journalism, including covering interior design and lifestyles, before trying her hand at children's and decorating books. But her childhood desire to write grown-up fiction was still bubbling under the surface.",
      "After several failed attempts at suspense novels, Bradford stopped and took stock.",
      "\"I was in my late thirties. I thought: what if I get to 55, and I've never written a novel? I'm going to hate myself. I'm going to be one of those bitter, unfulfilled writers,\" she said in her 2006 Guardian interview.",
      "That's when she embarked on the saga-driven journey that made her name, fortune and shaped her life, selling A Woman of Substance to a publisher on the strength of a 10-page outline and 192 pages.",
      "A Woman of Substance took her two years to write, with the original manuscript running to 1,520 pages. It told the story of Emma Harte, the kitchen maid of a wealthy Yorkshire family, who, through grit and fierce ambition, became the boss of a huge retail empire.",
      "Harte was ruthless but also warm-hearted and fair and readers loved her, making the novel a global best-seller. Realising she'd struck gold, Bradford went on produce six further Emma Harte novels, charting her growth and the lives of her children.",
      "Talking about the story's appeal, Bradford said it had \"everything in it\u2026 drama, intrigue, money, passion, power and revenge - all of those great human emotions that make for a good story\".",
      "\"Woman all over the world told me that Emma Harte was their true role model, and that the book had changed their lives for the better.",
      "\"I had set out to simply tell a good story about a strong woman. I hadn't intended to send a message. But apparently, quite unconsciously I had.",
      "\"All I know is that I wrote the kind of story I love to tell about an ordinary woman who becomes extraordinary in living her life a certain way and goes out to conquer the world.\"",
      "A Woman of Substance was the first of her books to be adapted for TV. It became an Emmy Award-nominated series in 1985, starring Jenny Seagrove, Deborah Kerr and Liam Neeson.",
      "Two other books from the series were also made for TV, Hold the Dream and To Be the Best.",
      "Bradford revelled in her craft, writing at great lengths with novels often stretching to more than 500 pages.",
      "She wrote multiple stand-alone works yet, with often more ideas about her protagonists and their families than would fit into one book, Bradford produced further series, including The Ravenscar trilogy, The Clarendon Chronicles and The House of Falconer.",
      "The Ravenscar Dynasty (one of a trilogy), is set in Edwardian England, and told through the eyes of its handsome, kind but driven hero, Edward Deravenel, who is locked in a vicious battle for the family business.",
      "\"It's very dramatic and it's actually a retelling of the Wars of the Roses, but in modern times. I just took the life of Edward IV and told it in modern terms,\" Bradford explained to the Daily Express, adding she researched how to kill people with poisons, \"so there's quite a lot of deaths.\"",
      "And though the main character is male, the stories also unfailingly follow Bradford's formula of depicting strong, memorable women within the cast, along with another Bradford ingredient - passion.",
      "\"Women always say to me, 'Don't stop writing those nice sex scenes.' But, really, I'm more interested in the protagonist's character,\" Bradford told the Telegraph.",
      "\"So, either she's going to be a wimp, and do nothing, or she's going to be driven and ambitious. Character is what drives everything forward.\"",
      "Accordingly, many of Bradford's novels had motivational titles such as To Be The Best, Everything to Gain and Her Own Rules.",
      "Robert Bradford played a large role in his wife's work and, she said, shepherded her career.  In addition to making screen versions of his wife's stories, he liked to be involved in their promotion.",
      "He was the first person to buy a full-page ad on the back page of the New York Times Arts section.",
      "Robert also loved to buy her gifts, most notably jewellery, no fewer than five pieces a year. She also accumulated countless handbags.",
      "When Robert died after having a stroke in 2019, Bradford was totally devastated.",
      "\"We were everything to each other,\" she said. \"But I have to keep going. Bob always thought I was a strong woman. He liked strong women - never had time for those little fragile blondes.\"",
      "She had auctioned off some pieces of jewellery in 2013 and, following his death and her move into a smaller apartment, Bradford sold more, saying she just didn't have enough room.",
      "Eventually, Bradford found some solace by turning to her most-loved original characters, announcing she was writing a prequel to A Woman of Substance, this time focusing on Emma Harte's great friend Shane \"Blackie\" O'Neill.",
      "Quoted in the press release for the book, Bradford said: \"After my beloved husband, Bob Bradford, died in the summer, Blackie O'Neill came back into my head.",
      "\"Bob was by my side at the beginning when I wrote A Woman of Substance,\" she said, \"and I felt compelled to tell Blackie's story. The true Blackie O'Neill will be revealed and fans of Emma Harte will be able to live his tumultuous life with him.\"",

      "\"I might not always take myself seriously, but I take my work very seriously,\" she said of herself.",
      "And to those aspiring to match her at her art, Bradford cautioned: \"When people say: 'I want to write a novel and be rich and famous like you,' I say: 'Well, you're not going to be.' I say it to shock them. That is the wrong motivation. You should want to do the work so much that nothing else matters. I simply had to write fiction.\""

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 01:34:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Forty years on, the Band Aid song continues to generate debate about the way it presents Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Forty years on from the original recording, the cream of British and Irish pop music past and present are once again asking whether Ethiopians know it is Christmas.",
      "In 1984, responding to horrific images of the famine in northern Ethiopia broadcast on the BBC, musicians Bob Geldof and Midge Ure corralled some of the biggest stars of the era to record a charity song.",
      "The release of the Band Aid single, and the Live Aid concert that followed eight months later, became seminal moments in celebrity fundraising and set a template that many others followed.",
      "Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? is back on Monday with a fresh mix of the four versions of the song that have been issued over the years.",
      "But the chorus of disapproval about the track, its stereotypical representation of an entire continent - describing it as a place \"where nothing ever grows; no rain nor rivers flow\" - and the way that recipients of the aid have been viewed as emaciated, helpless figures, has become louder over time.",
      "\"To say: 'Do they know it\u2019s Christmas?\u2019 is funny, it is insulting,\" says Dawit Giorgis, who in 1984 was the Ethiopian official responsible for getting the message out about what was happening in his country.",
      "His incredulity decades on is obvious in his voice and he remembers how he and his colleagues responded to the song.",
      "\"It was so untrue and so distorted. Ethiopia was a Christian country before England\u2026 we knew Christmas before your ancestors,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "But Mr Dawit has no doubt that the philanthropic response to the BBC film, by British journalist Michael Buerk and Kenyan cameraman Mohamed Amin, saved lives.",
      "As the head of Ethiopia's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission he had managed to smuggle the TV crew into the country. This was despite the government at that time, which was marking 10 years of Marxist rule and fighting a civil war, not wanting news of the famine to get out.",
      "\"The way the British people responded so generously strengthened my faith in humanity,\" he says, speaking from Namibia where he now works.",
      "He praises the \"young and passionate people\" behind Band Aid - describing them as \"amazing\".",
      "His questioning of the song, whilst also recognising its impact, sums up the debate for many who might feel that when lives need to be saved the ends justify the means.",
      "Geldof was typically robust in defending it responding to a recent article in The Conversation about the \"problematic Christmas hit\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a pop song [expletive]\u2026 The same argument has been made many times over the years and elicits the same wearisome response,\"  he is quoted as saying.",
      "\"This little pop song has kept hundreds of thousands if not millions of people alive.\"",
      "He also recognises that Ethiopians celebrate Christmas but says that in 1984 \"ceremonies were abandoned\".",
      "In an email to the BBC, Joe Cannon, the chief financial officer of the Band Aid Trust, said that in the past seven months the charity has given more than \u00a33m ($3.8m) helping as many as 350,000 people through a host of projects in Ethiopia, as well as Sudan, Somaliland and Chad.",
      "He adds that Band Aid\u2019s swift action as a \"first responder\" encourages others to donate where funds are lacking, especially in northern Ethiopia, which is once again emerging from a civil war.",
      "But this is not enough to dampen the disquiet.",
      "In the last week, Ed Sheeran has said he is not happy about his voice from the 2014 recording - made to raise funds for the West African Ebola crisis - being used as his \"understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed\".",
      "He was influenced by British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG, who himself had refused to take part a decade ago.",
      "\"The world has changed but Band Aid hasn\u2019t,\" he told the BBC\u2019s Focus on Africa podcast this week.",
      "\"It\u2019s saying there\u2019s no peace and joy in Africa this Christmas. It\u2019s still saying there\u2019s death in every tear,\" he said referring to the lyrics of the 2014 version.",
      "\"I go to Ghana every Christmas\u2026 every December so we know there\u2019s peace and joy in Africa this Christmas, we know there isn\u2019t death in every tear.\"",
      "Fuse ODG does not deny that there are problems to be resolved but \"Band Aid takes one issue from one country and paints the whole continent with it\".",
      "The way that Africans were portrayed in this and other fundraising efforts had had a direct effect on him, he said.",
      "When growing up \"it was not cool to be African in the UK\u2026 [because of] the way that I looked, people were making fun of me\", the singer said.",
      "Research into the impact of charity fundraisers by British-Nigerian King\u2019s College lecturer Edward Ademolu backs this up.",
      "He himself remembers the short films shot in Africa by Comic Relief, which had been influenced by Band Aid, and that his \"African peers at [a British] primary school would passionately deny their African roots, calling all Africans - with great certainty - smelly, unintelligent and equated them to wild animals\".",
      "Images of dangerously thin Africans became common currency in efforts to elicit funds.",
      "The cover for the original Band Aid single, designed by pop artist Sir Peter Blake, features colourful Christmas scenes contrasted with two gaunt Ethiopian children, in black and white, each eating what looks like a life-saving biscuit.",
      "For part of the poster for the Live Aid concert the following year, Sir Peter used a photograph of the back of an anonymous, naked, skeletal child.",
      "That image was used again in the art work for the 2004 release and it has appeared once more this year.",
      "For many working in the aid sector, as well as academics who study it, there is shock and surprise that the song and its imagery keep coming back.",
      "The umbrella body Bond, which works with more than 300 charities including Christian Aid, Save the Children and Oxfam, has been very critical of the release of the new mix.",
      "\"Initiatives like Band Aid 40 perpetuate outdated narratives, reinforce racism and colonial attitudes that strip people of their dignity and agency,\" Lena Bheeroo, Bond\u2019s head of anti-racism and equity, said in a statement.",
      "Geldof had previously dismissed the idea that Band Aid's work was relying on \"colonial tropes\".",
      "The way that charities raise funds has undergone big changes in recent years.",
      "While remaining critical, Kenyan satirist and writer Patrick Gathara, who often mocks Western views of Africa, agrees things have shifted.",
      "\"There has been a push within humanitarian agencies to start seeing people in a crisis first as human beings and not as victims, and I think that\u2019s a big, big change,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"In the days of Live Aid, all you really had were these images of starvation and suffering\u2026 the idea that these are people were incapable of doing anything for themselves and that was always a misconception.\"",
      "The fallout from the Black Lives Matter protests added impetus to the change that was already happening.",
      "A decade ago, a Norwegian organisation Radi-Aid made it its mission to highlight the way that Africa and Africans were presented in fundraising campaigns using humour.",
      "For example, it co-ordinated a mock campaign to get Africans to send radiators to Norwegians who were supposedly suffering in the cold.",
      "In 2017, Sheeran himself won one of their \"Rusty Radiator\" awards for a film he made for Comic Relief in Liberia in which he offered to pay for some homeless Liberian children to be put up in a hotel room.",
      "The organisers of the awards said \"the video should be less about Ed shouldering the burden alone but rather appealing to the wider world to step in\".",
      "University of East Anglia academic David Girling, who once wrote a report for Radi-Aid, argues that its work is one of the reasons that things have shifted.",
      "More and more charities are introducing ethical guidelines for their campaigns, he says.",
      "\"People have woken up to the damage that can be caused,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Prof Girling\u2019s own research, carried out in Kibera, a slum area in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, showed that campaigns involving and centred on those who are the targets of the charitable assistance could be more effective than the traditional top down efforts.",
      "Many charities are still under pressure to use celebrities to help raise awareness and money. The professor says that some media outlets will not touch a fundraising story unless a celebrity is involved.",
      "But work by his colleague Martin Scott suggests that big stars can often distract from the central message of a campaign. Whereas the celebrity might benefit, the charity and the understanding of the issue that it is working on lose out.",
      "If a Band Aid-type project were to get off the ground now it would have to be centred on African artists, music journalist Christine Ochefu tells the BBC.",
      "\"The landscape for African artists and African music has changed so much that if there was a new release it would need to come from Afrobeats artists or amapiano artists or Afro-pop artists,\" she argues",
      "\"I don\u2019t think people could get away without thinking about the sentiment and imagery associated with the project and it couldn\u2019t continue the saviour narrative that Band Aid had.\"",
      "As King's College academic Dr Ademolu argues: \"Perhaps it's time to abandon the broken record and start anew - a fresh tune where Africa isn\u2019t just a subject, but a co-author, harmonising its own story.\"",

      "Singer Kate Nash says she thinks she will make more money from selling photos of her bottom on OnlyFans than she will from her concerts, after joining the platform because it's \"a really difficult time for artists to tour\".",
      "Under the slogan \"Butts for tour buses\", the musician announced on Thursday that her OnlyFans income will subsidise her shows because \"touring makes losses not profits\".",
      "\"I also think it's bit of a punk protest as a woman to take control of my body and sell it to be able to fund my passion project, which is actually my 18-year career,\" she explained.",

      "She wasn't willing to cut corners or the quality of her shows, she said. \"So that leaves me in a position where I'm not profiting from tours. So is this a job, or is it a passion project?\"",
      "She also said it was \"an important time for women to take control and to feel empowered\", and that she often posted photos of her posterior anyway.",

      "Meanwhile, in recent months, acts including Rachel Chinouriri, Ratboy and The Duke Spirit singer Liela Moss have all cancelled tours, blaming the costs.",
      "Nash highlighted a survey from recording and rehearsal studio network Pirate, which said most artists have not seen an increase in gig fees in recent years despite a rise in ticket prices.",
      "\"Festival prices and ticket prices have gone up drastically, but the musicians' wage hasn't,\" she said.",

      "\"But I was like, 'Let me just give myself a year to learn how to record and produce my own records.",
      "\"From there, if I need to get a job so I can still make music, I'll do that.",
      "\"And then everything happened...\"",
      "Everything, in case you have not been following Gigi's story, involved scoring a global hit single out of nowhere.",
      "Sailor Song, an aching love ballad about falling for a woman who looks like the actress Anne Hathaway, exploded online in June and quickly became a real-world success.",
      "In the UK, it went to number one, ending Sabrina Carpenter's nine-week run at the top.",
      "The song also reached the summit in Ireland and Latvia and made the top 10 everywhere from New Zealand to Belgium.",
      "\"I knew the song was special to me,\" Gigi says.",
      "\"I just didn't know it was going to be special to so many other people.\"",
      "When she found out it had reached number one, \"I got out of the shower and just started crying,\" Gigi told the UK's Official Charts Company.",
      "The success marks a neat conclusion to a messy origin story.",
      "Born in New Jersey and raised in Florida, Gigi was a drama school nerd who turned to music when she realised she was \"never going to be cast in the ingenue role\".",
      "Self-taught on piano and guitar, she went straight to the top of the US streaming charts, in 2021, with her self-released debut single, Sometimes (Backwood).",
      "The song earned her a contract with Interscope Records and Gigi supported Coldplay on their Music of the Spheres tour before she had even played a headline show of her own.",
      "Looking back, she says that initial wave of success created a pressure to expand her career too quickly. For a long time, she felt \"stuck and limited\" by her lack of progression.",
      "\"It was this cognitive dissonance where I\u2019d get an amazing slot [on someone else's tour] but didn\u2019t know who\u2019d be coming to the show,\" Gigi says.",
      "And by the time she played London last November, she knew she had reached breaking point.",
      "\"I asked God, or the universe, 'Open the doors that need to be opened and close the doors that need to be shut,'\" she says.",
      "\"I knew it had to happen - but I was so terrified of what that meant.\"",
      "'Not a democracy'",
      "Interscope released her two days later. But instead of the world ending, Gigi's energy  renewed. She wrote more songs - and taught herself how to produce them, by watching YouTube tutorials.",
      "Sailor Song came to her in a sudden burst of inspiration this February.",
      "\"I was on my bed, my door was open and I was just messing around, jamming,\" Gigi says.",
      "\"My little sister walked by, and she was like, \u2018Gigi, what was that?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I have no idea, but I think it's really cool.'\"",
      "\"There are times where I spend a lot of time thinking about a song and what I want to say. This was one of those times where it just blew out.\"",
      "She teased it on TikTok in April, released it in July - and, as of Wednesday 20 November, it has been streamed 340 million times on Spotify alone.",
      "In some ways, it is an unlikely hit. The production is low-tech and homespun and Gigi's vocals are androgynous to the point where many listeners were surprised to find it was a song about two women in love.",
      "But the chorus is undeniable.",
      "\"Kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor,\" she sings. \"And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavour?\"",
      "Of course, in our terminally divided culture, no success remains untainted for long.",
      "In the US, evangelical Christians criticised Sailor Song for the line: \"I don't believe in God, but you're my saviour.\"",
      "Gigi's response, posted to TikTok, was uncompromising.",
      "\"My songwriting is not a democracy,\" she wrote, \"and that applies to every artist's work.\"",
      "The singer's struggles with faith run deep.",
      "Her parents became born-again Christians when she was in primary school, after which her mother took extra work as a bus driver to pay for Gigi and her sisters to attend a private religious school in Florida.",
      "The experience was not all positive.",
      "\"Growing up gay in an environment where you\u2019re not allowed to be that was very taxing on me,\" Gigi told the Bringin' It Backwards podcast, in 2022.",
      "Her faith was really shaken, however, when her big sister Celene died suddenly, aged 22, in the early months of 2020.",
      "The shock and the pain are unimaginable. The foundations of Gigi's world were destabilised forever.",
      "In her music, she tried to explain the unexplainable.",
      "\"The other day, I thought of something funny/ But no-one would've laughed but you,\" she sang in a song simply called Celene.",
      "\"And Mom and Dad are always crying/ And I wish I knew what to do.\"",
      "Gigi's latest release, Fable, is another attempt to confront that grief, lashing out at  people who feebly offered \"thoughts and prayers\" after her sister's death, and wondering why disconnecting from faith makes her \"skin start to burn\".",
      "\"One of the hardest parts about my grief is that I didn't have any music that touched  on my life, on my situation, to get me through it,\" she says.",
      "\"And so I made it for myself.",
      "\"I've written tons of grief songs but, finally, in Fable, I said it in the way I always felt, from the very day I lost her, and I was so just relieved by the expression of it.\"",
      "That catharsis is a sort of self-healing. And, more than anything, the singer wants her music to find its way to others who need it.",
      "\"One of my biggest wishes is to not let this experience that is so dark and isolating stay that way,\" she says.",
      "\"My hope is that there can be some way this [music] can help. And it's amazing, because I've been seeing a lot of that. It's been very healing for me.\"",
      "And with that ability to reach people in their most vulnerable moments, it won't be long before Gigi sees her name tattooed on many more arms."

    "story": [
      "One was a teenage Sex Pistol who fought the establishment, and the other was an MP and former government minister.",
      "But Glen Matlock and Kevin Brennan bridged the gap from punk to politics by forging an unlikely partnership to protect music venues.",
      "They were part of the campaign which led to a law to safeguard venues under threat from developers.",
      "Matlock is back on the road again, and has spoken about his unexpected friendship with former Cardiff West MP Brennan - now a top aide to Welsh First Minister Eluned Morgan - and their fight to keep music live.",

      "His solo tour includes two shows in Wales, and follows a reunion with fellow Sex Pistols Paul Cook and Steve Jones - although not John Lydon, aka Johnny Rotten, after the famously tempestuous band fell out once again.",
      "The reformed Pistols' shows raised money to help save Cook's local venue in London which was facing closure.",
      "\"Bigger bands shouldn't forget how they came through and if they can help out in some way, they should,\" said Matlock. \"We helped Shepherd's Bush Hall, and it led to the Sex Pistols reforming properly.\"",
      "In the late 1970s the Pistols, as the figureheads of the punk movement, were seen by many as public enemy number one, with their assaults on the music industry, the monarchy - and pretty much everything else.",
      "Now their bassist and main songwriter is focused on ensuring today's bands still have somewhere to play.",
      "\"I was involved with The Musicians' Union,\" he said. \"There was a photocall outside Parliament about the Agent of Change Act, calling for action to protect music venues.",
      "\"Situations like where there's a club and someone builds a block of flats next to it. Then people moan about the noise, when the venue was there first.",
      "\"Whoever changes what is already there is the 'agent of the change' and has to deal with the consequences. Something needed to be done because it was closing down venues around the country.",
      "\"This guy came up to me and said what do you think about this bill? He said: 'I can help - I'm the Labour MP for Cardiff West'. We swapped numbers and I got on the Tube.",
      "\"When I got home and got [phone] reception again, he'd sent me a draft white paper. We had a meeting and he invited me to the House of Commons.\"",
      "Brennan had already backed changes to planning laws to safeguard venues, including a campaign to protect those in Womanby Street in Cardiff.",
      "Brennan said: \"This was an issue I was interested in, so I went over, then realised who it was. I was a big fan of the Sex Pistols and The Clash.",
      "\"Quite a few politicians are into music and a lot of musicians are interested in politics. If people like Bono and Bob Geldof can get involved in politics, why can't politicians get involved with music?",
      "\"The Music Venues Trust tries to prevent the unnecessary closure of grassroots music venues. They come under pressure for all sorts of reasons: bad landlords, complaints about noise or other issues.",
      "\"We did this through a private member's bill in Westminster: The Agent of Change Bill had cross-party support and passed into law.",
      "\"So the principle has been established. But it doesn't mean there aren't still other pressures on venues, from issues like planning to financial viability rates.\"",
      "However, perhaps their friendship was not so unlikely. Brennan, who stood down as an MP in July after 23 years, played in what he called the world's first parliamentary rock band, MP4, and wrote and recorded his own songs.",
      "\"It transpired that Kevin was an accomplished folk musician,\" said Matlock. \"He told me about recording his album and I said 'I can put some bass on it if you like'.\"",
      "Brennan said: \"So I ended up making my little indie folk album The Clown and the Cigarette Girl with a Sex Pistol on bass.",
      "\"We did a launch in Cardiff, a big surprise for the crowd of 150 to see a punk legend at St John's Church in Canton. Then the next night he played with Blondie in front of a few thousand people [in Cardiff].",
      "\"He's a musician\u2019s musician - he just loves to play.",
      "\"I never thought when I became a MP I'd end up playing in a band with a Sex Pistol. Funny how things turn out!\"",
      "Matlock praised Brennan as a \"very good folk musician\" and \"one of the few people in Parliament\" who had talked about the effects of Brexit on touring musicians.",
      "The Pistols' bassist said there was now \"a realisation Brexit hasn't been good for touring musicians. There's been a huge knock-on effect, not just for musicians, but for trucking companies, catering workers, lighting guys. There has to be a better way through it.",
      "\"People like [The Who singer] Roger Daltrey and Johnny Rotten were pro-Brexit. But when they realised it would affect them they signed a petition to try to say we've got to have special rights.\"",
      "He added: \"I haven't spoken to John directly about this, but he knows what I think.\u201d",
      "For his part, Daltrey said in 2021 that he still supported Brexit, but wished the Conservative government at the time had \"made the easing of restrictions for musicians and actors a higher priority\".",
      "On his latest tour, Matlock is purposely picking venues in smaller towns that do not often feature on tour schedules.",
      "So he plays The Tivoli in Buckley, Flintshire, on Thursday, 21 November, and Clwb Crown in Merthyr on Friday 29 November.",
      "The Merthyr date brings flashbacks to a gig the Pistols played a few miles away in Caerphilly almost 48 years ago at the height of their notoriety.",
      "In December 1976 the band had just sworn on teatime TV and many shows on their Anarchy in the UK tour were banned. But although the Caerphilly gig went ahead, they were met by a large group of singing Christians, who picketed fans as they went in, which featured in the Pistols' film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.",
      "Matlock said: \"The show was rescheduled from the Anarchy tour. Things got big in the meantime, we went back a few weeks later and there were people saying we were calling up the devil and kids would go to hell if they went to the gig.",
      "\"It was cold and pouring with rain, we were inside and they were all out getting wet. One of the local councillors in more recent years admitted it was all a bit daft, really. Good publicity at the time, though.\"",
      "By next year, Matlock will have been performing live for 50 years, and has no intention of slowing down. He has played with bands like Blondie, The Faces, and Primal Scream as well as the recently reformed Pistols, has written two books about his life in music, and his latest solo LP is Consequences Coming.",
      "He said: \"I still write protest songs. I think consequences have been coming for a long time for some our more self-centred politicians. I still have so much to say.\"",
      "Matlock added: \"I never used to think past the end of the week when I was a teenager. But collectively with the Sex Pistols we really had something.",

    "summary": "The adaptation of Broadway show Wicked has a star-studded cast of Ariana Grande and Jeff Goldblum.",
    "story": [
      "Ariana Grande has told the BBC that she channelled her personal feelings of loss when filming Wicked.",
      "\"Losing someone you love is something we've all unfortunately had to experience - and sometimes we have the privilege to say goodbye and sometimes we don't,\" she says.",
      "Grande, 31, plays Galinda Upland in the film, which is an adaptation of the hugely successful stage musical exploring the Wizard of Oz universe from the perspective of two witches.",
      "The two-time Grammy award winner has suffered personal tragedy in recent years, after the 2017 Manchester bombing of her concert and the death of her former partner Mac Miller a year later.",
      "She says appearing in Wicked, one of the first Broadway shows she saw as a child, \"feels like a homecoming\".",
      "\"This music has always brought such comfort and now being able to spend time with it and be trusted with it is the privilege of a lifetime.\"",
      "In the weeks running up to the film's release, the close relationship between Grande and co-star Cynthia Erivo has been in the spotlight.",
      "\"From the moment we were cast, Cynthia invited me over and we hung out for five hours and we laughed and we cried and got to know each other.",
      "\"We had a real conversation right off the bat about creating a safe space for each other and being honest with each other,\" she says.",
      "Grande and Erivo's characters begin in the Oz universe as university students, before later becoming enemies as Glinda the Good Witch and Elphaba the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "Erivo, 37, has described her role as \"a real honour\" and nods to the foundations formed by the original stage actors Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel, who she calls \"the architects\".",
      "\"We've been handed something really special and it's a dream come true and truly big shoes to fill,\" she adds.",
      "Mixed reviews",
      "Critics have so far given the film mixed reviews. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw praised the \"sugar-rush fantasy\" and awarded four stars, describing Wicked as a \"blast of entertainment power\".",
      "There was another four-star review from Empire's Helen O'Hara, who said director Jon M Chu \"uses every bell and whistle possible to turn the stage show into a movie epic\".",
      "However, in a two-star review, the Telegraph's Robbie Collin described Wicked as \"utterly exhausting and hopelessly miscast\", adding that there was \"no conceivable artistic argument\" to have split the the Broadway show into two films.",
      "The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey awarded three stars and questioned the way it was shot, with characters often \"aggressively backlit\".",
      "\"Jon M Chu treats his Oz as if it were as mundane as a city block,\" she added.",
      "But Screen Daily's Fionnuala Halligan concluded: \"It\u2019s so doggedly faithful to the show, so emphatically orchestrated and so powered by Cynthia Erivo's exceptional performance, that resistance to its 169 minutes of theme park magic becomes futile.\"",
      "Erivo, who received a best actress nomination at the Oscars for her portrayal of Harriet Tubman in the biopic Harriet in 2019, is also a decorated stage performer who received a Tony Award in 2016 for the Broadway adaptation of The Color Purple.",
      "She says she was able to draw on her own experiences of struggling with acceptance for the role of Elphaba, who is outcast for her green exterior.",
      "\"Whether you feel 'other', or you feel different from everyone else, I think both of us have experience in those spaces that we have used to infuse our characters,\" she says.",
      "Wicked, which first came to Broadway in 2003, has gone on to be the third-highest grossing theatre show in the world, behind The Lion King and The Phantom of the Opera.",
      "Many have pinned its enduring success with audiences on the relatability of its content - from Elphaba's struggle with self-identity to Glinda's difficulty in making moral choices.",
      "Its reimagining for the big screen also stars Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage as the voice of Doctor Dillamond - who is an animated goat.",
      "Oscar nominee Jeff Goldblum appears as the Wizard of Oz and British star Jonathan Bailey - who has received international recognition in recent years after starring in Netflix hit Bridgerton - as Fiyero.",
      "Goldblum says the central themes of the film, which include embracing diversity, were important to the cast, who were able to \"come together to work and appreciate each other with empathy, compassion and love\".",
      "Bailey also says everyone he worked with had their own \"Elphaba story\", adding \"we have at points in our lives felt different\".",
      "He says: \"In this film particularly, it's the superpower of individuality which becomes a power to harness.",
      "\"I think it's really important right now as well, this theme that there's more that unites us than divides us.\"",
      "The musical has been a West End and Broadway institution for more than 20 years, but Chu says the central themes of the plot are more relevant than ever.",
      "\"Elphaba says something has changed within me, something's not the same - and that's the line that really got me into this movie, I felt like we all feel uneasy,\" he says.",
      "Chu, who also directed Crazy Rich Asians in 2018, says he received the script for the film during the pandemic, which made him think about how the film could reflect his real-life experience of looking for truth in a confusing time.",
      "He says the cast also made themselves \"emotionally available\" during filming and were able to put themselves personally in the shoes of their characters.",
      "\"Ariana, Cynthia and Jeff were talking about the real-world stakes of what we were putting into these characters,\" he adds.",
      "\"It wasn't just about global politics, it was more personal than that.",
      "\"We were all going through stuff in our own lives and I think they were generous to offer that up within the roles of Glinda, Elphaba and the Wizard.\"",

    "story": [
      "At 31 years old, I was told by doctors that if I didn\u2019t stop drinking alcohol, I could die.",
      "I was shocked because I didn\u2019t drink every day, I never drank alone and I drank because I enjoyed it as a social activity, not because I felt alcohol-dependent.",
      "But by definition, my alcohol consumption from my late teens to late 20s would be considered binge drinking. It felt normal because people around me were doing the same - and now it was catching up with me.",
      "I\u2019d recently become a mum and had gone to the GP because I felt tired all the time. This led to blood tests and a liver function check.",
      "Further tests revealed I had severe alcohol-related liver fibrosis, or extreme scarring on my liver, most likely because of my drinking habits.",
      "I trundled home from the hospital in a daze, with my daughter in her pram. This might have happened to me, I thought, but I could not be the only one.",
      "I wanted to know what this said about the UK\u2019s drinking culture and began looking into it for BBC Panorama.",
      "Alcohol-specific deaths are at their highest levels in the UK since records began in 2001.",
      "While the problem is undoubtedly bigger in men - particularly older men - more women under the age of 45 are dying due to alcohol-related liver disease, or ARLD, than ever before, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures from 2001-22.",
      "If we binge a given amount of alcohol in one go - for example on a night out - it can be much more damaging than if we drink the same amount over a longer period.",
      "The latest research, by a team at University College London and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, suggests bingeing may be up to four times as damaging for the liver.",
      "When we think of binge drinking, we tend to imagine people drunkenly sprawling out of bars and falling over at bus stops. But actually,  a binge can be less alcohol than you might think.",
      "In the UK, a binge is considered as drinking six or more units of alcohol in one sitting for women, and eight or more for men. That is two large glasses of wine for a woman.",
      "At King's College Hospital in London, consultant hepatologist Debbie Shawcross tells me that she regularly treats professional women in their 40s and 50s with liver disease.",
      "\u201cThey're spinning plates in the air, and maybe they have young families,\u201d she says. \u201cThey're not alcoholics... but they are just drinking too much as a habit.\u201d",
      "I\u2019m not in my 40s yet, but she could have been describing me.",
      "When I was younger, I would easily drink more than what\u2019s defined as a binge on a night out. I didn\u2019t think anything of it until I got my diagnosis.",
      "After my blood tests came back as abnormal I was sent to Glasgow\u2019s New Victoria Hospital, where I had an ultrasound, and finally a fibroscan. All this took place over the course of about a year.",
      "A fibroscan is a type of non-invasive ultrasound which measures liver stiffness. A reading of seven kPA (a unit used to measure the level of oxygen in the blood) or below is considered normal. My reading was 10.2.",
      "This indicated severe scarring - if it had not been caught, and if I had not stopped drinking, it could have developed into cirrhosis.",
      "I received my diagnosis in February 2024. My consultant, Dr Shouren Datta, said if I abstained from alcohol, then there was a possibility that my fibrosis could be reversed.",
      "I feel extremely lucky that the problem was picked up in time for me to try to do something about it.",
      "Doctors had discovered the problem while investigating my tiredness.",
      "However, part of the problem with liver disease is that there are often no initial symptoms.",
      "Seven in 10 people with end-stage liver disease don\u2019t know anything about it until they are admitted to hospital with symptoms such as jaundice, fluid retention and abnormal bleeding.",
      "That is what happened to Emma Jones, 39, originally from north Wales. I met her 15 months after her successful liver transplant.",
      "Like me, Emma was a social drinker, with a successful career and vibrant social life. But during the Covid lockdowns things spiralled for her - at the worst point, she was drinking three bottles of wine a day.",

    "summary": "A toxic row has engulfed the NHS, say ministers. So why have doctors turned on physician associates?",
    "story": [
      "Julia\u2019s first four years as a physician associate were everything she hoped they would be. After working in the NHS for the best part of a decade in a non-patient facing role, she was delighted to be on the wards supporting doctors and the wider healthcare teams.",
      "\u201cI loved the contact I had with patients, assessing them and playing a part in their care. I felt supported and part of a team.\u201d",
      "That all changed about a year ago.",
      "\u201cSuddenly we came under attack. Doctors in the radiology department started refusing to talk to me about scans and others have been saying we don\u2019t deserve to get paid what we do.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere has totally changed. We\u2019ve even stopped going into the canteen as we were being made to feel uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "'Destructive situation'",
      "Julia is far from alone. United Medical Associate Professionals (UMAPs), a body which represents physician (PAs) and anaesthesia associate (AAs), says there are countless examples like this with staff facing bullying and being sidelined.",
      "The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents senior doctors in the NHS, has warned the whole situation has become so \u201cdestructive\u201d that it is damaging teamwork across hospitals and GP surgeries where PAs and AAs work.",
      "It has cited the particularly acrimonious debate on social media, which has seen regular attacks about the pay and professionalism of PAs and AAs as well as discussions about how they can be undermined in the workplace.",
      "This week the Health Secretary Wes Streeting decided he needed to act, ordering a review into PAs and AAs in England to resolve what he said had become a \u201ctoxic\u201d row.",
      "So how has it come to this, with doctors turning against the very people brought in to support them?",
      "The PA role is hardly new in the NHS \u2013 it has been around for 20 years, helping doctors by doing tasks such as taking medical histories and carrying out examinations.",
      "What has changed is the speed at which they are being recruited \u2013 over the last seven years the numbers have gone from a few hundred to 3,500 currently with a target of 12,000, including AAs, by 2036.",
      "'More of a hindrance than a help'",
      "As the numbers have been increasing doctors have become concerned the lines between professions are getting blurred.",
      "Sam is five years into his training and works alongside PAs in a hospital in the south west. \u201cThey are more of a hindrance than a help,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re being placed on rotas instead of doctors \u2013 but there are things they cannot do so doctors end up having to double up.",
      "\u201cAnd for those doctors at the very start of training having PAs on a ward can actually limit their exposure to some of the medical tasks that should be part of their learning. We\u2019ve had enough.\u201d",
      "The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), is so concerned it now wants the rollout to be paused while the review takes place.",
      "It says PAs and AAs, who need to complete a two-year master\u2019s following a first degree, which is normally bioscience-related, are being asked to do tasks they are not meant to and filling in for doctors. It argues this is putting patients at risk.",
      "To back up its claims, it points to two high-profile cases where patients \u2013 Emily Chesterton and Susan Pollitt - died after being seen by PAs.",
      "Alongside this, the BMA also cites a survey published last year of 18,000 of its members, which found nearly nine in 10 of those that responded felt the way AAs and PAs currently work in the NHS always or sometimes posed a risk to patient safety.",
      "BMA deputy council leader Dr Emma Runswick says: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing PAs doing things, such as ordering scans they are not qualified to order and prescribing drugs that they aren't qualified to prescribe.",
      "\"And when they see patients it\u2019s not always clear to the patient that they are not being seen by a doctor. It\u2019s dangerous and has got to stop.\u201d",
      "The union is calling for a strict set of rules to be drawn up limiting what they can and cannot do. The BMA\u2019s plan would essentially restrict their role to assistants \u2013 helping with ward rounds, taking bloods and chasing up on scan results and making discharge arrangements.",
      "But UMAPs chief Stephen Nash says: \u201cIt\u2019s not about patient safety, but about protecting their interests. They want us to be subservient.\u201d",
      "He says the deaths like those reported are \u201cabsolute tragedies\u201d, but he has concerns about how they are being used to attack a whole profession.",
      "\u201cThere is meant to be a no-blame approach to learning the lessons from failures.\u201d",
      "He says when mistakes are made there are often multiple factors at play, but the campaign against PAs and AAs has meant their role has been singled out. \u201cIt misleads the public,\" he adds.",
      "In the end it will be up to the independent review, which is being led by Royal Society of Medicine president Prof Gillian Leng, to establish the truth on this.",
      "Key will be the NHS England database on patient safety incidents, which services across the country report into.",
      "The data for the past year is not publicly available, but a senior NHS source told me: \u201cThe key here is not whether PAs are making mistakes \u2013 everyone in the NHS does, doctors included \u2013 but whether they are making more mistakes and causing more safety incidents than you would expect.",
      "\"The reports are complex and nuanced quite often, but there\u2019s nothing in there that immediately rings alarm bells.\u201d",
      "This is not just a row that has been played out on the wards of hospitals and consulting rooms of GP surgeries, it has stretched to the highest echelons of the world of medicine.",
      "While the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has remained broadly supportive of the rollout of PAs and AAs, a number of the 23 individual colleges it represents have been engulfed by infighting over the issue, leading to resignations.",
      "'Relationships damaged permanently'",
      "The Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of GPs (RCGP) and Royal College of Anaesthetists have all recently moved towards opposition.",
      "One source close to what has been happening at the royal colleges says: \u201cThere have been some huge rows \u2013 I fear relationships have been damaged permanently. As royal colleges we were always traditionally above the politics of trade unionism.",
      "\u201cThere is a group of doctors that see PAs and AAs as a threat \u2013 we saw the same when nurses took on extra responsibility years ago.\u201d",
      "The lawyers have also been brought in with UMAPs considering action against the RCGP, believing its opposition has cost some PAs their jobs.",
      "And the BMA has already launched a legal case against the General Medical Council, which next month is due to start regulating PAs and AAs. The union does not want the same body responsible for regulating doctors to do the same for PAs and AAs, believing it will blur the lines even further.",
      "What is clear is that this dispute will not be easy to resolve.",
      "And in the meantime, the staff on the frontline are being left to muddle on.",
      "\u201cPAs and AAs are worried every time they go into work,\u201d says Mr Nash. \u201cA very powerful lobby within the medical profession has turned against them. It\u2019s a really horrible time.\u201d"

      "Medical notes written at the time stated Suzie was not suitable for a transfer to intensive care due to a pre-existing heart condition and having Down's syndrome. Her father, John, told an earlier session of the inquiry she was \u201cleft to die\u201d because of her disability.",
      "Mr Hancock accepted that a bed in intensive care could not be found for every individual patient who needed it at the height of the pandemic.",
      "\u201cOf course there was enormous pressure, and of course, it has consequences,\u201d he said.",
      "He said, at times, staff ratios had to be stretched, meaning specialist critical care nurses had to look after six patients rather than give the one-to-one care they would in normal times.",
      "But he added: \u201cWhat we successfully avoided, was an overall rationing - to say, 'people, according to these characteristics, aren\u2019t going to be cared for'.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what would have happened if we had let the virus get more out of control.",
      "\u201cDid people get as good care as they would have done in normal times? Of course not. There was a pandemic,\u201d he told the inquiry.",
      "Asked about the imposed visiting restrictions, which meant some relatives could not be with dying family members in their final hours, and elsewhere, expectant fathers could not attend ante-natal scans, he said \u201con balance\u201d he believed the government got the rules \u201cabout right\u201d.",
      "\u201cWhere I think we got it wrong, for instance, was the way that the funeral guidance was applied on the ground - it wasn\u2019t as had been intended.\u201d",
      "Other witnesses, including the first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, and Scotland\u2019s former health minister Jeane Freeman, have suggested some of those restrictions, or they way they were implemented, might have gone too far.",
      "Mr Hancock also defended the government\u2019s 'Stay Home, Save Lives, Protect the NHS' messaging, saying that it was \u201cliterally true\u201d that \u201cif we didn\u2019t stop the spread of the virus, the NHS would be overwhelmed\u201d.",
      "Giving evidence recently, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, said, with hindsight, the authorities did not suceed in letting the public know the NHS was still open for non-Covid patients during the pandemic.",
      "Mr Hancock alluded to how he had had to \u201cruffle some feathers\u201d to protect the NHS from political interference.",
      "He said he felt it was his job to \u201cshield\u201d the health service from \u201cpeople being difficult in Number 10\u201d.",
      "Some of the interference by political appointees in Downing Street caused \u201cincredible difficulties\u201d when it came to rolling out Covid testing, he added."

    "story": [
      "The assisted dying bill has been defended by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall who told the BBC it was about the \"right to choose\".",
      "She refused to criticise Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood, who wrote to her constituents this weekend saying the proposed changes would create a \u201cslippery slope to death on demand\u201d.",
      "Kendall told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg she believed the bill would give people \"power, choice and control\" over their own deaths.",
      "The bill, which would allow some terminally ill people to have a medically assisted death, is to be debated by MPs on Friday.",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "'I might be dead before a decision is made': Terminally ill people on assisted dying",
      "No pressure on MPs over assisted dying vote, says PM",
      "Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Kendall said: \"I think you should have the right to choose.",
      "\"The point is not that this is for everybody.\"",
      "Kendall, who is a long-time advocate of assisted dying, called the debate on the bill part of a \u201cbigger\u201d national discussion as more people \"have longer deaths\".",
      "Her comments came as 29 faith leaders representing Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus and Sikhs signed an open letter warning the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, would lead to people being pressured into ending their lives to avoid burdening families or the NHS.",
      "MPs will get a free vote on Friday on the bill - introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater - meaning they can follow their conscience rather than party orders.",
      "Public opinion shows a majority support of changing the law, with the latest YouGov poll, showing 73% of Britons support allowing assisted dying in principle.",
      "Campaigning for both sides continues in the run-up to Friday's vote, which will be the first public expression of MPs' support.",
      "Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme he wanted to see more debate on the issues.",
      "\"People want to know what the evidence is for the scale of the challenge,\" he said.",
      "Brown is a longstanding critic of assisted dying and urged MPs to vote against changes saying: \"I see life as a gift - I see it as something to be valued.\"",
      "Mahmood joined Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson who have already said that they would vote against the bill.",
      "Care Minister Stephen Kinnock expressed his support for the bill, while Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer backed assisted dying proposals the last time they were debated by MPs in 2015. This time round he has said he will not pressurise Labour MPs either way.",
      "Campaigners supporting the bill, including broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen, argue terminally ill people should get a choice over how they die to avoid unnecessary suffering.",
      "Dame Esther, who revealed last year she had joined Dignitas after a terminal cancer diagnosis, described the new bill as \u201cwonderful\u201d.",
      "In her letter, Mahmood said the most significant risk of introducing assisted dying is \"the pressure the elderly, vulnerable, sick or disabled may place upon themselves\" to end their lives sooner.",
      "She said she was \"profoundly concerned\" by the legislation, not just for religious reasons but because it could create a \"slippery slope towards death on demand\" and argued the government must \u201cprotect and preserve life, not take it away\u201d.",
      "Mahmood added that scandals like Hillsborough, infected blood and the Post Office Horizon \"reminded us that the state and those acting on its behalf are not always benign\".",
      "Speaking to Sky News, Leadbeater said she had no doubts \"whatsoever\" her proposed bill was the right thing to do.",
      "Current laws are \"failing\" causing families to lose loved ones in \"harrowing circumstances\" and leaving people to endure \"painful deaths\", she said.",
      "\"By creating a legal framework, we will improve the situation,\" she added.",
      "The divide on the assisted dying bill has not split neatly down party lines. Conservative shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake told the BBC he plans to back the bill.",
      "Hollinrake argued he and others \"would like that choice\" at the end of their lives and he did not \"think it\u2019s right for the state to prevent them\".",
      "While acknowledging other ministers concerns, he said he trusted Parliament to keep checks in place to protect the system.",
      "Veteran broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby rejected fears of a \"slippery slope\" on assisted dying, citing Oregon in the US - which introduced similar laws 27 years ago without expanding them further.",
      "Appearing on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg panel, Dimbleby said he backed the bill and had been influenced by the experience of his brother Nicholas who died of motor neurone disease.",
      "However former culture secretary Nadine Dorries said she was against the bill and called for more palliative care.",
      "She said she was \"forever grateful\" her late husband had changed his mind about taking his own life after a terminal bowl cancer diagnosis, allowing him to have \"the best four months\" with his family before dying.",
      "Broadcaster Piers Morgan meanwhile told the panel he felt conflicted but urged for more hospice funding to ensure peaceful deaths for the terminally ill."

      "Kennedy \u201cwill help make America healthy again by shaking up HHS and FDA\u201d, Colorado\u2019s Democratic Governor Jared Polis wrote on social media this week, welcoming his nomination. After receiving public backlash for praising him, Polis qualified his endorsement, writing on social media that \"science must remain THE cornerstone of our nation\u2019s health policy\".",
      "Making America Healthy Again",
      "Leading up to the election, Kennedy - a former Democrat - offered several ideas for tackling chronic diseases under his slogan \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d.",
      "He has frequently advocated for eliminating ultra-processed foods - products altered to include added fats, starches and sugars, like frozen pizzas, crisps and sugary breakfast cereals, that are linked to health problems like cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.",
      "He has taken aim primarily at school lunches, telling Fox News: \u201cWe have a generation of kids who are swimming around in a toxic soup right now.\"",
      "Part of Kennedy's new mandate will include overseeing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has over 18,000 employees.",
      "The agency is in charge of ensuring the safety of pharmaceuticals and the US food supply, but has come under fire in recent years from some lawmakers and consumer groups, who have accused it of a lack of transparency and action on food safety.",
      "The 70-year-old has pledged to take a sledgehammer to the agency, and fire employees he says are part of a \"corrupt system\".",
      "\u201cThere are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA \u2026 that have to go, that are not doing their job,\u201d Kennedy told MSNBC this month.",
      "He has also pushed for getting rid of food dyes, including Red No. 3, and other additives banned in other countries.",
      "The former Democrat has also singled out more controversial health issues, including fluoride in drinking water, which he says should be banned altogether, and raw milk, which he believes has health benefits despite the increased risk of bacterial contamination.",
      "He\u2019s also come after seed oils, writing on social media that Americans are being \u201cunknowingly poisoned\u201d by products like canola and sunflower oil that are used in fast foods.",
      "What the evidence says",
      "Several public health experts stand behind Kennedy\u2019s goal to tackle ultra-processed food, which they say the US eats at much higher rates than many other countries.",
      "\u201cIt is just thrilling to hear somebody argue for doing something about chronic disease,\u201d Ms Nestle said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s aim to get rid of certain food additives and dyes also could be beneficial, said Dr Peter Lurie, executive director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit group that advocates for food safety.",
      "The former FDA official said several food dyes, including Red No. 3 - which is banned in California - should also be blocked by the US government because of concerns about carcinogens.",
      "The FDA has pushed back on Kennedy\u2019s claim that the US allows thousands of additives that are banned in the European Union. A spokesperson said it was necessary \"to dig deeper and understand the context behind the numbers\" when comparing regulations in the US and EU, which use different methodologies.",
      "But public health experts and former officials said a number of Kennedy\u2019s goals were not worthwhile - and in some cases, harmful.",
      "For instance, drinking raw milk that has not been pasteurized - a process that helps kill bacteria - can make people sick or even kill them, research has found.",
      "\u201cThere's no evidence of any nutritional benefit of any magnitude that we know that comes from non-pasteurizing of milk,\u201d said Dr Lurie.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water also could be problematic, because fluoride, in the low levels found in water, has been proven to improve dental health, said University of Michigan nutritional sciences professor Jennifer Garner.",
      "Removing it from the water supply would also be out of his jurisdiction, because fluoride levels are controlled by states.",
      "And his claim that seed oils are helping drive the obesity epidemic is not based in science, either, Dr Lurie said.",
      "\u201cWe see no evidence for that. In fact, they seem like important products to the extent that they substitute for saturated fats\u201d such as butter, he said.",
      "Taking on Big Food",
      "Food reforms, while long part of the public health conversation, could also simply be unrealistic both politically and bureaucratically, some experts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal more complicated than he lets on,\u201d said Dr Lurie. \u201cThese are real challenges, and you will encounter industry opposition at every turn.\u201d",
      "For one, the FDA does not have authority over the catch-all of \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d, several former officials told the BBC.",
      "Instead, they said, the process is more complicated. Both the US Department of Agriculture and the FDA regulate the food industry. The FDA does not make the rules - it carries out policies passed by Congress and works to limit unhealthy foods by enforcing limits and labelling on certain nutrients, like sodium and saturated fat.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments \u201cmake for great political rhetoric\u201d, Ms Garner said. \u201cIn my view, I don\u2019t see how that could be feasible without drastic changes in other policy and infrastructure.\u201d",
      "He will also face industry backlash for proposals to ban pesticides and genetically modified organisms commonly used by American farmers, former FDA officials said.",
      "\u201cThe businesses will complain,\u201d said Rosalie Lijinsky, a former FDA official of 33 years.",
      "The industry is used to limited oversight from both Democrats and Republicans - including under Trump's first term - while many of Kennedy\u2019s goals would involve even more rulemaking.",
      "Several food industry groups met with lawmakers before Kennedy\u2019s appointment this month to lobby against him, Politico reported last month.",
      "Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, said this week that he planned to meet Kennedy before his confirmation hearing and \u201cspend a lot of time educating him about agriculture\u201d.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s position also puts him at odds with President-elect Trump, a longtime lover of fast food who worked to roll back stricter health requirements for school lunches during his first term.",
      "\u201cYou get some ideas that make a certain amount of sense, but they are exactly the kind to which this administration is hostile,\u201d Dr Lurie said.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Food Industry Association, which represents food retailers, producers and manufacturers, like General Mills, said it looked forward to working with Trump\u2019s team to \u201censure food and drug policy continues to be grounded in science, to reduce regulatory complexity\u201d.",
      "The industry complaints about Kennedy\u2019s agenda do not come as a surprise, said Jeff Hutt, a spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee, which is urging Republican lawmakers to confirm Kennedy.",
      "The goal of the health movement, Mr Hutt said, is \u201cprioritising the wellness of America over corporate profits\u201d.",
      "\u201cEven if the idea of banning ultra-processed food is not possible politically, it's a conversation that we need to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Pathway to change",
      "Kennedy still could work within existing US regulatory frameworks to improve America\u2019s food systems, former officials said.",
      "Ms Nestle said Kennedy could take on ultra-processed foods by altering the US Dietary Guidelines, which set nutritional standards for the industry and federal government programmes, including school lunches and military meals.",
      "\u201cThey have an enormous impact on the food industry,\u201d Ms Nestle said. \u201cThat would make a big difference.\u201d",
      "The guidelines are updated every five years by the US Department of Agriculture and DHHS, which has previously said there is not enough evidence against ultra-processed foods.",
      "Still, officials and nutrition experts raised concerns about the means by which Kennedy has proposed to enact his agenda, including firing the FDA\u2019s nutritionists.",
      "The move would have large ramifications for food safety, said Ms Lijinsky. \u201cIf you lose your top experts, you\u2019re going to have problems,\u201d she said.",
      "Ultimately, Ms Garner said it is difficult to disentangle some of Kennedy\u2019s more reasonable food-improvement goals with the false health claims he has spread.",
      "\u201cThere's an opportunity here,\u201d Ms Garner said.",

      "Diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2021, Cassandra Wardle is one of the women launching a group action against the biggest seller of talcum powder, Johnson & Johnson (J&J).",
      "Cassandra, who stumbled on a Facebook article linking cancer and talc following her diagnosis, said it was used on her as a baby and she continued to use it \"for 20 years or more\".",
      "\"You mimic your mum who used it,\" she said. \"Baby powder was supposed to be something deemed 'safe to use', even on a baby's bum.\"",
      "If it proceeds, the legal action would be the first of its kind brought against the pharmaceutical multinational in the UK.",
      "With 1,900 potential claimants, including cancer patients, survivors and families, lawyers say it is set to be the largest pharmaceutical product group action in English and Welsh legal history.",
      "The BBC has spoken to a number of women with gynaecological cancers - many are part of the group action - who believe their repeated use of talcum powder played a part in their diagnosis.",
      "Their lawyers allege that for decades, talcum powder was contaminated with cancer-causing asbestos - something they claim J&J was aware of but sought to suppress.",
      "J&J denies suppressing any information and denies any links between its baby powder, asbestos and cancer.",
      "\"The doctors said the cancer was unusual for my age at 44,\" says Cassandra, from Alfreton in Derbyshire.",
      "She says she would regularly use talcum powder after a bath or as a deodoriser, including across her genitals.",
      "\"I was just starting my chemo journey when I read about the links, but I felt enraged that a corporate giant like J&J could seem to do this,\" she says.",
      "At first, doctors believed Cassandra's cancer was terminal.",
      "\"I went to the consultation alone,\" she says. \"So I had to come home and tell my husband what they said, tell my parents they would be burying me.",
      "\"I closed down my business unit and laid off staff.",
      "\"I even created a not-so-creative acronym: 'LAC - Life After Cass'.\"",
      "Then, she had an unexpected lifeline. Chemotherapy had in fact triggered an autoimmune condition, giving the impression of late-stage cancer.",
      "Cassandra survived. But the disease still had a devastating effect on her life.",
      "She was forced to give up her business, and an infection during chemotherapy damaged her vocal cords, reducing her voice to a whisper. A hysterectomy to remove cancerous tissue had a huge impact on her body.",
      "\"I was plunged into surgical menopause,\" she says.",
      "\"I would have liked children. I was never blessed that way, but my last ability to have children was taken away due to cancer.\"",
      "Are there links between talcum powder and cancer?",
      "The claims of links between talcum powder and cancer revolve around asbestos - a known carcinogen.",
      "Talc is a mineral that is sometimes used in talcum powders and other cosmetic products, according to Cancer Research UK.",
      "Sophia Lowes, from the charity, said: \"[Talc] can be mined in places where there is asbestos, which can cause the talc to become contaminated. Asbestos is known to cause mesothelioma and cancers of the lung, larynx and ovary.",
      "\"The sale of products containing asbestos is banned in the UK and cosmetic products need to be safety-tested before they can be sold.\"",
      "Many documents were hidden from public view until Americans with cancer began suing the firm.",
      "J&J has been accused of knowing decades ago that its baby powder could contain contaminants of asbestos.",
      "J&J has previously said that \"any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false\".",
      "The company discontinued mineral-based talc in North America in 2020 - and followed suit in the UK last year - replacing it with cornstarch. J&J said this was due to financial pressures and a \"misinformation campaign\" around the product.",
      "While the focus of the group action is on the contamination of talc with asbestos, in July this year the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that mineral talc itself was \"probably carcinogenic for humans\".",
      "Deborah, who did not want to be identified by her real name, also lives in Derbyshire, and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 29, just two weeks after she and her husband had started trying for a baby.",
      "\"I used talcum powder for years as a teenager,\" she says.",
      "\"Literally all I had was some stabbing pain on a Sunday night. I went to the doctor and was sent for an ultrasound on the Tuesday.\"",
      "During the scan, a tumour was found on Deborah's ovary. A few days later she had an operation, at which point doctors told her there was a risk the cancer had spread to her womb.",
      "\"Within two weeks of the first symptoms, I'd had a full hysterectomy,\" she says.",
      "\"I went from excitedly planning for a baby to having all of my parts removed.\"",
      "Deborah's diagnosis was 30 years ago, and she and her husband ultimately went on to adopt.",
      "But she still feels angry that she was robbed of the chance to conceive naturally.",
      "\"If [J&J] knew, they shouldn't have been doing it,\" she says.",
      "KP Law, representing the claimants, has begun the process of litigation, which is expected to start at the beginning of 2025.",
      "In the US, the firm has been sued by more than 62,000 people and at least $13bn has been paid out or set aside in response to the action.",
      "Cases there have seen the company found liable for mesothelioma - an asbestos-specific cancer - and gynaecological cancers women suffered after using talc, with billions of dollars awarded in damages.",
      "'Entirely transparent'",
      "Tom Longstaff, a partner at KP Law, says: \"The case has been litigated repeatedly in the American judicial system but women in the UK deserve an answer, and compensation, here.",
      "\"Asbestos cancers tend to have a latency of around 10 to 40 years. So we are walking into a wave of women reaching an age where asbestos cancers develop.\"",
      "Mr Longstaff's firm sent a pre-action letter to J&J in September, a necessary step before starting proceedings. If the case goes ahead, it would likely end up in court next year.",
      "In response, Erik Haas - worldwide vice-president of litigation for Johnson & Johnson, said the allegations against the company \"defy logic, rewrite history and ignore the facts\".",

      "Labour MP Kim Leadbeater has introduced the bill, saying it could prevent harrowing deaths, following a long campaign by supporters of the position, including Esther Rantzen, who believe the law needs to be changed.",
      "Brown told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme that \"people want to know what the evidence is for the scale of the challenge\", and called for more debate on the issue.",
      "'I might be dead before a decision is made': Terminally ill people on assisted dying",
      "Assisted dying could lead to coercion - Streeting",
      "No pressure on MPs over assisted dying vote, says PM",
      "Brown stood down as MP in 2015 so will not get a vote but his voice still carries weight in the Labour Party.",
      "MPs will get a free vote on Friday, meaning they can follow their conscience rather than party orders.",
      "Brown joins health secretary Wes Streeting, justice secretary Shabana Mahmood and the two longest-serving MPs in the Commons in speaking out against the bill - although many MPs' views remain unknown.",
      "In an opinion column for the Guardian on Friday, Brown writes of the death of his first daughter, Jennifer Jane, aged only 11 days, and how this strengthened his belief \"this is not the right time to make such a profound decision\".",
      "\"The experience of sitting with a fatally ill baby girl did not convince me of the case for assisted dying; it convinced me of the value and imperative of good end-of-life care,\" he said.",
      "Calling for a commission on palliative care, Brown acknowledged that both sides in the assisted dying debate share a common concern and \"genuine compassion felt for all those suffering painful deaths\".",
      "But with \"the NHS still at its lowest ebb\", he said \"we need to show we can do better at assisted living before deciding whether to legislate on ways to die\".",
      "He added: \"An assisted dying law, however well intended, would alter society\u2019s attitude towards elderly, seriously ill and disabled people, even if only subliminally, and I also fear the caring professions would lose something irreplaceable \u2013 their position as exclusively caregivers.",
      "\"Add to that the slippery slope with lawmakers, undoubtedly out of compassion, finding the erosion of safeguards and the extension of eligibility hard to resist.\"",
      "In his interview with the BBC's Sunday programme, Brown echoed many of the points raised in the opinion column, and called for citizens' assemblies - where a group is brought together to learn about and discuss a particular issue - to help peoples' understanding.",
      "\"People want to know what the evidence is for the scale of the challenge,\" he told host Julie Etchingham, adding: \"I don't think we\u2019ve had this debate in full, in this country yet.\"",
      "Brown is a longstanding critic of assisted dying, and in a 2008 interview with the Archbishop of Westminster told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme he was \"totally against laws\" allowing assisted suicide or euthanasia, saying they could put vulnerable people under pressure.",
      "In the BBC interview, Brown also spoke about how his faith has informed his life and beliefs, saying: \"I see life as a gift. I see it as something to be valued.\"",
      "He added that while religious views came into his stance on the issue, \"it's important to put the secular argument that people can understand - that it is possible to avoid so much of the pain that people are experiencing and we haven\u2019t invested enough in doing that\".",
      "MPs last considered the issue of assisted dying in parliament in 2015, after Brown had stepped down as an MP, when plans to change the law were overwhelmingly rejected.",
      "Public opinion shows a majority support of changing the law, with the latest YouGov poll showing 73% of Britons support allowing assisted dying in principle.",
      "Campaigning for both sides continues in the run-up to Friday's vote, which will be the first public expression of MPs' support.",
      "With a week to go for minds to change and hundreds of new MPs who have never put their views on the record, the result is difficult to predict, although there are some indications it could be close.",
      "Responding to the opinion column, Leadbeater said she was moved by Brown's words and agreed on the need for better palliative care - but she stressed the decision on Friday was not a case of one or the other.",
      "\"I was deeply touched by Gordon Brown's description of how he and Sarah surrounded their new-born daughter with love as her life slipped away,\" she said.",
      "\"I know how hard it is to talk about loss but it's important that we have these conversations.",
      "\"He says that baby Jennifer's death convinced him of the value of good end-of-life care and I agree with him completely.\"",
      "Britain already has \"probably the best palliative care in the world\", she said, stressing that her bill also includes the need for a government report on the availability and quality of palliative care.",
      "She said: \"He [Brown] and I agree on very many things but we don\u2019t agree on this.",
      "\"Only legislation by parliament can put right what Sir Keir Starmer calls the 'injustice that we have trapped within our current arrangement'.",
      "\"The need to address the inability of the current law to provide people with safeguards against coercion and the choice of a better death, and to protect their loved ones from possible prosecution, cannot wait.\""

      "\"There aren't many farms year on year that are sold in excess of that amount, and therefore that threshold is high,\" he said.",
      "Sir Keir denied claims on Radio Bristol that he was on the side of farmers or small business owners, or \"for keeping millions of pensioners warm\".",

    "summary": "Government claims have been hotly contested by farmers, and the BBC has been scrutinised for its analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Since the government unveiled its new inheritance tax plans for farmers in last month\u2019s Budget, there has been intense debate about how many people will be affected and to what extent.",
      "Many of the claims from the government have been hotly contested by farmers, and BBC Verify has come under scrutiny over some of the figures it has relied on to try to establish the number of farms impacted by the change.",
      "The debate has revolved around estimates provided by farmers\u2019 groups, including that the new tax could \"harm\" up to 70,000 farms over time.",
      "Our analysis found that the figure was likely to be somewhere closer to the number provided by the government - about 500 estates per year. That remains our assessment.",
      "Farmers' groups say the changes have been \u201cbuilt on bad data\u201d. The government says it wants to make the inheritance tax system fairer and discourage wealthy people from investing in land solely to avoid the tax.",
      "Here, we go through all the numbers and examine the claims and counter-claims.",
      "What are the contested figures?",
      "Under the government\u2019s plans, from April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be subject to inheritance tax at 20%.",
      "The Country Land and Business Association (CLA) has estimated that the tax change  \u201ccould harm\u201d 70,000 UK farms. This would represent roughly 33% of the 209,000 UK farms, as identified by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra).",
      "The CLA figure is not an annual one and, clearly, a farm would only be potentially subject to inheritance tax if it was passed on, following a death.",
      "The government, in trying to assess the impact of its tax change, looked instead at recent figures for the number of actual claims for tax relief for agricultural estates.",
      "At this point, it\u2019s worth stressing that an agricultural estate is not the same as a landed estate, or farm: an \u201cestate\u201d is a legal term for the value of the money, property and possessions an individual passes on upon their death. In this case, it\u2019s an estate that includes some agricultural land.",
      "The Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has claimed up to about 520 inherited agricultural estates a year \u201cwill be impacted to some extent by these changes\u201d.",
      "The Environment Secretary Steve Reed has said \"three quarters of farmers will pay nothing as a result of the changes\u201d.",
      "But farming groups continue to dispute the government figures, with the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) pointing to other figures from Defra which it says \u201cshow that only 34% of farms are under \u00a31 million net worth\u201d. This would imply that around two thirds of farms could potentially be affected by the Budget tax change.",
      "The NFU has also released analysis which it says shows that \u201caround 75% of commercial family farms will be above the \u00a31 million threshold\u201d.",
      "Below, we look into the challenges when it comes to reaching an exact conclusion on the numbers affected, and provide more detail on which figures are more reliable - and explain why.",
      "Is Defra data more accurate?",
      "Farming groups have partially based their arguments against the tax change on data from Defra\u2019s Farm Business Survey, which shows the net worth of farms in England in 2022/23.",
      "The figures suggest that 17% of farms in England have a net worth - the difference between their assets and liabilities - of between \u00a31m and \u00a31.49m. Another 49% of farms have a value of \u00a31.5m and over.",
      "This suggests, on the face of it, that 66% of farms in England could potentially be affected by the tax changes.",
      "However there are some problems with this calculation, as the data from the Defra survey is not necessarily representative of the overall UK-wide farming sector.",
      "The survey - which is based on a sample of just over 1,350 farms  - states that it is designed to be representative of only about half of the farms in England (rather than the rest of the UK) and also excludes farms which bring in little revenue.",
      "Moreover, the Defra data shows estimates of individual farm values, but does not show their ownership.",
      "Multiple farms can be owned by a single person who then lets them out to tenants. In England about 46% of agricultural holdings were wholly or partially rented out to tenant farmers in 2023 according to Defra data. If the owner of multiple farms sought to pass on those farms upon his or her death, this would all show up in a single estate in the inheritance tax relief claim.",
      "The financial impact would be on that individual\u2019s inheritance tax bill, not each farm.",
      "A farm could also be jointly owned by multiple people. If, for example, five people owned a \u00a35m farm they could each pass on their \u00a31m share without their estates having to pay any inheritance tax.",
      "This is why it is more appropriate to use tax data on inheritance relief, rather than farm survey data, to estimate the impact of the change in the Budget on individuals.",
      "Does including business property relief change the picture?",
      "Another challenge is that some initial government calculations of the number of estates likely to be affected only referred to Agricultural Property Relief (APR) and not Business Property Relief (BPR).",
      "APR relates mainly to the value of land. BPR can include a farm's machinery and livestock, which can also make up a significant proportion of the value of an agricultural estate.",
      "It is true that both APR and BPR relief will be capped at a combined \u00a31m for inheritance tax purposes, meaning a single estate will be able to claim no more than \u00a31m in these combined reliefs.",
      "Farming groups have claimed that farmers often also use BPR so any calculation of the impact of the tax changes based solely on APR claims will not capture the full effect on farming estates.",
      "Thousands of farmers protest against inheritance tax changes",
      "Thousands of farmers protest against inheritance tax changes",
      "However, the government has now published figures based on HMRC inheritance tax data which incorporate historical APR and BPR relief claims, and should capture those agricultural estates making use of both reliefs.",
      "These figures suggest that while taking BPR into account as well as APR does push up the number and proportion of estates likely to be affected, it does not fundamentally change the picture.",
      "The data shows that in 2021-22 the number of estates making combined APR and BPR claims where the value of the estate was more than \u00a31.5m was 383, or 22% of all claims.",
      "The number of estates worth more than \u00a31.5m making APR claims solely was 278, or 16% of the total.",
      "Why is it \u00a31.5m and not \u00a31m?",
      "The government\u2019s latest figures break down the impact using the threshold of \u00a31.5m, not \u00a31m, explaining to BBC Verify that this was chosen based on the assumption that an individual estate\u2019s standard inheritance tax reliefs of \u00a3500,000 would be added to their new \u00a31m allowance.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury and HMRC for a breakdown of the figures using \u00a31m as a threshold - which would be consistent with its original calculations showing APR claims only - but it said it hasn't collated those figures.",
      "The CenTax think tank has studied the impact of APR and BPR reliefs.",
      "CenTax\u2019s co-director Arun Advani argues that the government\u2019s estimates of the number of agricultural estates likely to be affected by the capping of both reliefs at \u00a31m combined - up to 520 estates a year - seems reasonable.",
      "\u201cThe data on historic claims are a much more reliable guide to the number of affected estates than surveys of farm sizes,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhile the government's reforms are certainly likely to be difficult for some farmers, particularly given the many other factors weighing down farmer's incomes, numbers claiming tens of thousands will be affected aren't consistent with the evidence.\u201d",
      "David Sturrock from the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies also said that the Treasury\u2019s figures were \u201ccredible\u201d and added that including the impact of capping BPR \u201cdoesn\u2019t radically change the picture in terms of estates affected\u201d.",
      "The NFU has pointed out that if 500 estates were affected per year that could amount to 15,000 over 30 years - but this would still be some way short of the 70,000 figure.",
      "Should small estates be excluded from calculations?",
      "The NFU argues that many estates included in the government figures are too small to be considered working farms.",
      "Its case is simple - if you were to exclude these small farms, the percentage of real, working farms affected would be much higher.",
      "It has pointed to separate APR inheritance tax relief claims data from HMRC, via the Treasury, which breaks down estates by size.",
      "This shows that in 2021-22, 474 claims (27% of the 1,730 total) were for estates valued between \u00a30 and \u00a3250,000, and that 398 (23% of the total) were for estates valued at between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000.",
      "\u201cVery few viable farms are worth under \u00a31m,\u201d says the NFU president Tom Bradshaw.",
      "That's a reasonable argument.",
      "If estates with a value below \u00a3500,000 were excluded from the APR figures, the share of the total affected each year would automatically rise from the 27% implied by the government\u2019s initial calculations.",
      "The NFU\u2019s analysis suggests only including what it categorises as \u201cworking farms\u201d would increase the share affected from 27% to 49%.",
      "However, the estimated absolute number of affected estates - roughly 500 in each year - would not be affected by that change.",
      "Is there a \u00a33m allowance?",
      "A key question is where the effective financial inheritance tax threshold for estates with agricultural assets kicks in.",
      "Farming groups have suggested the value of any inherited estate with agricultural assets over \u00a31m will be impacted.",
      "This is understandable as this was the threshold figure cited in the Budget.",
      "However, the government has since claimed that the effective threshold for many farmers\u2019 estates to pay inheritance tax could be not \u00a31m, but \u00a33m, because of various inheritance tax reliefs available to estates.",
      "A higher effective threshold would have a major impact on the proportion and number of estates affected.",
      "The government\u2019s claim is based on the fact that the estates of farmers, like the estates of everyone else subject to inheritance tax, are eligible for a standard tax-free allowance, known as a nil-rate band, of \u00a3325,000.",
      "They are are also eligible for the residential nil-rate band of \u00a3175,000. The latter is available to people who are passing on a main residence to a direct descendant, such as children or grandchildren, as part of their estate. Together these two allowances total \u00a3500,000.",
      "This is on top of the \u00a31m tax-free allowance for agricultural estates.",
      "It\u2019s not just the \u00a31.5m allowance for a single individual - for anyone married their spouse has a similar effective allowance. Adding these together - and allowing for the ability of farming couples to share their allowances - does create a potential for some farming estates to pass on \u00a33m entirely free of inheritance tax.",
      "However, importantly, this could only be achieved if each partner passed on \u00a31.5m of their total assets at death sequentially, rather than in one \u00a33m estate upon the death of the second partner.",
      "The ability of estates to push up the threshold to \u00a33m will also depend on individual circumstances. Of course, not every farmer is married, and some might not be passing on a main residence.",
      "However, it\u2019s legitimate to assume that many farming estates would be able to use these allowances, which are used by the rest of the population.",
      "Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that a farming estate can be affected by this inheritance tax change, without the estate necessarily ending up paying more money in tax, because of the need for individuals to spend more time planning their tax arrangements than they did before.",

      "The quarterly cap by regulator Ofgem sets a limit on the cost of each unit of energy, and affects 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "It was always meant to be a backstop, and Ofgem said more options had emerged from suppliers, with a greater choice of fixed-price tariffs for customers.",
      "The best deals are cheaper than tariffs based on the price cap. But, while offering certainty, anyone signing up risks missing out were prices to fall later next year.",
      "Ofgem has admitted that prices are volatile and difficult to predict.",

      "Difficult winter",
      "Energy bills have been high for three years, which charities warn has left many struggling to cope and choosing to go without heating at the coldest time of year.",
      "After two relatively mild winters since energy prices soared, billpayers are braced for a colder period that could stretch their finances.",
      "And over the longer term, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight said high domestic energy prices were likely to be \"the new normal\".",
      "Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the forecasts meant particularly families and people with disabilities faced \u201cimpossible choices\u201d.",
      "\"For bills to remain at this high level... and with an expectation that they'll remain at that level for the foreseeable future, we're just expecting to see people continuing to be really squeezed.\"",
      "The cap means a household bill will typically rise by \u00a31.75 a month.",
      "It is also 10% down on the same period last year, but Ofgem said many billpayers would still be stretched.",
      "\"We understand that the cost of energy remains a challenge for too many households,\" said Tim Jarvis, from the regulator.",
      "\"However, with more tariffs coming into the market, there are ways for customers to bring their bill down so please shop around and look at all the options.\"",
      "What is happening to the energy price cap?",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "What are cold weather payments and who can get them?",
      "Debt building up",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not. So, a long, cold winter could see higher energy use and high bills.",
      "Energy companies say they have put extra support in place to help customers cope with the situation, such as emergency credit, hardship funds or striking off some debts or standing charges.",
      "However a period of high prices - which analysts say is likely to continue - means households have collectively built up debt of \u00a33.7bn to suppliers.",

      "To estimate the effect on an individual's annual costs, billpayers can add 1.2% to their current bill.",
      "Some households will have less support than last winter because the final cost-of-living payment was made to eight million people on means-tested benefits in February.",
      "For pensioners, the previously universal winter fuel payment, worth up to \u00a3300, is now only being paid only to those on low incomes who receive certain benefits.",
      "According to the government's own estimates, an additional 50,000 pensioners will be living in relative poverty next year as a result of cuts to the payment.",
      "However, this fails to take into account any increased uptake of pension credit - which qualifies people for the winter fuel payment.",

      "The borrowing figures are the first to be released since Chancellor Rachel Reeves' first Budget last month, which outlined higher spending and increased taxes.",

      "Brennan had already backed changes to planning laws to safeguard venues, including a campaign to protect those in Womanby Street in Cardiff.",
      "Brennan said: \"This was an issue I was interested in, so I went over, then realised who it was. I was a big fan of the Sex Pistols and The Clash.",
      "\"Quite a few politicians are into music and a lot of musicians are interested in politics. If people like Bono and Bob Geldof can get involved in politics, why can't politicians get involved with music?",

      "\"We did this through a private member's bill in Westminster: The Agent of Change Bill had cross-party support and passed into law.",
      "\"So the principle has been established. But it doesn't mean there aren't still other pressures on venues, from issues like planning to financial viability rates.\"",
      "However, perhaps their friendship was not so unlikely. Brennan, who stood down as an MP in July after 23 years, played in what he called the world's first parliamentary rock band, MP4, and wrote and recorded his own songs.",
      "\"It transpired that Kevin was an accomplished folk musician,\" said Matlock. \"He told me about recording his album and I said 'I can put some bass on it if you like'.\"",
      "Brennan said: \"So I ended up making my little indie folk album The Clown and the Cigarette Girl with a Sex Pistol on bass.",

      "The Pistols' bassist said there was now \"a realisation Brexit hasn't been good for touring musicians. There's been a huge knock-on effect, not just for musicians, but for trucking companies, catering workers, lighting guys. There has to be a better way through it.",
      "\"People like [The Who singer] Roger Daltrey and Johnny Rotten were pro-Brexit. But when they realised it would affect them they signed a petition to try to say we've got to have special rights.\"",
      "He added: \"I haven't spoken to John directly about this, but he knows what I think.\u201d",

      "On his latest tour, Matlock is purposely picking venues in smaller towns that do not often feature on tour schedules.",
      "So he plays The Tivoli in Buckley, Flintshire, on Thursday, 21 November, and Clwb Crown in Merthyr on Friday 29 November.",
      "The Merthyr date brings flashbacks to a gig the Pistols played a few miles away in Caerphilly almost 48 years ago at the height of their notoriety.",
      "In December 1976 the band had just sworn on teatime TV and many shows on their Anarchy in the UK tour were banned. But although the Caerphilly gig went ahead, they were met by a large group of singing Christians, who picketed fans as they went in, which featured in the Pistols' film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.",

      "By next year, Matlock will have been performing live for 50 years, and has no intention of slowing down. He has played with bands like Blondie, The Faces, and Primal Scream as well as the recently reformed Pistols, has written two books about his life in music, and his latest solo LP is Consequences Coming.",

      "After all, this was the week the Kremlin leader lowered the threshold for the use of Russian nuclear weapons.",
      "It was the week the US and UK crossed (another) Putin red line, allowing Ukraine to fire Western-supplied longer-range missiles into Russia.",
      "It was also the week that President Putin, in effect, threatened the UK, America and any other country supplying Ukraine with such weapons and for such a purpose.",
      "\u201cWe consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against the military facilities of those countries that allow their weapons to be used against our facilities,\u201d the Russian leader said in an address to the nation on Thursday evening.",
      "So, you can see: \u201cWhat will Vladimir Putin do next?\u201d is a most pressing question. And, since I\u2019m the BBC\u2019s Russia Editor, you might expect me to have the answer.",

      "Embracing escalation",
      "This week the Kremlin accused the \u201ccollective West\u201d of escalating the war in Ukraine.",
      "But nearly three years of war in Ukraine have shown that it is Vladimir Putin who embraces escalation as a means to achieving his goals - in this case, control over Ukraine or at the very least peace on Russia\u2019s terms.",
      "Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, his decision to declare four Ukrainian territories part of Russia, his deployment of North Korean troops to Kursk region, his decision on Thursday to target the Ukrainian city of Dnipro with a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile, followed up by threats to strike the West - all of these represent moments of escalation in this conflict.",
      "I once described Vladimir Putin as a car with no reverse gear and no brakes, careering down the highway, accelerator pedal stuck to the floor.",
      "From what I can see, little has changed.",
      "Don\u2019t expect the Putinmobile to suddenly decelerate or de-escalate now in the face of longer-range missile strikes on Russia.",
      "Escalation, though, is another matter. That\u2019s a distinct possibility.",
      "Ukraine will be bracing itself for more Russian attacks, even heavier bombardments.",
      "Western governments will be assessing the threat level in light of Putin\u2019s warnings.",
      "Even before the Kremlin leader\u2019s TV address, there had been fears in the West of an upsurge in hybrid Russian warfare.",
      "Last month the head of MI5 warned that Russian military intelligence was engaged in a campaign to \u201cgenerate mayhem on British and European streets\".",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen arson, sabotage and more,\" he added.",
      "Back in June, Putin suggested that Moscow might arm adversaries of the West if Ukraine were allowed to strike deep into Russia with Western long-range missiles.",
      "\"We believe that if someone is thinking it is possible to supply such weapons to a war zone to strike our territory and create problems for us,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy can\u2019t we supply our weapons of the same class to those regions around the world where they will target sensitive facilities of the countries that are doing this to Russia?\"",
      "Putin warns West as Russia hits Ukraine with new missile",
      "The nuclear option",
      "The question \u201cWhat will Putin do next?\u201d is usually followed by: \u201cWould Putin use a nuclear weapon in the Ukraine war?\u201d",
      "The Russian president has dropped some unsubtle hints.",
      "On announcing the start of his \"special military operation\" \u2013 the full-scale invasion of Ukraine \u2013 he had issued a warning to \u201cthose who may be tempted to interfere from the outside\u201d.",
      "\u201cNo matter who tries to stand in our way or create threats for our country and our people,\u201d the Kremlin leader declared, \u201cthey must know that Russia will respond immediately.",
      "\u201cAnd the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history.\u201d",
      "Western leaders generally dismissed what they saw as nuclear sabre-rattling. Since the start of the war Western governments have crossed several Russian \"red lines\":  providing Ukraine with tanks, advanced missile systems and then F-16 fighter jets.",
      "The \"consequences\" threatened by the Kremlin never materialised.",
      "In September Putin announced he was lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons - the decree was published this week. A clear warning to Europe and America not to allow longer-range missile strikes on Russian territory.",
      "Now this red line, too, has been crossed. In his address to the nation Putin confirmed Western reports that Ukraine had fired US-supplied Atacms and British-made Storm Shadow missiles at targets inside Russia.",
      "Earlier this week, when pro-Kremlin tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets asked a retired lieutenant-general how Russia should respond to an Atacms attack on Bryansk region, he replied:",
      "\u201cStarting World War Three over strikes on an arms depot in Bryansk region would probably be short-sighted.\u201d",
      "It would be comforting to think that the Kremlin shares that view.",
      "But Vladimir Putin\u2019s address to the nation contained no evidence of that.",
      "His message to Ukraine\u2019s supporters in the West appeared to be: this is a red line I\u2019m serious about, I dare you to cross it.",
      "\u201cEven Putin doesn\u2019t know whether he can use a nuclear weapon, or he can\u2019t. It depends on his emotions,\u201d Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov told me recently.",
      "\u201cWe know he\u2019s a very emotional man. The decision to begin this war was also an emotional step. Because of that we must take seriously his idea of the changing of the nuclear doctrine. They say the fear of war must return and will contain both sides, but this is also a tool of escalation.",
      "\u201cIn this interpretation we must admit that Putin, under some circumstances, can use at least a tactical nuclear weapon in the framework of a limited nuclear war. It will not solve the problem. But it will be the start of a suicidal escalation for the whole world.\u201d",
      "Tactical nuclear weapons are small warheads intended for use on the battlefield or  a limited strike.",
      "The Trump factor",
      "Vladimir Putin may act on emotions. He is also, clearly, driven by resentment of the West and appears determined not to back down.",
      "But he also knows the world could soon be a very different place.",
      "In two months\u2019 time Joe Biden will be out of office and Donald Trump will be in the White House.",

      "He\u2019s also said recently that talking to Vladimir Putin would be \u201ca smart thing\u201d.",
      "All of that should be music to Putin\u2019s ears.",
      "Which means that, despite the latest threats and warnings, the Kremlin may decide against a major escalation right now.",

      "He was a bridgehead to Labour's traditional working class roots who saw the value in, and indeed personified, championing the aspirations of the less well off.",
      "His value to Tony Blair, who swept to a landslide victory in 1997 and went on to win two further elections with Prescott at his side, was that he could reassure and lead those within Labour sceptical of its movement towards the centre.",
      "He was also a binding agent, skilled at holding the party and its sometimes warring factions together.",
      "It is not hard to see the parallels between then and now, when we once again have a plain-speaking working class northerner as deputy prime minister to a polished North London lawyer.",
      "Angela Rayner's backstory - and approach to politics - have clear parallels with John Prescott, something Rayner herself has openly acknowledged.",
      "Describing how she planned to do the job of deputy PM in 2022, she told LBC:  \"I'm going to be John Prescott in a skirt, I just say it how I see it.\"",
      "She added: \"Me and John are good mates, we see each other quite frequently, and I definitely look better in a skirt.\"",

      "And both were able to articulate the authentic instincts of Labour's base of supporters, in a language, and style, they themselves would often use.",
      "Prescott sometimes had an unconventional way of wooing voters, which on one famous occasion stretched to punching one of them.",
      "And, in the 2020s, as the modern Labour Party sought to jump start its popularity, courting recent Conservative voters, it was Rayner who described some Tory ministers as \u201ca bunch of scum\u201d \u2013 remarks she later apologised for.",
      "The old jibe that all politicians look and sound the same could never apply to Prescott or Rayner.",
      "Social class is a key prism through which to reflect on Prescott\u2019s career, politics and life.",

      "John Leslie Prescott was born in Prestatyn, then in Flintshire, on 31 May 1938. His father was a railway signalman and his mother came from a mining family.",
      "Although his family left Wales when he was four, he remained proud of his heritage and always considered himself Welsh.",
      "He became a trainee chef on leaving school at 15 and then worked for eight years as a ship's steward on passenger liners, becoming active in the National Union of Seamen.",
      "In 1962, he went to Ruskin College, Oxford, where he got a diploma in economics and politics, and later to Hull University to study for an economics degree.",
      "Active in the merchant sailors' strike of 1966, he served as an official with the National Union of Seamen for two years before his election, in 1970, as MP for Hull East, sponsored by the union.",
      "Cherished principles",
      "John Prescott became a Labour frontbench spokesman in May 1979 and joined the shadow cabinet in 1983, gaining a reputation as a pugnacious and knowledgeable spokesman on transport.",
      "The same year his showman's instincts saw him swim two miles down the River Thames to highlight opposition to Margaret Thatcher's government policy of dumping nuclear waste at sea.",
      "But it was the Labour leader John Smith who finally gave John Prescott political room to breathe, with a key role in selling modernisation to the party and unions.",
      "It was John Smith who kick-started Labour's slow return to power, overturning many of the party's most cherished principles in a drive to make it electable again.",
      "And John Prescott, with his strong union links and no-nonsense approach, offered vital support, not least in the abolition of the union block vote that had been Labour policy for years.",
      "When Tony Blair became leader, following John Smith's untimely death in 1994, he too recognised the importance of keeping John Prescott on board.",
      "The Hull East MP became deputy leader and later deputy prime minister with wide departmental responsibility over transport and the environment.",
      "He pledged to create an integrated transport system and said his success would be measured by a reduction in people needing to use a car.",
      "This caused him considerable embarrassment when, at the 1999 Labour conference, he used his ministerial car - a Jaguar - for a 200-yard journey back to his hotel.",
      "In typical Prescott style, he claimed it was so his wife Pauline's hair would not get blown about.",
      "But the politician, who also owned a Jaguar himself, was soon dubbed \"two Jags\" in the press.",
      "He once described himself as the guard on the Labour train - ready to slow it down if it moved off the rails. Yet his solid working-class credentials added powerful support to Tony Blair and the Labour modernisers.",
      "He campaigned passionately against the Conservative policy of privatising Britain's railways and was reported to have been furious when Labour failed to adopt a policy of renationalisation when returned to power.",
      "Election punch",
      "His policy of creating elected regional assemblies to oversee the new regional development agencies also hit the buffers, when, in a referendum in a pilot area in England's North East, 78% of people rejected the idea.",
      "He also faced opposition over his so-called Pathfinder project, designed to provide thousands of new homes.",
      "As part of the policy, about 200,000 homes in the North of England were demolished, which, critics said, could have been renovated at much less cost.",
      "His passion and burly style of delivery were constant features.",
      "He repeatedly described New Labour's mission as delivering \"traditional values in a modern setting\" - a powerful if somewhat intangible concept.",
      "Mocked by some for mangling his syntax, he often still managed to inject humour into difficult situations - such as when he was criticised for accusing a female French minister of being too tired to understand the intricacies of an environment summit.",
      "\"As to whether I am accused of being a macho man - moi?\" he told the Commons. \"I must say the remark leaves me most gutted.\"",
      "He hit the headlines during the 2001 general election after he was filmed throwing a punch at a member of the public who had thrown an egg at him during a protest in Rhyl, Flintshire.",
      "John Prescott said he had acted in self-defence and police refused to take any further action. Subsequent newspaper polls suggested most people supported his reaction.",
      "Oyster bar",
      "In later days, John Prescott reportedly had to act as a peacemaker between Tony Blair and the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, as speculation about the succession to the leadership ebbed and flowed.",
      "His own comment in a newspaper, that the \"tectonic plates\" in the Labour Party were moving, gave rise to suggestions of manoeuvring within the cabinet.",
      "And when he was seen sharing a car with Gordon Brown and stopping off at a Scottish oyster bar, the rumours that Tony Blair was about to stand down intensified.",
      "However, as his career as an MP neared its end, the headlines surrounding John Prescott concentrated on his private life.",
      "In 2006, he admitted to an affair with his former secretary Tracey Temple, which led to a raft of lurid stories.",
      "In a cabinet reshuffle soon after the revelations emerged, John Prescott was stripped of his department, although kept on as deputy prime minister and allowed to retain his salary and grace-and-favour homes.",
      "But, in a further embarrassment, he felt compelled to give up his country pile, Dorneywood, after being pictured on its lawns playing croquet with his staff - an image at odds with his down-to-earth reputation.",
      "It was later revealed he had visited the US ranch of businessman Philip Anschutz - whose company took over the running of the Millennium Dome and who was bidding to build Britain's first super-casino.",
      "Critics said there was a conflict of interest. John Prescott, who met Mr Anschutz seven times, failed to declare the visit for 11 months. He eventually said he had gone because he liked cowboy films.",
      "The Commons Standards and Privileges Committee ruled the ministerial code had been broken because the trip had not been declared immediately.",
      "Lording it",
      "Shortly after Tony Blair said he would be stepping down as prime minister, John Prescott announced he would relinquish his role as deputy.",
      "He ended his time in government with no ministerial brief of his own and was seen by many as a peripheral figure.",
      "To the surprise of many of his supporters, he accepted a peerage in 2010 despite reportedly having once said: \"I don't want to be a member of the House of Lords. I will not accept it.\"",
      "He defended the decision because it would give him continued influence over environmental policy and he refused to treat the red benches as an upmarket retirement home, using them as a platform to carry on campaigning.",
      "He continued to serve in the Lords until July of this year, when he was removed for non-attendance - bringing down the curtain on a parliamentary career of more than 50 years.",
      "His most robust interventions in Lords debates involved attacking the government's response to the phone-hacking scandal.",
      "For Lord Prescott, the matter was personal - his lawyers alleged the News of the World had placed him under surveillance, and in 2012 he won a pay out from the paper's parent company, News International.",
      "He was back on the stump again in 2012 when he stood as a candidate in Humberside in the elections for the new office of police and crime commissioner.",
      "He was said to be disappointed when he lost out to a Conservative opponent on the second round of balloting.",
      "Party loyalist",
      "John Prescott remained a Labour loyalist at heart.",
      "While ultimately distancing himself from Tony Blair's decision to go to war in Iraq, he defended his former boss' legacy and was equally supportive of the different leaders that followed him.",
      "He also advised the then-Labour leader Ed Miliband in the run up to the 2015 election.",
      "He was far from a natural bedfellow of Jeremy Corbyn but insisted the left-wing campaigner - who opposed nearly all of what New Labour stood for - had \"proved himself\", and urged dissident MPs to support him.",
      "His son David - who himself stood unsuccessfully for Parliament - was even part of Jeremy Corbyn's team.",
      "And speaking at Labour's 2017 conference - the 51st he had attended - he said the party was on the path back to government and had a \"really exciting\" future.",
      "In 2019, he suffered a stroke and was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. But his former Labour colleague, Alan Johnson, said there were \"no signs of him slowing down at all\".",
      "To the very end, he represented a breed apart from many of his contemporaries - a Labour MP who had cut his campaigning teeth in a trades union rather than as a political adviser and who believed political principles had to be married to power.",

On 4 November, the prime minister announced plans to create a new Border Security Command, which the government say will have enhanced powers to trace suspected traffickers and shut down their bank accounts. One hundred additional specialist investigators will be assigned to the National Crime Agency (NCA), one of the UK bodies tasked with cracking down on people smugglers, while the Crown Prosecution Service will deliver charging decisions more quickly in international organised crime cases.",

      "Over the last week, as part of a series on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, we traced the path of migrants from Turkey to Bulgaria to the rest of Europe - the \u201cbiggest growth route\u201d for those travelling into Europe, according to the University of Oxford\u2019s Migration Observatory - in search of what it will really take to \u201csmash the gangs\u201d.",
      "When we talk about smuggling gangs, we tend to focus on the end of the process, such as the UK's relations with France, and on the movement of people across the English Channel, but our route marks the start of the journey: it\u2019s where migrants first enter Europe.",
      "Along the way,  we spoke to migrants who shared their complicated reasons for putting their lives in the hands of people smugglers. What soon became clear was the sheer magnitude of the government\u2019s task.",
      "Gateway to Europe: the Turkey challenge",
      "The crowded shopping bazaar in the Istanbul district of Esenyurt is popular with the thousands of Syrian refugees who live in the region. \u201cYou can see Syrian shops here,\u201d Husam, a Syrian refugee, told us as he showed us around after Friday prayers. \u201cMany were not here in 2015. You have falafel, shawarma - many shops for Syrian food. It was a comfortable, safe place for Syrians.\u201d But now the mood is darkening.",
      "\u201cIn the past few years it\u2019s not safe any more,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are groups of racist people who don\u2019t like refugees. On public transportation you cannot speak comfortably in Arabic on your phone. People are attacked [for] speaking Arabic.\u201d",
      "Turkey has more refugees than any other country. It opened its borders to people fleeing the war in Syria in 2011; now there are upwards of three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, according to the UN. But Turks are getting restless. President Recep Erdogan has urged refugees - who he calls \u201cguests\u201d - to go home.",
      "Migrants without papers are being arrested and deported. Even those who have papers face being harassed, and now many who made temporary homes in Turkey want to leave - legally if possible - but, where necessary, they use people smugglers.",
      "All of this is being watched by Westminster. With so many people so desperate to move westwards, one of the British Government\u2019s prime tasks, if it is to keep its promise to reduce illegal arrivals, is to start cracking Turkey\u2019s people-smuggling model. And that starts with social media.",
      "For years, smugglers have used Facebook and other platforms to advertise safe passage between countries, often including prices and package deals such as \u201ckids go free\u201d.",
      "Over a traditional Syrian meat-and-rice dish of maqluba, Ali, a former footballer from Damascus, gets out his phone and shows us social media videos that promote smuggling routes. They are slick and professional, with pictures of boats and people looking joyous as they arrive in Greece.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely I\u2019m thinking about leaving,\u201d Ali admits. \u201cNot just me, all my friends.\u201d",
      "Britain is one of the destinations he has in mind, along with the Netherlands and Germany.",
      "Stemming the flow from Turkey",
      "The exodus from Turkey is not surprising, says Marc Pierini, EU ambassador to Turkey between 2006 and 2011. \u201cSyrian refugees in Turkey have over the past few years become the scapegoat\u2026 A whole xenophobic narrative has been [created] by the authorities.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s poor economy is only adding to the problem, argues Murat Erdo\u011fan, a professor of migration studies at Ankara University, who is no relation to the president. Interest rates were raised to 40% last year amid soaring inflation.",
      "For years, successive European governments have attempted to crack down on the smuggling ring here by giving money and logistical support to Turkish police and coastguard. A 2016 deal between the EU and Turkey - in which Turkey was given aid in return for its help reducing the flow of migrants travelling to Greece on boats - was an early attempt to undermine the smuggling business model.",
      "But Rob Jones, director of operations at the NCA, says cracking down on the trade is complex - and even more difficult than policing the movement of illegal drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s harder, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s more organic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt relies on a series of informal trusted relationships\u201d.",
      "Smuggling gangs often use hawala - a payment method that avoids formal banking and instead relies on a network of agents to deliver cash across borders. \u201cThat means we don\u2019t have large amounts of cash moving between borders or even electronically, like we do with the drug trade,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also difficult because it utilises ubiquitous social media apps which allow people to be handed between groups at ease. \u201c",
      "In Britain, ministers of successive governments have recognised this as part of the problem, as well as the need to tackle social media advertising. Since 2021, the NCA has worked with Meta, X, TikTok and YouTube to remove posts promoting smuggling services. By this summer, 12,000 posts had been deleted, the agency said.",
      "The newly appointed Border Security Commander, Martin Hewitt, has told us: \u201cWe will keep chipping away and undermining their business to the point where that is no longer viable and profitable.\u201d",
      "But our experience in Turkey showed us that - to date - it\u2019s still possible to connect with a smuggler at the click of a button.",
      "Crackdown at the border",
      "The NCA has highlighted a particular area that is a \u201ccrucible\u201d for organised immigration crime: the crossing between Turkey and Bulgaria, which marks the EU\u2019s external frontier.",
      "We visited the tiny Bulgarian mountain village of Shtit, a sleepy place with dirt roads and rusting farm machinery - a place that doesn\u2019t seem to hold much geopolitical significance, but that\u2019s right at the border, which is marked by a 4m high fence and razor wire.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sharp and it\u2019s almost impossible to climb with bare hands,\u201d says Hamid, the Iranian refugee who crossed it in 2019. \u201cUsually they\u2019re using ladders, but there\u2019s some places [along the fence] that they\u2019ve already cut.\u201d",
      "Our conversation is interrupted by a passing patrol car. Two uniformed officers warn us not to take photographs of the border; presumably, if shared on social media they can help migrants make the crossing.",
      "Nikolai, a chef in a local restaurant, tells us he has seen a marked increase in security in the area - many of the guards are from Germany and Poland, and are working in Bulgaria as part of the EU\u2019s border force, Frontex.",
      "Certainly, the Bulgarians have made strides in policing their side of the border. In recent years they have installed cameras, drones, and ramped up the number of security staff.",
      "This ring-of-steel-style system has had some success: the number of migrants crossing here has fallen in the last two years, says Atanas Rusev, director of the Security Programme at the Centre for Study of Democracy. But there are gaps.",
      "The porousness of the border is apparent about 32km down the road, at the Kapitan Andreevo crossing, uniting Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey - the busiest such border in Europe. The terrain is mountainous, with parts covered by thick forests making it easy for migrants to go undetected.",
      "\u201cIn order to police you need thousands of people on the ground,\u201d Mr Rusev explains. \u201cYou cannot put a man every five metres - so you have these patrols that are moving across certain sections of the border. Then you have the fence, but the fence is not a big obstacle because you need a simple wooden ladder.\u201d",
      "The smuggling gangs are clever and \u201cknow the terrain very well\u201d, he explains. \u201cIf you think that you can stop these irregular flows just with policing and prosecution and securitising, it\u2019s a road to nowhere.\u201d",
      "Fines for carrying inflatable boats",
      "And they\u2019re not just trying to stop people. Many of the rubber inflatable boats used to smuggle migrants across the Channel are manufactured in Turkey and transported over this very border.",
      "One difficulty stopping the boats is that it is legal to carry inflatables across Europe; they might be used for a fishing trip.  But following talks with the UK, the Bulgarians have changed their customs regulations to say that only certain Turkish companies are licensed to export boats.",
      "Anyone found with an unlicensed vessel in the back of their car can face a \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,666) euro fine. To help detect those boats is a dog, Adele, trained by the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency to sniff out rubber. Her harness carries both Bulgarian and UK flags.",
      "I point out to Valerie, the border agent showing us around, that smuggling gangs can make thousands of pounds of profit off each passenger. Perhaps the gangs are happy to risk a \u20ac2,000 fine?",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d comes the answer, \u201cbut we stop some.\u201d",
      "So where does this leave Britain?",
      "Back in Britain, the prime minister has suggested that policing, intelligence and more international cooperation is the answer. Our experience in Bulgaria of the attempt to disrupt the trade in boats being exported from Turkey highlights the benefits of this approach and also its limitations. Even with drones, cameras and security staff, thousands of people stream into the country illegally every year. It's certainly not a promising sign.",
      "And yet the government\u2019s heavy focus on policing and security has paid off in some ways. Earlier this month, Amanj Hasan Zada, who organised cross-Channel smuggling from his home in Lancashire and was feted as \u201cthe best smuggler\u201d, was convicted and given a 17-year sentence.",
      "Why so many prime ministers have failed to cut migration",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "Peter Walsh, head of the Migration Observatory, is more optimistic than some about Labour\u2019s beefed-up security approach, pointing out that it\u2019s possible to reduce the flow of people. But he stresses that the success or failure ultimately depends on global trends in people smuggling, over which UK ministers have little control.",
      "He also fears police might end up in a game of whack-a-mole. \u201cThe people most directly involved in smuggling activity can [be] apprehended - but they can quickly be replaced.\u201d",
      "Which poses a new question. As he puts it: can you apprehend people more quickly than they can be replaced?",
      "Alternative routes",
      "There are alternative strategies to police-first - but each is loaded with its own problems. For example, by giving money to countries such as Syria, it\u2019s possible to tackle what are termed the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration so there\u2019s less need for refugees to flee. The prime minister made a gesture to this strategy in the summer, pledging \u00a384m for education and employment opportunities in Africa and Middle East. But even the most optimistic of humanitarians don\u2019t think this is a solution in the short- or even medium-term, or that \u00a384m is enough to fix the problems.",
      "Then there\u2019s the prospect of bilateral deals. The \u201cgold standard\u201d for the UK would be to strike a generous beach-returns deal with France, says Mr Walsh, in which France agrees to take back migrants who arrive via the Channel and intercept boats. \u201cBut what\u2019s in it for France?\u201d Mr Walsh asks.",
      "Finally there\u2019s the option of offering \u201csafe and legal\u201d routes for refugees to enter Britain, the policy preferred by some charities. But other experts suggest this would amount only to a few thousand people per year - and attempt to seriously ramp up numbers may become politically toxic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be more people that want to arrive than can arrive,\u201c added Mr Walsh. And those people will make it through any means necessary.",
      "Of everything we saw in Turkey and Bulgaria, one memory stays with me that proves this very point. It was at the Harmanli refugee camp, the largest in Bulgaria. There, we met a group of 10 Syrian men who had recently made the crossing from Turkey. Their smugglers knew exactly where they could climb over the fence, they told us.",
      "But what about the hi-tech cameras, the drones, and the extra police, I asked? They just shrugged. It didn\u2019t seem like they\u2019d struggled.",
      "It impressed upon me the enormity of Labour\u2019s task. After all, ministers can throw whatever resources they want at the issue of gangs but if migrants are determined enough, and if the money for gangsters is tempting enough, some will always find a way through.",
      "Mr Walsh is also sceptical of whether people smuggling gangs can be cracked at scale, drawing the comparison of drugs gangs. \u201dThere\u2019s a fair amount of investment that goes into controlling the sale of illicit drugs, yet they continue,\u201d he argues. \u201cSo the idea that you can stamp it out entirely is just not feasible.",
      "\u201cYes you can make a difference, but it\u2019s impossible to reduce it to zero.\u201d",
      "No-one who works with migrants, no-one who works on border security, would ever say the sort of words or phrases routinely in political slogans: \u201cstop the boats\u201d or \u201csmash the gangs\u201d. What they talk about instead is a much more modest ambition of making it harder to cross borders without the right paperwork, reducing the number who do so and disrupting the people smugglers. But they all accept that those who really want to make it from one side of the border to the other will probably eventually succeed.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:27:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Why has the inheritance tax for farmers argument got so noisy, so quickly?",
    "story": [
      "The farmers' demonstration was best summed up in two images: real tractors being driven by farmers around Parliament Square, and beside them a collection of toy tractors being pedalled around by their children.",
      "They illustrated the essence of the farmers\u2019 argument: there is a deep-seated cultural expectation that they will pass on their farm to the next generation.",
      "For many, it feels like a deep responsibility that stretches high into their family tree, and so the expectation falls upon them to ensure the very thing their forebears did for them they manage to as well \u2013 hand it down to their sons and daughters.",
      "As a reporter, I love covering protests and marches at Westminster.",
      "They are an essential megaphone in the never-ending conversation of our democracy.",
      "I have been turning up at them with a microphone and camera for 20 years \u2013 to witness and scrutinise those making the most of their much-cherished right to come to London and \u2013 often \u2013 shout at the government.",
      "I love them because people sufficiently passionate about their cause to trek to the capital and then make a public, almost certainly contentious, argument often deserve to be listened to and should be vigorously questioned too.",
      "And, for me, those conversations offer an insight into not just what those protesting think, but why they think it.",
      "This gathering of farmers left me with three thoughts:",
      "Firstly, as we have already explored, there is the huge power of the cultural expectation of handing on a farm to the next generation.",
      "It is not just a business, but an identity, a belonging, a geographical rootedness \u2013 and the prospect of not being able to pass it on generates huge anger and emotion.",
      "That is a big part of the explanation for why this argument has got so noisy, so quickly.",
      "Secondly, contested notions of fairness are so often central to the most contentious political arguments, and this one is no different.",
      "The government argues existing inheritance tax isn\u2019t fair or sustainable \u2013 as everyone else sufficiently well off to pay it is charged 40% and farmers are charged nothing.",
      "Ministers also argue the exemptions have tempted rich folk to buy up farm land \u2013 pushing up its value \u2013 primarily to avoid inheritance tax.",
      "And, as they are at pains to point out over and over again, they insist the vast majority of family farms will be unaffected and those that are will be charged 20%, half the rate charged to anyone else caught within its grasp.",
      "Plus, they say, schools and hospitals desperately need more money.",
      "Others say the farmers are a noisy, well-organised lobby group seeking to shield their often considerable wealth and perpetuate a privilege to the exclusion of others.",
      "And all this brings us to the third big question here: what does it mean to be rich?",
      "Talking to farmers, very quickly our conversation would often involve very big numbers - talk of assets running into a few million pounds.",
      "These are huge figures that point to considerable wealth and yet the farmers insist, for two reasons, they are not rich.",
      "Their annual income is often modest, they point out - and they don\u2019t value their farm in numerical terms, but in emotional ones. The prospect of selling it horrifies them; handing it on is what they seek to do.",
      "The farmers insist they are determined to press on with their campaign.",
      "Ministers insist they are determined to press on with their plans for change.",
      "You may choose to sympathise with the farmers\u2019 arguments or not \u2013 or the government\u2019s arguments, or not \u2013 but the protests offer an insight into what contributes to the view of many of the farmers, and why them backing down doesn\u2019t seem likely any time soon.",

    "summary": "Fraught debate revealed the divide between rich and poor as the UN conference sealed a climate finance deal.",
    "story": [
      "COP29 is over, with developing countries complaining that the $300bn (about \u00a3240bn) a year in climate finance they will receive by 2035 is a \"paltry sum\".",
      "Many of the rich country voices at the UN's climate conference were amazed that developing nations were unhappy with what on the surface seems a huge settlement. It is an improvement - on the current contribution of $100bn (\u00a379.8bn) a year.",
      "However, the developing world, which had pushed for more, had many genuine issues with the final sum.",
      "A massive deal, but bitter divisions remain",
      "There were complaints it simply was not enough and that it was a mixture of grants and loans. And countries were deeply annoyed by the way the wealthy waited until the last minute to reveal their hand.",
      "\u201cIt's a paltry sum,\" India's delegate Chandni Raina told other delegates, after the deal had been gavelled through.",
      "\"This document is little more than an optical illusion. This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face.\"",
      "Ultimately, the developing world was compelled to accept it, with many rich countries pointing to next year's arrival of President Donald Trump, a known climate sceptic, and arguing that they would not get a better deal.",
      "But this package is also being criticised as short-sighted from the richer world\u2019s perspective.",
      "The argument runs that if you want to keep the world safe from rising temperatures, then wealthier nations need to help emerging economies cut their emissions, because that is where 75% of the growth in emissions has occurred in the past decade.",
      "New national plans are due to be published next spring to outline how every country will limit their planet warming gases over the next 10 years.",
      "A more generous cash settlement at COP29 would undoubtedly have had a positive knock-on effect on those efforts.",
      "And at a time of geopolitical uncertainty and distraction, keeping countries united on climate should be critical. The big fight over money re-opened old divisions between rich and poor, with an anger and bitterness I have not seen in years.",
      "COP itself is on the ropes",
      "Shepherding 200 countries to an intricate deal on climate finance was always going to be a tough task. But for hosts Azerbaijan, a country with no real history of involvement in the COP process, it proved to be almost beyond them.",
      "The country\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, did not help matters by describing oil and gas as a \"gift from God\". His blunt attacks - accusing \"Western fake news media\", charities and politicians of \"spreading disinformation\" - did not improve matters.",
      "Azerbaijan follows Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as the third authoritarian state in a row to host COP, raising concerns about how host countries are selected.",
      "Azerbaijan, like the UAE, has an economy which is built on oil and gas exports, which seems at odds with a process that is meant to be helping the world transition away from coal, oil and gas.",
      "Privately, many senior negotiators spoke of their frustration with what some termed the worst COP in a decade. Half-way through the meeting, several senior climate leaders wrote a public letter saying COP was not fit for purpose and calling for reform.",
      "The quiet ascent of China",
      "With the role of the US in future climate talks in doubt because of Trump, attention shifted to who might become the real climate leader in the expected absence of the US over the next four years.",
      "The natural successor is China.",
      "The world\u2019s largest carbon emitter was largely silent at this year's COP, only showing its hand to give details for the first time on the amount of climate finance it gives to developing countries.",
      "China is still defined by the United Nations as a \"developing\" country, meaning it has no formal obligation to cut greenhouse gas emissions or provide financial help to poorer countries.",
      "However, China has agreed to a formula in the finance deal that would allow its contributions to be counted in the overall fund for climate-vulnerable countries, on a voluntary basis.",
      "All in all, a move that is being seen as very deft and effective.",
      "\u201cChina is becoming more transparent about its financial support to global south countries,\u201d said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThis should propel the country to play a larger role in the future.\"",
      "'Trump-proofing' the climate",
      "Although he was not there, Trump\u2019s presence was felt across COP.",
      "One common element among the negotiators in Baku was the need to ensure that a second Trump administration would not upend years of careful climate negotiations.",
      "So it was no surprise to see that richer nations wanted to commit to raising funding by 2035. They believe putting that date will allow the US to contribute again once Trump has left office.",
      "Similarly, the drive to increase the contributor base was done with Trump in mind.",
      "Bringing China to the table, even in a voluntary capacity, will be used to show that it is worth engaging in international forums like COP.",
      "\"No-one thinks Trump in the White House will be anything but damaging to the multilateral climate regime,\" said Prof Michael Jacobs, visiting senior fellow at the think tank ODI Global.",
      "\"But this agreement was about trying to limit the damage as much as possible.\u201d",
      "Campaigners become more vocal",
      "One very noticeable trend at COP29 was the sometimes more aggressive stance taken by many environmental NGOs and campaigners.",
      "I witnessed it myself when US climate envoy John Podesta was chased out a meeting area with chants of \u201cshame\u201d ringing in his ears.",
      "Many developing countries rely on these NGOs for support in dealing with complex events like COP.",
      "During the talks, there was a strong push from many of these campaigners for an outright rejection of almost any deal.",

      "The WhatsApp message was from the chief negotiator of one of the most powerful countries at the COP climate gathering. Could I stop by for a chat, he asked.",
      "As his team hunched over computers eating takeaway pizza, he raged about the obstructionist behaviour of many of the other teams at the conference.",

      "Looming over it all was the prospect of US president-elect Donald Trump withdrawing the US from the COP process when he takes office for a second time. He has called climate action a \u201cscam\u201d and, at his victory celebration in West Palm Beach earlier this month, vowed to boost US oil production beyond its current record levels, saying, \u201cWe have more liquid gold than any country in the world\u201d.",
      "But there was one positive: China.",
      "\u201cIt's the only bright spot in all of this is,\u201d the chief negotiator told me. Not only was its negotiating style markedly different to previous years, but he also observed that, as he puts it, \u201cChina could be stepping forward.\u201d",
      "Another sign that this may be the case came at the start of the conference, when China made public details of its climate funding. Traditionally, China has released minimal information about its climate policies and plans, so it came as a surprise when, for the first time, officials said they have paid developing countries more than $24 billion for climate action since 2016.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s serious money, almost nobody else is at that level,\u201d one COP insider told me.",
      "It is a \u201cnotable signal\u201d, says Li Shuo, a director of China Climate Hub, \u201cas it\u2019s the first time that the Chinese government has laid out a clear figure in terms of how much they have been providing.\u201d",
      "If these are indeed signs that China plans to take a more central role in the future, just as the US is stepping back, it would mark a tectonic shift in the COP process.",
      "How that tectonic shift could look",
      "Historically, Western countries \u2013 particularly the US and EU \u2013 have provided the momentum, cheered on by smaller climate-vulnerable nations. The difference in the way the talks play out if China steps forward will be marked.",
      "Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, has been to every COP and understands better than most the behind-the-scenes bartering, bullying and brinkmanship that makes or breaks deals at summits. He says that China won\u2019t lead from the front, like the US and Europe.",
      "\u201cThey're more cautious players than that. It may be that they're leading with Chinese characteristics, which is what they might say themselves.\u201d",
      "Starmer will struggle to keep his \u2018smash the gangs\u2019 promise - as I saw firsthand",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "(This echoes how Deng Xiaoping, president in the early 1980s, described his economic reforms, which catapulted the country\u2019s economic growth into double figures: \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d.)",
      "Pershing suggests that China is likely to help drive the COP process forward by discreetly intervening to unblock disputes. Most of this effort will take place behind closed doors, he believes, but is likely to include urging developing and developed countries to increase their ambition \u2013 and the flow of cash.",
      "However China may not be entirely helpful on some of the challenges that slow the process, such as instances when countries use COP as a stage to champion their own interests.",
      "One of the biggest blockers in Baku was said to be Saudi Arabia, which heads up a group of fossil fuel producing countries that want to slow the transition to renewables. As a big consumer of fossil fuels, China has often thrown its weight behind them in the past, such as by resisting the UK\u2019s effort to get agreement to phase out coal at COP26 in Glasgow.",
      "A new \"unusually cooperative\" style",
      "There have been some other occasions in this year's talks that indicate how China's approach is already shifting.",
      "In the past, it tended to focus on its own interests and as such, it played a dual role in these talks. Sometimes it has aligned with the US and Europe, for example on ambitious targets to boost renewable power or on the reduction of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. On other issues, meanwhile, it has slowed progress.",
      "One such example was COP15, held in Copenhagen in 2009. There had been high hopes that an agreement would be reached to commit countries to deep cuts in carbon emissions. But the conference nearly collapsed when China fought against US pressure to submit to a regime of international monitoring. The final non-binding deal was generally considered a failure.",
      "This year was different, the chief negotiator I spoke to said. He observed that China was being \u201cunusually cooperative\u201d across all the discussions.",
      "Other changes were observed too, some around China's presentation of its own economic status.",
      "It is classed as a developing country in the context of UN climate talks, despite being the world\u2019s second biggest economy, the result of a peculiarity in the COP rules. (This is linked to its economic status in 1992 when the talks process began.) It has also long resisted pressure from developed countries to change its status, meaning it doesn\u2019t have to contribute to the pot that rich countries have agreed to pay to poorer ones. Yet this year some experts noticed a change in the wording used by Chinese negotiators.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is the language the Chinese used,\u201d says Professor Michael Jacobs, an expert on climate politics at Sheffield University.  \u201cThey described it as \u2018provided and mobilised\u2019 - that\u2019s the term developed countries use for their payments.\u201d",
      "Language matters at climate conferences. Negotiators can spend days discussing whether something \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d happen. So, the Chinese echoing the language of the rich world is significant, Prof Jacobs argues.",
      "\u201cThey used to calibrate everything against what the US did,\u201d he says. When Trump took office in 2016, China stood back from the talks in response. This time is different, according to Prof Jacobs.",
      "\u201cThis looks to me like a claim of leadership.\"",
      "What\u2019s in it for the East?",
      "None of this is driven by \"altruism\" on China\u2019s part,\u201d Prof Jacobs continues.",
      "According to Li Shuo, the shifting economics of renewables explains why China is likely to be a bigger player.",
      "\u201cThe green transformation is very much being led by China - not necessarily the government, but its private sector and companies\u201d. These companies lead the rest of the world by what Li Shuo says is a \u201cvery significant margin\u201d.",
      "Eight out of every ten solar panels are made in China, and it controls some two-thirds of wind turbine production. It is reckoned to produce at least three-quarters of the world\u2019s lithium batteries and more than 60% of the global market for electric vehicles.",
      "Earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that solar panels, EVs and batteries are the \u201cnew trio\u201d at the heart of the Chinese economy.",
      "It is the huge investments China has made in renewable technologies and the massive economies of scale that it has created that have also driven down renewable costs year after year - the challenge it faces now is finding new markets to sell it into.",
      "The developing world is where the demand is set to boom. These countries will account for two-thirds of the renewable market within 10 years, according to a recent report by a group of economists tasked by the UN with calculating the costs of the energy transition.",
      "Pakistan imported 13 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels in the first six months of this year alone, according to research by Bloomberg NEF. To put that in context, the UK has 17GW of installed solar.",
      "Shipping clean tech to emerging economies dovetails with another of China\u2019s policies: its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d an effort to develop new trade routes, including roads, railways, ports and airports, to connect with the rest of the world.",
      "China has spent more than a trillion dollars on the project, according to the World Economic Forum. Last week, President Xi opened a new port on the coast of Peru.",
      "Which begins to explain why, as Prof Jacobs sees it, while the US may withdraw, China looks like it might be stepping up. \u201cIt now sees its best interest as encouraging other countries to also cut their emissions by using Chinese technologies and equipment.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, though, regardless of whether this plays, out, there is cause for hope, according to some well-placed observers. Camilla Born, who has been part of the UK\u2019s negotiating team and helped run COP26 in Glasgow, believes that the future talks will be determined by the new economics of energy, not the politics of meetings.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about an idea of how to deal with climate change anymore,\u201d she argues. \u201cThis is about investments, about money - it\u2019s people\u2019s jobs, it\u2019s new technologies. The conversations are different.\u201d",
      "It is, after all, the biggest revolution in energy since the start of the industrial revolution. And regardless of which superpower takes the lead, or if the US is out of the game for four years, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone will want to miss out on such a vast market.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 01:22:23 GMT",
    "summary": "These caves were unexplored for thousands of years, protected by swirling mists and terrifying tales.",
    "story": [
      "The couple stands on the edge of the sheer limestone cliff.",
      "More than 100 metres (328ft) beneath them is a lost world of ancient forests, plants and animals. All they can see is leafy tree tops and hear is the echoes of cicadas and birds bouncing off the cliffs.",
      "For thousands of years, this \u201cheavenly pit\u201d or \u201ctiankeng\u201d, in Mandarin, was unexplored.",
      "People feared demons and ghosts hiding in the mists which swirled up from the depths.",
      "But drones and a few brave souls who lowered themselves into places untouched since dinosaurs roamed the Earth have revealed new treasures - and turned China\u2019s sinkholes into a tourist attraction.",
      "Two-thirds of the world\u2019s more than 300 sinkholes are in China, scattered throughout the country\u2019s west - with 30 known tiankeng, Guangxi province in the south has more of of them than anywhere else. Its biggest and most recent find was two years ago: an ancient forest with trees reaching as high as 40m (130ft). These cavities in the earth trap time, preserving unique, delicate ecosystems for centuries. Their discovery, however, has begun to draw tourists and developers, raising fears that these incredible, rare finds could be lost forever.",
      "Off the cliff",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never done this kind of thing before,\u201d says 25-year-old Rui, looking down into the chasm. \u201cIt\u2019s very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.\u201d",
      "She takes a big breath. Then she and her boyfriend step back - off the edge and into the air.",
      "Fei Ge - the man who had just meticulously checked Rui and Michael\u2019s harnesses before sending them over the cliff - knows better than most the feeling of stepping back over the edge.",
      "He was one of the first explorers. Now in his 50s, he works as a tour guide helping people discover the secrets of Guangxi's sinkholes.",
      "Growing up in a village nearby, Fe had been told to stay away. \u201cWe thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog.\u201d",
      "Fei Ge - or Brother Fei as he is known - was taught that these sinkholes have their own microclimate. The wind rushes through the tunnels and evaporated water from rivers inside the caves produces the mist.",
      "Eventually Brother Fei's curiosity won and he found a way into a sinkhole as a child.",
      "\u201cEvery tiny stone caused loud noises and echoes,\u201d he said. There was wind, rain and even \u201cmini tornadoes\u201d, he recalled. \u201cAt first, we were afraid.\u201d",
      "But he kept exploring. It was only when he brought scientists to the site that he realised how unique the sinkholes were.",
      "\u201cThe experts were astonished. They found new plants and told us they\u2019ve been doing research for decades and never seen these species. They were very excited. We couldn\u2019t believe that something we had taken for granted nearby was such a treasure.\u201d",
      "As scientists published their finds in journals, and word spread of their discovery, others came to study the sinkholes. Fei says explorers from the UK, France and Germany have come in the last 10 years.",
      "Sinkholes are rare. China - and Guangxi particularly - has so many because of the abundance of limestone. When an underground river slowly dissolves the surrounding limestone rock, it creates a cave that expands upwards towards the ground.",
      "Eventually, the ground collapses, leaving a yawning hole. Its depth and width must measure at least 100m for it to qualify as a sinkhole. Some, like the one found in Guangxi in 2022, are much bigger, stretching 300m into the earth and 150m wide.",
      "For scientists these cavernous pits are a journey back in time, to a place where they can study animals and plants they had thought extinct. They have also found species they had never seen or known, including types of wild orchid, ghostly white cave fish and various spiders and snails.",
      "Protected by sheer cliffs, jagged mountains and limestone caves, these plants and animals have thrived deep in the earth.",
      "Into the cave",
      "There is a delighted shriek as Rui dangles mid-air, before she starts rappelling down.",
      "This is just the start of the adventure for her and Michael. They have more ropework to do, in the belly of the cave.",
      "After a short walk through a maze of stalactites, Michael is lowered into the dark. The guides sweep the area with torches, illuminating the arc above us - a network of caves - and then shine the light into the narrow passages below, where a river once carved through the rock.",
      "That\u2019s where we are headed. The guides have to work hard to move the ropes into position.",
      "\u201cI am not a person that does much exercise,\u201d says Michael, his words echoing in the cave.",
      "This is the highlight of the Shanghai couple\u2019s two-week break in Guangxi, the kind of holiday they had craved during China\u2019s long Covid lockdowns. \u201cThis kind of tourism is more and more familiar on the Chinese internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw it and thought it looked pretty cool. That\u2019s why we wanted to try it.\u201d",
      "Videos of the Guangxi sinkholes have gone viral on social media. What is a fun and daring feat for young people is a source of much-needed revenue in a province that was only recently lifted out of poverty.",
      "There is little farmland in Guangxi\u2019s unusual but stunning terrain, and its mountainous borders make trade with the rest of China and neighbouring Vietnam difficult.",
      "Still, people come for the views. Pristine rivers and the soaring karst peaks of Guilin and Yangshuo in the north draw more than a million Chinese tourists each year. Photographs of mist-covered Guangxi have even made it onto the 20-yuan note.",
      "Yet few have heard of Ping'e village, the nearest settlement to the sinkholes. But that is changing.",
      "Brother Fei says says a steady stream of visitors is changing fortunes for some in Ping\u2019e. \u201cIt used to be very poor. We started developing tourism and it brought lots of benefits. Like when the highways were built. We were really happy knowing we have something so valuable here.\u201d",
      "But there are concerns that tourism revenue could override the demands of scientific research.",
      "About 50km from Ping\u2019e, developers have built what they say is the highest viewing platform, which overlooks Dashiwei, the second-deepest sinkhole in the world. Tourists can peer 500m down into this particular \u201cheavenly pit\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe should better protect such habitats,\u201d says Dr Lina Shen, a leading sinkhole researcher based in China. \u201cSinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species. We are continuing to make new discoveries.\u201d",
      "By studying sinkholes, scientists also hope to find out how the Earth has changed over tens of thousands of years, and better understand the impact of climate change. At least one sinkhole in Guangxi has already been closed to tourists to protect unique orchid varieties.",
      "\u201cOverdevelopment could cause tremendous damage. We should maintain their original ecological state,\u201d Dr Shen says, adding that the solution lies in striking a balance.",
      "\u201cHot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance could allow tourists to closely yet remotely view sinkholes, while disturbing as few organisms as possible.\u201d",
      "Brother Fei doesn\u2019t disagree, and insists there are \u201cclear rules\u201d to protect the sinkholes and what they hold. To him, they are a prized find that has changed his life. He is now one of Guangxi\u2019s most qualified climbers and a renowned guide for both tourists and scientists, which has made him \u201cvery happy\u201d.",
      "As we walk through acres of lush forest inside the sinkhole, he points to a cliff above us. He tells us to return when the rains do to see the waterfalls that pour down the side. It\u2019s worth coming back for, he assures us.",
      "Rui and Michael are being roped up as they encourage each other to abseil further into the cave. All that is visible beneath them is a narrow chasm, lit up by a torch. It\u2019s all that remains of a river bed, the catalyst in making this sinkhole.",
      "\u201cWe need to balance this joy with protecting this place,\u201d Michael says, looking around him.",
      "He smiles as he is slowly lowered down and disappears into the cave."

    "title": "Is nuclear power gaining new energy?",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

    "title": "Living in Delhi smog is like watching a dystopian film again and again",
    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 02:34:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Toxic, deadly, poisonous - these words are back in the headlines as Delhi\u2019s pollution spikes again.",
    "story": [
      "Winter has come to Delhi and with it, a familiar sense of gloom. The sky here is grey and there is a thick, visible blanket of smog.",
      "If you stay outdoors for more than a few minutes, you can almost taste ash. You will feel breathless within minutes if you try to run or even walk at a brisk pace in the smog.",
      "Newspapers are back to using words like \"toxic\", \"deadly\" and \"poisonous\" in their main headlines.",
      "Most schools have been shut and people have been advised to stay indoors - though those whose livelihoods depend on working outdoors can\u2019t afford to do so.",
      "Delhi\u2019s air quality score was somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 on Monday and Tuesday, according to different monitoring agencies. The acceptable limit is under than 100.",
      "These scores measure the levels of particulate matter - called PM 2.5 and PM10 - in the air. These tiny particles can enter the lungs and cause a host of diseases.",
      "On social media, people have been expressing shock, disappointment and anguish that it\u2019s all happening again.",
      "Along with the gloom, there is a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - like we have seen this all many times before in the past 15 years.",
      "I recorded this video of my drive to the office in 2017, when smog had reduced visibility to less than 2m.",
      "On Tuesday, my drive to the office seemed even worse.",
      "And we have covered every twist and turn of this story in the past two decades.",
      "We have reported how pollution is making people sick and reducing their life expectancy reducing their life expectancy.",
      "We have reported on India's Supreme Court ordering the government to take urgent steps to curb pollution every year. The court has done the same this year.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects children the most.",
      "We have written about how politicians blame each other for the problem every year.",
      "We have discussed the root cause of the problem.",
      "We have also talked about solutions - both the ones that marginally worked and the ones that failed miserably.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects the poorest the most and how many don\u2019t have a choice but to go out and work in the smog.",
      "Covering this story feels like watching (and being in) the same dystopian film every year - following the same characters, plot and script. The outcome is always the same - nothing changes.",
      "The parks are empty again - people, particularly children and the elderly, have been told to stay indoors.",
      "Those who must work - daily-wage labourers, rickshaw pullers, delivery riders - are coughing but still going out.",
      "Hospitals are seeing an increasing number of people coming in with respiratory problems.",
      "And amid all this, we are back to the same question again - why does nothing change?",
      "The simple answer is that solving Delhi's air problem requires monumental efforts and co-ordination.",
      "The sources of the problem are many. One of them is the practice of farmers burning crop remains to clear their fields quickly to sow seeds for the next yield.",
      "This mostly happens in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The smoke from the farm fires engulfs Delhi every winter and hangs low in the atmosphere as wind speeds reduce during winter months.",
      "But farmers can\u2019t be entirely blamed for this because this is the cheapest way of clearing fields.",
      "Different governments have talked about providing machines and financial incentives to stop crop burning, but very little has happened on the ground.",
      "Delhi itself produces a huge chunk of the pollution - emission from vehicles, construction and factories.",

    "summary": "The tech is being used to automatically control the creatures' access to feeders at sites across the UK.",
    "story": [
      "An artificial intelligence (AI) tool which has been trained to tell the difference between grey and red squirrels could be \"an absolute game changer\", conservationists say.",
      "The system, called Squirrel Agent, has been trained on thousands of images of the animals allowing it to tell them apart with 97% accuracy, its developer says.",
      "It can then be used to automatically control access to squirrel feeders - with only reds being allowed into those containing food, and only greys into those where food has been replaced with contraceptive paste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a real showcase of what AI can do,\u201d said Emma McClenaghan, co-founder of Genysys Engine, which developed the tool.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working in real time to do a task that we don\u2019t have enough [human] volunteers to do.\u201d",
      "Squirrel Agent is currently being tested in sites around the UK in conjunction with five wildlife charities.",
      "Genysys Engine hopes it will eventually be used much more widely not just with squirrels but with other species which would benefit from sophisticated digital monitoring.",
      "Ian Glendinning, from Northern Red Squirrels - one of the conservation groups involved in the trial - told the BBC that, for the animals he is trying to protect, help from technology was urgently needed.",
      "\u201cWe are in the bar of the last chance saloon, and the landlord has just called last orders,\" he said.",
      "Red peril",
      "Grey squirrels are largely responsible for the huge decline in the numbers of red squirrels.",
      "This is partly because there are so many of them, and also because they can carry a  virus which they have immunity to but is lethal to red squirrels. They arrived in the UK around 200 years ago.",
      "\u201cRed squirrels are hanging on in Scotland and Ireland, and there are some island populations like Anglesey and the Isle of Wight\", explained Mr Glendinning.",
      "\"But mainland England and Wales is in dire straits, and they will become extinct if we are unable to reverse this trend.\"",
      "Efforts to preserve red squirrels are further complicated by the fact that, despite their name, not all red squirrels are red.",
      "There are other markers including their tails, ears, size and weight which can also distinguish them from grey squirrels \u2013 the vastly dominant population - even if they are the same colour.",
      "The detection process is time-consuming for human observers - but Squirrel Agent uses the power of AI to rapidly analyse all those markers and decide with an extremely high level of accuracy which is which.",
      "It can then automatically decide whether to boost their survival chances by allowing them extra food - or reduce their likelihood of reproducing by steering them towards contraceptives.",
      "By a whisker",
      "Genysys Engine says the next step in the evolution of the tech is to go beyond just distinguishing between the types of squirrel and instead identify individual animals.",
      "This will be done, Emma McClenaghan says, by focusing on their whiskers, which are unique to each animal.",
      "\"Whiskers are like a human fingerprints,\" she says.",
      "By distinguishing between each creature\u2019s whisker tips, as well as their base and length, she hopes AI will enable wildlife experts to track and monitor individual members of the population.",
      "\u201cOver time this data will build up, allowing scientists and researchers to start tracking family lines,\u201d she says.",
      "There are already other examples of AI's ability to process huge amounts of data very quickly being useful for conservationists.",
      "For example, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) used the tech to analyse millions of photographs of a large area of Australia wiped out by bushfires, in order to find places where animals had survived.",

      "\"Sometimes we feel pressure to, but we would rather leave this to the experts.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:05:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Hi-tech coatings make all sorts of high performance engineering, like jet engines, possible.",
    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 20:47:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Dominique Pelicot, 72, is facing the maximum sentence for rape in a case that has horrified France.",
    "story": [
      "French prosecutors have demanded a 20-year jail sentence for Dominique Pelicot, who is accused of drugging his former wife Gis\u00e8le for a decade and inviting 50 men recruited online to rape her.",
      "Mr Pelicot, who has admitted to the charges, should also undergo medical treatment for 10 years, prosecutors said.",
      "Twenty years - the maximum sentence for rape under French law - \"is both a lot... and too little given the gravity of the acts that were committed and repeated,\" said prosecutor Laure Chabaud.",
      "Referring to an assessment of Mr Pelicot made by a psychiatrist earlier in the trial, Ms Chabaud said that the defendant presented \"multiple sexual deviances\".",
      "Verdicts and sentences are expected next month.",
      "\"He sought pleasure through a desire to submit, humiliate and debase his wife - the person he claimed to cherish the most in the world,\" Ms Chabaud told the court, saying that Mr Pelicot, 72, should be re-examined at the end of his sentence before being released.",
      "Another prosecutor, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mayet, said the trial had shaken up society and that what is at stake \"was not a conviction or an acquittal\" but \"to fundamentally change the relations between men and women\".",
      "Mr Mayet paid tribute to the \"courage and dignity\" of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who was in court as she has been most days since the trial began in September.",
      "Her decision to waive anonymity and have an open trial has led to a huge amount of interest in the case, which has in turn sparked a nationwide conversation on rape culture, consent and chemical submission - drugging someone for the purposes of coercion or assault.",
      "On Monday morning posters reading \"20 years for everyone\" had appeared on the walls around the Avignon courthouse where the trial is taking place.",
      "However, it is unlikely the 50 defendants in this extraordinary case will be handed sentences this long.",
      "The longest jail term requested by prosecutors today - excluding the 20-year demand made for Mr Pelicot - was for Jean-Pierre Marechal, a co-defendant who is not accused of raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, but who has admitted to drugging and raping his own ex-wife on Mr Pelicot's advice and instruction.",
      "He is facing 17 years in prison.",
      "Prosecutors also demanded 10 years for most of the other 19 defendants whose cases were examined today.",
      "The majority of the 50 accused deny the charges of rape, arguing that they cannot be guilty because they did not realise Ms Pelicot was unconscious when they were invited to the family\u2019s home by her husband, and therefore did not \"know\" they were raping her.",
      "But prosecutor Ms Chabaud said that \"in 2024 we can no longer maintain that because she didn't say anything, she consented.\"",
      "She added that neither the circumstances nor the behaviour of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot \"could have led these men to believe that she agreed to be subjected to these sexual acts in her lethargic state.\"",
      "Final phase for mass rape trial that has horrified France",
      "Man who drugged wife in French mass rape case told: You'll die alone",
      "In stifled sobs and fierce accusations, family falls apart at mass rape trial",
      "In an address to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, Prime Minister Michel Barnier said this trial was a watershed moment for the country's efforts to combat violence against women.",
      "\"I'm convinced that the Mazan trial will mark a before and after,\" he said.",
      "Mazan is the name of the village where the Pelicots lived and where Dominque Pelicot filmed the local men he had contacted online.",
      "The prime minister also announced a series of government measures to combat violence against women, including funding for pharmacies to dispense home drug test kits under a pilot scheme to fight chemical submission.",
      "Earlier on Monday, Equality Minister Salima Saa said the government was \u201cfully mobilised\u201d and announced the expansion of a system which allows victims of sexual violence to file complaints in hospitals and not just police stations.",
      "The system is currently used in 236 hospitals and will be extended to 377 by the end of next year.",
      "A new awareness campaign was also announced.",
      "The trial, which opened in early September, is now in its final stretch.",
      "Lawyers for the 50 defendants will make their closing arguments over the next three weeks, and a verdict is expected by 20 December."

      "The strong showing of Georgescu, who has no party of his own and campaigned largely on the social media platform TikTok, came as the biggest surprise of the election.",
      "The latest count suggests Lasconi is narrowly ahead of Ciolacu by around 2,000 votes and will face Georgescu in a final run-off for the presidency on 8 December.",
      "Ciolacu tended his resignation as leader of the Social Democrats on Monday morning.",
      "Political commentator Radu Magdin said the support for Georgescu was unprecedented, with earlier opinions polls placing him at around 5% of the vote.",

      "He previously condemned the Nato ballistic missile defence shield based at the Deveselu military base in southern Romania as \"a disgrace\".",
      "Georgescu was a prominent figure in another far-right party, George Simion\u2019s AUR (Alliance for the Union of Romanians), which eventually expelled him as too radical, after he praised leaders of the Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist movement during World War Two.",
      "But late on Sunday night, George Simion endorsed Georgescu, and urged the 1.3 million voters who voted for him on Sunday to support Georgescu in the run-off.",
      "Georgescu\u2019s success poses a dilemma for the millions of Romanians who voted for other candidates.",
      "If Elena Lasconi gets through to the second round, as expected, many supporters of the Social Democrats, especially in rural areas, would find it difficult to support such a liberal, progressive figure.",

      "Six years later, he charismatically came crashing into the front row of Namibian politics, challenging Geingob in the presidential election after saying the Swapo process for choosing its candidate was flawed.",
      "Itula\u2019s intervention in that election led to Swapo getting its lowest ever share \u2013 56% - in the presidential election and also losing its two-thirds majority in parliament.",
      "As someone who had a professional life outside politics, he has an appeal to the 50% of the 1.5 million voters who are under the age of 35, many of whom want economic change, a job or a measurable boost to their incomes.",

      "According to political analyst Henning Melber, the close rivalry between the two leading candidates could mean that the presidential election will go into an unprecedented second round run-off, which is required if no-one gets more than half of the votes cast.",

      "Swapo wants to avoid the same fate.",
      "The winner on Wednesday will be the candidate who can be most trusted on issues such as youth unemployment, corruption, health care, education and infrastructure improvement, while also being able to bolster the economy.",
      "This will need to happen without having to sell off the country's vast natural resources to foreign bidders - such as off-shore gas as well as lithium and other essential metals.",
      "Itula\u2019s IPC was not part of the elections in 2019, but has performed strongly in local elections since then and has the appearance of a credible political alternative. It has won praise for the way it has run some local governments.",

    "summary": "The deaths of six tourists sent shock waves through the backpacker scene in Vang Vieng.",
    "story": [
      "As the sun slowly dips behind the jagged peaks of Mount Nam Xay, a group of brightly coloured hot air balloons drift across the Vang Vieng valley.",
      "In the river below, young tourists laugh and splash each other from their kayaks.",
      "It\u2019s not hard to see what draws so many travellers here to this little town in central Laos. The scenery is stunning, the fun cheap and plentiful.",
      "But the town has found itself at the centre of an international scandal after six tourists died last week following suspected methanol poisoning.",
      "It is believed their alcoholic drinks may have contained methanol, an industrial chemical often used in bootleg alcohol.",
      "For the throngs of young western travellers on South East Asia\u2019s backpacker trail, Vang Vieng has become famous for what is called \u201ctubing.\u201d One described it to me as a water borne pub crawl.",
      "Groups of friends in swimsuits and bikinis clamber aboard huge inner tubes that would normally be used on trucks and drift downstream, pulling in from time to time at river side bars where vodka shots are liberally administered, before plunging back into the water.",
      "By the time they reach Vang Vieng everyone is fairly merry.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to give the tubing a miss\u201d two 27-year-old women from Hertfordshire in the UK tell me (they didn\u2019t want to give their names).",
      "\u201cThe vodka shots are part of the package, but no one wants to drink the local vodka right now.\u201d",
      "The pair arrived here from Vietnam, just as news of the deaths from methanol poisoning was spreading across the world.",
      "\u201cIn Vietnam we got free drinks, particularly when you\u2019re playing games in the evening,\u201d one of them tells me. \u201cAnd we just never thought about it, you just presume what they are giving you is safe. We\u2019ve drunk buckets before, but we are not going to take the risk again, and a lot of people here feel the same.\u201d",
      "\u201cBuckets\u201d are exactly what they sound like - small plastic buckets filled with cheap vodka and other liquor. Groups of friends share the mixture through long plastic straws.",
      "\u201cNow this has happened it really makes you think about it,\u201d the woman's friend says. \u201cYou wonder why are the drinks free? At the hostel associated with the deaths we heard they were giving free vodka and whisky shots for an hour each evening. I think if that happened in the UK you would definitely think it was dodgy.\u201d",
      "Both women said they are now sticking to drinking bottled or canned beer.",
      "The deaths of six tourists has sent shock waves through the backpacker scene. Young female travellers feel most vulnerable. The dead include Briton Simone White, 28, two young Australians, Holly Bowles and her best friend Bianca Jones, and two young Danish women, Anne-Sofie Orkild Coyman and Freja Vennervald Sorensen.",
      "Only one of the dead, a 57-year-old American, James Louis Hutson, was male. On the travellers\u2019 chat-groups many have been questioning whether only women\u2019s drinks had been spiked with methanol. The truth is, it\u2019s still a mystery.",
      "What we do know is all the victims stayed at the same place, The Nana Backpackers hostel. It\u2019s now been confirmed the American victim was found dead in his bedroom there on 13 November. On the same morning the two Danish victims were found unconscious in their rooms and rushed to the local hospital.",
      "Today, the Nana hostel is closed, the swimming pool that until a few days ago was hosting pool parties, is empty. A short walk away beside the river a bar called \u201cJaiDees\u201d has also been raided. The owners of both have forcefully denied serving any illegal or homemade alcohol.",
      "Out on the river there is little sign that the poisonings are stopping people coming to Vang Vieng. Late November is peak tourist season. The rainy season is over, the skies are clear and the temperature is a relatively cool 28C (82F).",
      "Along the main drag hostel owners told me they are fully booked. The young travellers from Europe and Australia are actually the minority. By far the largest groups are from neighbouring Thailand and China, the latter shuttling south on the newly finished Chinese-built Laos high-speed rail line.",
      "Vang Vieng is still a dusty rural town. But it\u2019s booming. Local business owners glide past in big black land cruisers and range rovers. As I walked back to my hotel on Saturday night, I was taken aback by the loud bark from the exhaust pipes of a Lamborghini cruising along Vang Vieng\u2019s single main street.",
      "Twenty years ago this was a sleepy little town surrounded by rice fields. Now it is being transformed by Thai and Chinese money. Fancy new hotels are springing up with riverside cocktail bars and infinity pools.",
      "But the young western backpackers are not here for the five-star experience, they come for the friendly anything-goes atmosphere.",
      "At a local motorbike rental I meet two fresh graduates from Sussex University.",
      "Ned from Somerset says he has no intention of cancelling plans because of what happened. \u201cPeople are scared for sure,\" he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t get the impression anyone is leaving. Everyone is still here having a good time.\"",
      "He adds: \"But everyone is also saying the same thing, don\u2019t drink the spirits, so people are being careful, there\u2019s definitely that feeling in the air, but I think it\u2019s actually quite safe now because all the bars are on edge, no-one wants to go to jail\u201d.",
      "His friend Jack is equally unflustered. \u201cWe\u2019ve come here to meet up with some friends and have some fun, and we\u2019re still going to do that,\" he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been here a week now and I can tell you the people here are absolutely lovely. They are some of the nicest people we\u2019ve met in all of South East Asia. So whatever happened, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything malicious about it.\u201d",
      "Malicious or not, six people are dead, five of them young women.",
      "The shock waves from what happened here has rippled out around the world to suburban homes from London to Melbourne, where worried parents with children on the backpacker trail are frantically messaging, checking where they are, and trying to persuade them not to go to Vang Vieng.",

      "Kennedy \u201cwill help make America healthy again by shaking up HHS and FDA\u201d, Colorado\u2019s Democratic Governor Jared Polis wrote on social media this week, welcoming his nomination. After receiving public backlash for praising him, Polis qualified his endorsement, writing on social media that \"science must remain THE cornerstone of our nation\u2019s health policy\".",
      "Making America Healthy Again",
      "Leading up to the election, Kennedy - a former Democrat - offered several ideas for tackling chronic diseases under his slogan \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d.",
      "He has frequently advocated for eliminating ultra-processed foods - products altered to include added fats, starches and sugars, like frozen pizzas, crisps and sugary breakfast cereals, that are linked to health problems like cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.",
      "He has taken aim primarily at school lunches, telling Fox News: \u201cWe have a generation of kids who are swimming around in a toxic soup right now.\"",
      "Part of Kennedy's new mandate will include overseeing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has over 18,000 employees.",
      "The agency is in charge of ensuring the safety of pharmaceuticals and the US food supply, but has come under fire in recent years from some lawmakers and consumer groups, who have accused it of a lack of transparency and action on food safety.",
      "The 70-year-old has pledged to take a sledgehammer to the agency, and fire employees he says are part of a \"corrupt system\".",
      "\u201cThere are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA \u2026 that have to go, that are not doing their job,\u201d Kennedy told MSNBC this month.",
      "He has also pushed for getting rid of food dyes, including Red No. 3, and other additives banned in other countries.",
      "The former Democrat has also singled out more controversial health issues, including fluoride in drinking water, which he says should be banned altogether, and raw milk, which he believes has health benefits despite the increased risk of bacterial contamination.",
      "He\u2019s also come after seed oils, writing on social media that Americans are being \u201cunknowingly poisoned\u201d by products like canola and sunflower oil that are used in fast foods.",
      "What the evidence says",
      "Several public health experts stand behind Kennedy\u2019s goal to tackle ultra-processed food, which they say the US eats at much higher rates than many other countries.",
      "\u201cIt is just thrilling to hear somebody argue for doing something about chronic disease,\u201d Ms Nestle said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s aim to get rid of certain food additives and dyes also could be beneficial, said Dr Peter Lurie, executive director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit group that advocates for food safety.",
      "The former FDA official said several food dyes, including Red No. 3 - which is banned in California - should also be blocked by the US government because of concerns about carcinogens.",
      "The FDA has pushed back on Kennedy\u2019s claim that the US allows thousands of additives that are banned in the European Union. A spokesperson said it was necessary \"to dig deeper and understand the context behind the numbers\" when comparing regulations in the US and EU, which use different methodologies.",
      "But public health experts and former officials said a number of Kennedy\u2019s goals were not worthwhile - and in some cases, harmful.",
      "For instance, drinking raw milk that has not been pasteurized - a process that helps kill bacteria - can make people sick or even kill them, research has found.",
      "\u201cThere's no evidence of any nutritional benefit of any magnitude that we know that comes from non-pasteurizing of milk,\u201d said Dr Lurie.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water also could be problematic, because fluoride, in the low levels found in water, has been proven to improve dental health, said University of Michigan nutritional sciences professor Jennifer Garner.",
      "Removing it from the water supply would also be out of his jurisdiction, because fluoride levels are controlled by states.",
      "And his claim that seed oils are helping drive the obesity epidemic is not based in science, either, Dr Lurie said.",
      "\u201cWe see no evidence for that. In fact, they seem like important products to the extent that they substitute for saturated fats\u201d such as butter, he said.",
      "Taking on Big Food",
      "Food reforms, while long part of the public health conversation, could also simply be unrealistic both politically and bureaucratically, some experts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal more complicated than he lets on,\u201d said Dr Lurie. \u201cThese are real challenges, and you will encounter industry opposition at every turn.\u201d",
      "For one, the FDA does not have authority over the catch-all of \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d, several former officials told the BBC.",
      "Instead, they said, the process is more complicated. Both the US Department of Agriculture and the FDA regulate the food industry. The FDA does not make the rules - it carries out policies passed by Congress and works to limit unhealthy foods by enforcing limits and labelling on certain nutrients, like sodium and saturated fat.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments \u201cmake for great political rhetoric\u201d, Ms Garner said. \u201cIn my view, I don\u2019t see how that could be feasible without drastic changes in other policy and infrastructure.\u201d",
      "He will also face industry backlash for proposals to ban pesticides and genetically modified organisms commonly used by American farmers, former FDA officials said.",
      "\u201cThe businesses will complain,\u201d said Rosalie Lijinsky, a former FDA official of 33 years.",
      "The industry is used to limited oversight from both Democrats and Republicans - including under Trump's first term - while many of Kennedy\u2019s goals would involve even more rulemaking.",
      "Several food industry groups met with lawmakers before Kennedy\u2019s appointment this month to lobby against him, Politico reported last month.",
      "Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, said this week that he planned to meet Kennedy before his confirmation hearing and \u201cspend a lot of time educating him about agriculture\u201d.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s position also puts him at odds with President-elect Trump, a longtime lover of fast food who worked to roll back stricter health requirements for school lunches during his first term.",
      "\u201cYou get some ideas that make a certain amount of sense, but they are exactly the kind to which this administration is hostile,\u201d Dr Lurie said.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Food Industry Association, which represents food retailers, producers and manufacturers, like General Mills, said it looked forward to working with Trump\u2019s team to \u201censure food and drug policy continues to be grounded in science, to reduce regulatory complexity\u201d.",
      "The industry complaints about Kennedy\u2019s agenda do not come as a surprise, said Jeff Hutt, a spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee, which is urging Republican lawmakers to confirm Kennedy.",
      "The goal of the health movement, Mr Hutt said, is \u201cprioritising the wellness of America over corporate profits\u201d.",
      "\u201cEven if the idea of banning ultra-processed food is not possible politically, it's a conversation that we need to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Pathway to change",
      "Kennedy still could work within existing US regulatory frameworks to improve America\u2019s food systems, former officials said.",
      "Ms Nestle said Kennedy could take on ultra-processed foods by altering the US Dietary Guidelines, which set nutritional standards for the industry and federal government programmes, including school lunches and military meals.",
      "\u201cThey have an enormous impact on the food industry,\u201d Ms Nestle said. \u201cThat would make a big difference.\u201d",
      "The guidelines are updated every five years by the US Department of Agriculture and DHHS, which has previously said there is not enough evidence against ultra-processed foods.",
      "Still, officials and nutrition experts raised concerns about the means by which Kennedy has proposed to enact his agenda, including firing the FDA\u2019s nutritionists.",
      "The move would have large ramifications for food safety, said Ms Lijinsky. \u201cIf you lose your top experts, you\u2019re going to have problems,\u201d she said.",
      "Ultimately, Ms Garner said it is difficult to disentangle some of Kennedy\u2019s more reasonable food-improvement goals with the false health claims he has spread.",
      "\u201cThere's an opportunity here,\u201d Ms Garner said.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 07:22:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win \u2013 but data shows that most voters picked someone else.",
    "story": [
      "Republican President-elect Donald Trump has said his election victory handed him an \u201cunprecedented and powerful\u201d mandate to govern.",
      "He beat Democratic rival Kamala Harris in all seven closely watched swing states, giving him a decisive advantage overall.",
      "Trump\u2019s party has also won both chambers of Congress, giving the returning president considerable power to enact his agenda.",
      "He has broadened his appeal across nearly all groups of voters since his 2020 defeat. And in doing so he pulled off a comeback unmatched by any previously defeated president in modern history.",
      "But the data suggests it was a much closer contest than he and his allies are suggesting.",
      "His communications director Steven Cheung has called it a \"landslide\" victory. Yet it emerged this week that his share of the vote has fallen below 50%, as counting continues.",
      "\"It feels grandiose to me that they're calling it a landslide,\" said Chris Jackson, senior vice-president in the US team of polling firm Ipsos.",
      "The Trump language suggested overwhelming victories, Jackson said, when in fact it was a few hundred-thousand votes in key areas that propelled Trump back to the White House.",
      "That is thanks to America\u2019s electoral college system, which amplifies relatively slender victories in swing states.",
      "Here are three ways to look at his win.",
      "Trump missed majority of voters by a hair",
      "With 76.9 million votes and counting, Trump won what is known as the popular vote, according to the latest tally by the BBC\u2019s US partner, CBS News.",
      "That means he scored more votes than Harris (74.4 million), or any other candidate. No Republican has managed that feat since 2004.",
      "But as vote-tallying continues in some parts of the US, he has now slipped a fraction of a percentage point below 50% in his vote share. He is not expected to make up the gap as counting goes on in places like Democratic-leaning California.",
      "This was also the case in 2016, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency despite losing the popular vote - having notched only 46% of the overall ballots cast.",
      "In 2024, Trump\u2019s win of both the popular vote and the presidency can be seen as an improvement on his last victory eight years ago.",
      "But Trump cannot say that he won the outright majority of the presidential votes that were cast in the election overall.",
      "To do so, he would need to have won more than 50%, as all victors have done for the last 20 years - other than Trump in 2016.",
      "For this reason, his claim to have a historic mandate \"may be overwrought\", suggested Chris Jackson of polling firm Ipsos, who said the language of Trump and his supporters was a tactic being used to \"justify the sweeping actions they're planning to take once they have control of the government\".",
      "His electoral college win was resounding",
      "On a different metric, Trump\u2019s win over Harris in 2024 appears more comfortable. He won 312 votes in the US electoral college compared with Harris\u2019s 226.",
      "And this is the number that really matters. The US election is really 50 state-by-state races rather than a single national one.",
      "The winner in any given state wins all of its electoral votes - for example, 19 in swing state Pennsylvania. Both candidates hoped to reach the magic number of 270 electoral votes to earn a majority in the college.",
      "Trump\u2019s 312 is better than Joe Biden's 306 and beats both Republican wins by George W Bush. But it is well shy of the 365 achieved by Barack Obama in 2008 or the 332 Obama won getting re-elected, or the colossal 525 by Ronald Reagan in 1984.",
      "And it is important to remember that the \u201cwinner takes all\u201d mechanic of the electoral college means that relatively slender wins in some critical areas can be amplified into what looks like a much more resounding triumph.",
      "What is the US electoral college, and how does it work?",
      "What is the US electoral college, and how does it work?",
      "Trump is ahead by just over 230,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the latest numbers from CBS. All three states were the focus of intensive campaigning by both parties ahead of the 5 November vote.",
      "If just over 115,000 voters in that group had instead picked Harris, she would have won those Rust Belt swing states, giving her enough votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.",
      "That might sound like a lot of people but the number is a drop in the ocean of the more-than-150 million votes that were cast nationwide.",
      "In other swing states in the Sun Belt - namely Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina - the margins of victory for Trump were much more comfortable.",
      "But when looking at the power wielded by the Republicans more broadly, their majority in the US House, the lower chamber of Congress, remains slender.",

      "'It's simple, really' - why Latinos voted for Trump",

      "There is another measure with which to consider Trump\u2019s win, which is to look at the number of votes he received, although this is a relatively crude measure.",
      "The 76.9 million that he has amassed so far is the second-highest tally in American history.",
      "It is important to remember that the US population, and therefore the electorate, is constantly growing. The more-than-150 million people who voted in the US this year is more than double the number of 74 million who went to the polls in 1964.",
      "That makes comparisons through time tricky. But it was only four years ago that the record haul was achieved.",
      "Biden won 81.3 million votes on his way to the White House in 2020 - a year of historic voter turnout when Trump was again on the ticket.",
      "Although the Republicans made important breakthroughs in 2024, the Democrats also failed to connect with voters, said Jackson, who put the trend down to Americans' wish to return to \"2019 prices\" after a years-long cost-of-living squeeze.",

      "The president-elect also announced White House roles for Alex Wong and Sebastian Gorka who also served during Trump's first term.",
      "How will Bessent lead US Treasury?",
      "If his nomination to lead the Treasury department is confirmed by the Senate, Bessent would almost immediately be plunged into the fight in Washington over extending the tax cuts from Trump's first term.",
      "Trump has also called for controversial changes to trade policy, proposing sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the country.",
      "Such ideas have been met with alarm in traditional economic and corporate circles.",
      "In an interview with Fox News shortly before the election, Bessent said ensuring the tax cuts do not expire as planned at the end of next year would be his top priority, if he ended up in the administration.",
      "\"If it doesn\u2019t happen, this will be the largest tax increase in US history,\" he warned.",
      "For other posts, Trump has been willing to back candidates with minimal experience in favour of loyalty and apparent conviction in his pledges.",
      "But he has appeared more hesitant to buck convention at the Treasury Department, which serves as a key liaison between the White House and Wall Street and has critical functions that include collecting taxes, supervising banks, wielding sanctions and handling US government debt.",
      "In his announcement, Trump said Bessent would \u201chelp curb the unsustainable path of Federal Debt\u201d. That issue has long been a priority for traditional Republicans, but financial markets see an increase in debt as a risk in a second Trump term.",
      "Bessent, a native of South Carolina, made his name in the 1990s betting against the British pound and Japanese yen while working for Soros, a major Democratic donor.",

      "He and his husband, a former New York City prosecutor, married in 2011 and have two children. He is known for philanthropy in South Carolina, where his family has deep roots.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 21:33:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Use of social media was a key factor in his victory in the first round of Romania's presidential election.",
    "story": [
      "An independent candidate with a nationalist background has stunned Romania and alarmed its allies by coming first in the initial round of the presidential elections on Sunday.",
      "Calin Georgescu is a 62-year-old expert on sustainable development and agriculture, with no party of his own, but a background in the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) nationalist movement.",
      "His programme calls for a radical transformation of Romania, to one based on small-scale organic agriculture, Christian values, and national sovereignty. His programme has similarities to that of Robert F Kennedy Jr in the US - Donald Trump\u2019s pick for health secretary - who has pledged to \"make America healthy again\". Some of his videos on TikTok show him bathing in icy water.",
      "Georgescu bases his own expertise on his past work in the Romanian Foreign Ministry, and in a number of think tanks and NGOs linked to the United Nations.",
      "One key to his sudden popularity is his promise to \"restore Romania\u2019s dignity\" and end subservience to the international organisations it belongs to, including Nato and the EU.",
      "The post of president in Romania is significant, with considerable influence on foreign policy. Romania has been a staunch US ally and Nato member, and hosts US Nato bases which play an important logistical role in monitoring the war in neighbouring Ukraine.",
      "Considerable Western military support for Ukraine passes through Romania, though few details are given due to national security concerns. Georgescu has criticised the US-supplied missile shield at Deveselu as \"a diplomatic embarrassment\", and questioned its defensive role  - echoing the Kremlin narrative, which describes the base as an example of Nato aggression towards Russia.",
      "\"Romania will respect its obligations towards the alliances, organisations and partnerships of which it is a member,\" reads point 13 of Georgescu\u2019s campaign programme for this election, \"to the extent that they will respect their obligations towards Romania\".",
      "Far-right candidate takes shock lead in Romania presidential election",
      "Romanian village set to become Nato's biggest airbase in Europe",
      "Romania country profile",
      "In a TV interview in May 2018, he called Russian President Putin one of the few politicians in the world who is \"a true leader\". This has earned him a reputation as a pro-Russian politician, though there is little other evidence. His victory on Sunday was warmly welcomed in several Russian media, including Sputnik, Russia Today and RIA Novosti. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, remarked obliquely that \"he had never heard of him\".",
      "Other international comparisons have been made with Hungary\u2019s veteran prime minister, Viktor Orban, whom he is said to admire. The two men could find common ground, in their demand for an end to the war in Ukraine, and the importance of restoring peace in Europe.",
      "Some of his most controversial remarks concern two leaders of the Romanian Iron Guard, a fascist and mystically Christian movement in Romania between 1927 and 1944, whom he described as \"heroes\". This led to his expulsion from George Simion\u2019s AUR.",
      "Nevertheless Georgescu denies that his programme is in any way antisemitic or xenophobic.",
      "A key factor in his victory on Sunday was his adept use of social media, especially TikTok, where he has more than 330,000 followers - up from 30,000 a fortnight ago - and more than 4m likes. That translated into over two million votes in this election."

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 22:16:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Delhi gets all the attention, but other parts of northern India are also dealing with toxic air.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cWhen I stepped out of my house, it felt like I was inhaling smoke,\u201d says Imran Ahmed Ali, a lawyer in the northern Indian city of Chandigarh.",
      "Pollution levels in Chandigarh - India's first planned city, located about 240km (150 miles) from capital Delhi - have been at more than 15 times the safe limit recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for more than a month.",
      "It is now common for air quality in the city to dip every winter, but Mr Ali says he has never felt so sick before.",
      "A few weeks ago, the 31-year-old began experiencing a dry cough and shortness of breath, which he initially dismissed as symptoms of a seasonal cold. But as the temperature dropped, his chest congestion worsened and he went to a doctor.",
      "\u201cAfter running several tests, the doctor told me that my symptoms were caused by pollution. I\u2019m now taking medicine twice a day to manage my breathing,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Ali is among hundreds of millions of people living in northern India who are forced to breathe toxic polluted air for extended periods every winter.",
      "According to Swiss firm IQAir, eight of the 10 most polluted cities in the world last year were located in the Indo-Gangetic plains - a densely populated region which stretches across northern and eastern India, along with parts of Pakistan and Nepal.",
      "A recent report by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago reiterates that the northern plains - home to 540.7 million people across Bihar, Chandigarh, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal - is the most polluted region in India. When compared with the WHO's standards, air pollution at current levels could reduce the life expectancy of people here by 5.4 years, it adds.",
      "But as the toxic smog closes in every winter, headlines and attention are mostly focused on Delhi.",
      "Delhi receives significant attention due to its position as the capital of India, says Partha Basu, strategic adviser at the Environmental Defense Fund, a non-profit group focused on delivering climate solutions.",
      "Every year, the Delhi government implements an annual action plan, which includes measures such as driving restrictions and a ban on construction activities during peak pollution periods.",
      "Even though there is criticism that this isn't enough, most other places in northern India have not seen such proactive steps.",
      "Mr Basu says that often, people don't associate other parts of northern India - particularly villages and small towns and cities - with high pollution.",
      "\"In [people's] minds, villages are clean, green and pristine - but that\u2019s far from the reality,\" he says.",
      "Living in Delhi smog is like watching a dystopian film again and again",
      "Living in Delhi smog is like watching a dystopian film again and again",
      "Pollution in the region is not caused by a single factor, but a combination of elements - such as construction activities, vehicular emissions, industrial pollutants and the seasonal burning of crop residue.",
      "While many of these factors are present throughout the year, the difference in the winter months - from October to January - is the weather conditions.",
      "The air quality worsens each winter because cold stagnant air traps pollutants near the ground, making it harder for them to disperse, says Mahesh Palawat, vice president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet.",
      "The landlocked geography of the Indo-Gangetic Plain worsens the situation. The region is surrounded by mountains and lacks strong winds, which normally help blow polluted air away.",
      "Doctors and health experts warn of the risks of breathing in these pollutants.",
      "\"Patients complain of a burning sensation in their eyes and throat when they step outside. Some face difficulty in breathing,\" says Dr Rajesh Gupta, director of the pulmonary department at Fortis Hospital in Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh state.",
      "Dr Gupta says that people who are otherwise healthy also develop respiratory troubles this time of the year, and that children and the elderly are especially vulnerable.",
      "The bleak conditions also exact a mental toll. Aditi Garg, who works in Meerut town - about 100km from Delhi - used to cherish the quiet moments on her balcony each morning.",
      "That routine has been disrupted completely.",
      "Since mid-October, pollution levels in Meerut have remained at levels classified as \"poor\" or \"severe\", making it difficult to breathe.",
      "Ms Garg now spends nearly all her time indoors, next to her air purifier, trying to shield herself from the toxic air outside.",
      "\"I don't have an option but to stay inside, this is the best I can do,\" she says.",
      "And not everyone has the privilege of staying indoors.",
      "In Uttar Pradesh alone, more than 83 million people are registered as employees in the unorganised sector. The actual number is likely to be much higher.",
      "This includes daily wage workers, street vendors and agricultural labourers who have no choice but to work outdoors, risking their health.",
      "Standing outside his shanty in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Kanpur city, Mohammad Salim Siddiqui gasps for breath as he speaks.",
      "An automobile spare parts vendor and the sole breadwinner of his family, Mr Siddiqui has to brave the pollution every day.",
      "\"Two members of my family are struggling with respiratory problems because of the pollution,\" says Mr Siddiqui, adding that it's particularly bad in crowded slums.",
      "\"We need help,\" he says.",
      "Over the years, governments in some states have made efforts to counter the pollution problem.",
      "In 2019, India launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) with an aim to reduce particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5, tiny particles that can enter the lungs and cause diseases) levels by 20-30% by 2026 as compared to 2017 levels.",
      "The goal was later updated to reduce PM10 levels up to 40% by 2026.",
      "Under this programme, 131 Indian cities - including many in the Indo-Gangetic Plains - were to develop tailored plans to address local pollution sources.",
      "While it has helped raise awareness and set goals, experts say stronger action and better coordination between local and state governments are needed to make a real difference.",
      "Mr Basu says that the lack of dialogue remains the biggest barrier against meaningful change.",
      "Both Ms Garg and Mr Ali echo this, saying there is barely any conversation about the toxic air quality in their cities.",
      "\"People have unfortunately accepted this as a part of their lives,\" says Mr. Ali.",
      "\"It's a discussion they have every year when pollution is at its peak, and then conveniently forget about - until next time.\"",

    "story": [
      "At the epicentre of this devastating family drama is Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, a diminutive 72-year-old woman, drugged by her former husband and abused for a decade by dozens of strangers he had recruited online.",
      "Watching her entering the court in Avignon and giving evidence, it was staggering to imagine the amount of abuse her body sustained.",
      "But as other members of her family have taken the stand, it has become painfully clear that no-one has emerged unscathed from the storm unleashed by the actions of the Pelicot patriarch.",
      "The damage to this family is clear. Individually, they have described the destructive force that engulfed them in November 2020 as a \u201ctsunami\u201d that left nothing but ruin in its wake.",
      "Dominique Pelicot was finally caught after an alert security guard caught him filming under women\u2019s skirts.",
      "But it took weeks for police to discover the full truth that ultimately tore his family apart.",
      "Warning: This story contains details some readers may find disturbing",
      "For years, he had been drugging his wife and recruiting men online to rape her while  she was unconscious.",
      "He filmed the abuse and neatly classified each visit in folders on his hard drive. Faced with the evidence, Dominique Pelicot admitted the rape charges against him.",
      "Alongside obscene language describing his videos, he added captions with the men\u2019s names. Fifty other men have been on trial with him and only a handful admit rape. More than 20 others could not be identified and are still at large.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has attended almost all of this trial. She waived her anonymity and allowed the public to see what she had endured.",
      "The videos leave no doubt that the sex acts were not consensual. Ms Pelicot can be seen lying on the bed, snoring, as her husband whispers instructions to various men to touch her, prod her, use her.",
      "Artificial sleep affords her mind a degree of protection, but her body becomes an object.",
      "She was, in her own words, treated \u201clike a rag doll, like a garbage bag\u201c.",
      "\"I am 72 now and I don't know how much time I have left,\u201d she told the court last week.",
      "'You will die lying'",
      "The magnitude of Dominique Pelicot\u2019s betrayal and crimes is such that the aftershocks have rippled far beyond his ex-wife.",
      "The Pelicots\u2019 middle child, Caroline Darian, now 45, screamed her anguish at her father in court as she demanded to know the truth about photos found on his computer. Entitled \u201cMy naked daughter\u201d, the images show her semi-naked and, she says, clearly drugged.",
      "Mr Pelicot has offered various and at times contradictory explanations for the pictures, although he has denied abusing his daughter. \u201cI never touched you,\u201d he pleaded with her.",
      "But his duplicity has been abundantly exposed during this trial, and he has clearly lost the right to be believed by his daughter.",
      "\u201cYou are a liar,\u201d she shouted back at him. \u201cI am sick of your lies, you are alone in your lie, you will die lying.\u201d",
      "Fighting back tears, she accused her father of looking at her \u201cwith incestuous eyes\u201d.",
      "Caroline Darian has told the court she feels she is the trial\u2019s \u201cforgotten victim\u201d as, unlike her mother\u2019s case, there is no record of the abuse she is convinced was inflicted on her.",
      "She has founded a charity to highlight the dangers of drug-induced assault and published a book in 2022 detailing her family\u2019s trauma. In it, she hinted at a rift with her mother, who she found had dropped off a bundle of warm clothes for her father in jail, weeks after his crimes came to light.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Caroline wrote. \u201cShe was still looking after the person who got her raped for a decade.\u201d",
      "That apparent rift was exploited by a combative defence lawyer who suggested Gis\u00e8le Pelicot had chosen her former husband over her daughter by not demanding the truth about the photos of Caroline. Gis\u00e8le shook her head, but Caroline cracked a slight smile, appearing to acknowledge the lawyer's description.",
      "When Caroline\u2019s brothers David and Florian took the stand they made repeated references to the pain she was going through, urging their father to tell the truth.",
      "Stifling sobs, Florian, 38, the youngest of the family, turned to face Dominique Pelicot sitting in a glass box to his left and said: \u201cIf you have any dignity and humanity \u2013 you don\u2019t have anything left to lose anyway \u2013 tell Caroline the truth.\u201d",
      "He also spoke of his longstanding suspicion he was the product of an affair his mother had in the 1980s, which was compounded by a faint but lifelong feeling that his father loved his siblings more than him.",
      "In a desperate search for answers, he wondered out loud whether he could be the \u201cmotive\u201d for his father\u2019s crimes. He said he would seek out a paternity test, adding it would be a \u201crelief\u201d not to be Dominique Pelicot\u2019s son.",
      "Through tears, Florian painted a desolate picture of what his life had become. His marriage to the mother of his three children, Aurore, has not survived revelations that Dominique Pelicot also surreptitiously took photographs of her.",
      "Despite their separation, this slight, softly-spoken woman has frequently attended the trial and said it had exposed the \u201cbanality\u201d of abuse.",
      "Aurore, herself a survivor of incest, is having to live with the regret of not having listened to her instincts regarding Mr Pelicot. \u201cIf she had, she may have been able to alter the course of events,\u201d her lawyer said.",
      "'My childhood has disappeared'",
      "The eldest of the Pelicot children, David, is a burly man of 50 who bears a striking resemblance to his father.",
      "Taking the stand this week, he described how he had grown closer to Dominique Pelicot when he had himself become a father.",
      "Then, his voice growing more anguished and clutching the stand as if to steady himself, he recalled the harrowing detail the night his mother told him of his father\u2019s arrest. \u201cAll of us know where we were when the tsunami hit,\u201d he said.",
      "Naked photographs of his wife Celine, pregnant with their twin daughters, were also found among Mr Pelicot\u2019s files. She was in the bathroom, snapped with a hidden camera.",
      "His voice heavy with emotion, David described watching his mother, frail and lost, standing on a train platform, her life reduced to her dog and a suitcase.",
      "Recalling the birthday parties his parents used to throw for him and his siblings, to the envy of their friends, he said: \u201cMy childhood has disappeared; it was erased.\u201d",
      "The trauma rippling through this family seems without end. David\u2019s son, now 18, wonders what really happened when Dominique asked him to \u201cplay doctor\u201d as a child.",
      "His young siblings, the family\u2019s lawyer said on Wednesday, \u201cwill have to find their place in a family in which their grandmother, their mother, their brother and their aunts have all been victims of their grandfather.\u201d",
      "Caroline\u2019s young son is still profoundly shaken by the carefully worded revelation, four years ago, that his beloved grandfather hurt his grandmother.",
      "\u201cThis is just a sample of the depth of the suffering caused by a rape in the family,\u201d lawyer St\u00e9phane Babonneau said in his closing arguments.",
      "A verdict is expected on 20 December. Mr Pelicot is facing 20 years in jail \u2013 the maximum sentence for rape in France.",
      "And for the rest of his family the trauma will live on. Because none of them will ever know for certain what he may or may not have done.",
      "In one of the shaky phone videos shown in court, a tall naked man stands in the middle of a dark bedroom. Another man sits on the bed, smiling, next to an unconscious woman lying on her side, lightly snoring.",

      "None of the women or officials we spoke to during our investigation know for sure what is in these drugs. But some women have told us they led to changes in their bodies - such as swollen stomachs - which further convinced them they were pregnant.",
      "Women given the \u201ctreatment\u201d are warned not to visit any conventional doctors or hospitals, as no scan or pregnancy test would detect \u201cthe baby\u201d, which the scammers claim is growing outside the womb.",

      "Authorities tell us that to complete the \u201ctreatment\u201d, the scammers need new-born babies and to do that they seek out women who are desperate and vulnerable, many of them young and pregnant, in a country where abortion is illegal.",
      "In February 2024, the Anambra state health ministry raided the facility where Chioma \u201cdelivered\u201d Hope.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 05:30:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Faced with a housing and homelessness crisis, Halifax has set aside city sites for people to live in tents. Not everyone is behind the plan.",
    "story": [
      "As cities across North America grapple with homelessness, one Canadian city has taken a different approach by regulating tent encampments instead of banning them, as it tries to tackle what one official calls the issue \"of the decade\".",
      "Andrew Goodsell has called his small orange tent on a grassy patch in downtown Halifax home for almost a year.",
      "In late October, on a park bench outside his makeshift dwelling, the 38-year-old described life at the homeless encampment where he lives with about a dozen or so others as \u201cdepressing\u201d.",
      "\u201cI wake up in an area I don\u2019t want to be,\u201d Mr Goodsell said, as a stream of cars drove by.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d much rather wake up in a spot where I could take a shower and maybe make myself something to eat. But I\u2019ll still get myself out of bed.\u201d",
      "Mr Goodsell has been without a home on-and-off for a decade.",
      "He once got by with couch surfing or working minimum-wage jobs to pay rent, but with Halifax\u2019s skyrocketing housing costs, he can no longer afford a place to live.",
      "His encampment is one of nine sites chosen by the city as a place where people without housing can lawfully camp outside. The sites were approved this summer as a temporary, but some argue necessary, solution while indoor shelters are at-capacity.",
      "The policy has been adopted by at least one other municipality in Canada and is being considered by others who too are facing a rise in homelessness.",
      "It's in stark contrast to other North American cities where police officers forcibly remove homeless encampments. These so-called \"street sweeps\" have been criticised as violent and ineffective in addressing the housing crisis.",
      "But they have become increasingly popular as homelessness has grown since the pandemic. California has cleared more than 12,000 encampments since 2021, while cities like Fresno, California and Grants Pass, Oregon have passed complete bans on camping in public spaces.",
      "Proponents of banning encampments say that the campsites lead to disorder, and that funding should go to getting people off the streets.",
      "Among detractors of Halifax's approach are some encampment residents themselves, who say they want resources spent on affordable housing instead.",
      "\u201cCanada is one of the richest, most beautiful countries around,\u201d Mr Goodsell said. \u201cWe have so much land, so much resource, but we must be one of the greediest countries out there.\u201d",
      "Although several Canadian cities, including Halifax, have tried to remove homeless encampments in the past, recent court decisions in British Columbia and Ontario have ruled that people without homes can camp outside if there are no appropriate indoor shelters available.",
      "In contrast, the US Supreme Court ruled in June that cities can fine and arrest homeless people, even if there is no shelter for them to go to, paving the way for the outright bans on encampments in California and Oregon.",
      "Another difference is the growing recognition in Canada that previous approaches have failed, says Stepan Wood, a law professor at the University of British Columbia, who has studied the issue.",
      "\u201cThe approach up until a couple years ago had been to clear them out, but it\u2019s now no longer deniable that that doesn\u2019t solve the problem,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "Canada's national database estimates that there are 235,000 homeless people across the country in a given year, though experts argue that number is higher.",
      "This figure puts the rate of homelessness in Canada above that of the US and England, according to a comparison of official data. Globally, many cities have seen a rise in homelessness since the pandemic.",
      "In 2018, Halifax - the largest city on Canada\u2019s Atlantic Coast with a population of around 518,000 - only had 18 people sleeping rough, said Max Chauvin, the director of housing and homelessness in Halifax. Now it's over 200.",
      "While Halifax has approved nine designated encampment sites, only five are operating. Each has a proposed limit of up to a dozen tents, but most are over capacity.",
      "The city provides the sites with portable toilets, while outreach workers come by weekly to drop off bottled water and check in on people, encampment residents told the BBC.",
      "Sometimes they will bring things that residents need, like a coat, or a warmer sleeping bag for the winter.",
      "Mr Chauvin said the designated encampments are born out of a realisation that the city has run out of options to immediately address its housing crisis.",
      "The city is waiting for the provincial government to ramp up affordable housing construction. Nova Scotia has not built any new public housing units since 1995.",
      "In the meantime, \u201cthe question becomes: 'Where are people going to go?'\u201d Mr Chauvin said.",
      "He believes solving the housing crisis will be \u201cthe item of the decade\u201d for his city and others.",
      "\u201cOne of the largest groups of homelessness we see growing is simply people who don't have enough money to pay rent, and that\u2019s new,\u201d he said, adding that includes seniors, students, and entire families.",
      "Mr Chauvin also points to a lack of accessible healthcare for people with mental and physical illnesses.",
      "Proponents of the designated sites say they prevent the criminalisation of people who are homeless and allow the city to concentrate its outreach services.",
      "Still, Halifax's policy is both provisional and divisive.",
      "It was a focal point of the city\u2019s October mayoral election, where the winner promised to end the expansion of designated encampments and to remove unlawful ones.",
      "Trish Purdy, a city councillor, unsuccessfully fought to remove a proposed designated site in her district, after hearing from constituents who feared it would bring crime and drug use.",
      "She acknowledged that the issue is socially and morally complex, but said she believes allowing people to live in \u201chorrible conditions\u201d is not \u201cempathetic or compassionate\u201d.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure the residents who live by any of the encampments could tell you they didn\u2019t receive any empathy or compassion when the encampments were placed on their doorstep,\u201d Ms Purdy told the BBC.",
      "One such encampment in Dartmouth, a Halifax suburb, sits adjacent to a row of public housing units, where residents complain of needle debris, violence and disputes with those living at the site.",
      "\u201cThis used to be a fun field where the kids can come out and play baseball or kickball,\u201d said Clarissa, a mother of three who declined to give her last name.",
      "\u201cNow we can\u2019t even do that, because we\u2019re too worried about stepping on a needle.\u201d",
      "Clarissa said she and her neighbours were not consulted about the encampment  and believes the site was chosen because their neighbourhood is low-income.",
      "But Ames Mathers, who lives near another encampment, called its residents her neighbours.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really messed up that people are having to live in parks at all as an only option for housing,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a housing crisis, and our province and city are dropping the ball.\u201d",
      "Some encampment residents told the BBC they welcomed knowing they wouldn't be asked to leave at a moment's notice. But many said they themselves didn't always feel safe at the sites.",
      "They also question the government's willingness to find them housing, saying they have received more help from volunteers than officials. They note that multiple high-rise condominiums are under development in Halifax - none of which, they say, are affordable.",
      "\u201cWe would like to be treated like people,\u201d said Samantha Nickerson, who lived with her fiance, Trent Smith, at the same encampment as Mr Goodsell.",
      "\u201cSome of us really are trying hard to get our lives back together and work.\u201d",
      "Ms Nickerson and Mr Smith, who are in their 30s, said they faced violence from other residents and were often verbally harassed by members of the public.",
      "\u201cWe understand that this is an eyesore, and nobody wants it,\u201d Ms Nickerson said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be here. We don\u2019t want to be in this situation.\u201d",
      "By mid-November, the couple had been moved to a temporary indoor shelter with the help of volunteers.",
      "Mr Goodsell and a handful of others remain at site, which was recently de-designated over concerns it would be in the way of snow-clearing operations.",
      "He said he has not been offered indoor shelter and does not want to be uprooted to another encampment.",

    "title": "Why Indians are risking it all to chase the American Dream",
    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 00:11:49 GMT",
    "summary": "A surge in illegal border crossings by Indians into the US has left many puzzled -what\u2019s going on?",
    "story": [
      "In October, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) sent a chartered flight carrying Indian nationals back home, marking a growing trend in deportations to India.",
      "This was no ordinary flight - it was one of multiple large-scale \u201cremoval flights\u201d carried out this year, each typically carrying more than 100 passengers. The flights were returning groups of Indian migrants who \"did not establish a legal basis to remain in the US\".",
      "According to US officials, the latest flight carrying adult men and women was routed to Punjab, close to many deportees' places of origin. No precise breakdown of hometowns was provided.",
      "In the US fiscal year 2024 which ended in September, more than 1,000 Indian nationals had been repatriated by charter and commercial flights, according to Royce Bernstein Murray, assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\u201cThat has been part of a steady increase in removals from the US of Indian nationals over the past few years, which corresponds with a general increase in encounters that we have seen with Indian nationals in the last few years as well,\u201d Ms Murray told a media briefing. (Encounters refer to instances where non-citizens are stopped by US authorities while attempting to cross the country\u2019s borders with Mexico or Canada.)",
      "As the US ramps up repatriations of Indian nationals, concerns grow about how President-elect Donald Trump's immigration policies will affect them. Trump has already promised the biggest deportation of migrants in history.",
      "Since October 2020, US Customs and Border Protection (CPB) officials have detained nearly 170,000 Indian migrants attempting unauthorised crossings at both the northern and southern land borders.",
      "\u201cThough smaller than the numbers from Latin America and the Caribbean, Indian nationals represent the largest group of migrants from outside the Western Hemisphere encountered by the CPB in the past four years,\u201d say Gil Guerra and Sneha Puri, immigration analysts at Niskanen Center, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "As of 2022, an estimated 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants were in the US, making them the third-largest group after those from Mexico and El Salvador, according to new data from the Pew Research Center. Unauthorised immigrants in all make up 3% of US\u2019s total population and 22% of the foreign-born population.",
      "Looking at the data, Mr Guerra and Ms Puri have identified notable trends in the spike in Indians attempting illegal border crossings.",
      "For one, the migrants are not from the lowest economic strata. But they cannot secure tourist or student visas to the US, often due to lower education or English proficiency.",
      "Instead, they rely on agencies charging up to $100,000 (\u00a379,000), sometimes using long and arduous routes designed to dodge border controls. To afford this, many sell farms or take out loans. Not surprisingly, data from the US immigration courts in 2024 reveals that the majority of Indian migrants were male, aged 18-34.",
      "Second, Canada on the northern border has become a more accessible entry point for Indians, with a visitor visa processing time of 76 days (compared to up to a year for a US visa in India).",
      "The Swanton Sector - covering the states of Vermont and counties in New York and New Hampshire - has experienced a sudden surge in encounters with Indian nationals since early this year, peaking at 2,715 in June, the researchers found.",
      "Earlier, most irregular Indian migrants entered the Americas through the busier southern border with Mexico via El Salvador or Nicaragua, both of which facilitated migration. Until November last year, Indian nationals enjoyed visa-free travel to El Salvador.",
      "\u201cThe US-Canada border is also longer and less guarded than the US-Mexico border. And while it is not necessarily safer, criminal groups do not have the same presence there as they do along the route from South and Central America,\u201d Mr Guerra and Ms Puri say.",
      "Thirdly, much of the migration appears to originate from the Sikh-dominated Indian state of Punjab and neighbouring Haryana, which has traditionally seen people migrating overseas. The other source of origin is Gujarat, the home state of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "Punjab, which accounts for a large share of irregular Indian migrants, is facing economic hardships, including high unemployment, farming distress and a looming drug crisis.",
      "Migration has also long been common among Punjabis, with rural youth still eager to move abroad.",
      "A recent study of 120 respondents in Punjab by Navjot Kaur, Gaganpreet Kaur and Lavjit Kaur found that 56% emigrated between ages 18-28, often after secondary education. Many funded their move through non-institutional loans, later sending remittances to their families.",
      "Then there has been a rise in tensions over the separatist Khalistan movement, which seeks to establish an independent homeland for Sikhs. \u201cThis has caused fear from some Sikhs in India about being unfairly targeted by authorities or politicians. These fears may also provide a credible basis for claims of persecution that allows them to seek asylum, whether or not true,\u201d says Ms Puri.",
      "But pinning down the exact triggers for migration is challenging.",
      "\u201cWhile motivations vary, economic opportunity remains the primary driver, reinforced by social networks and a sense of pride in having family members 'settled' in the US,\u201d says Ms Puri.",
      "Fourth, researchers found a shift in the family demographics of Indian nationals at the borders.",
      "More families are trying to cross the border. In 2021, single adults were overwhelmingly detained at both borders. Now, family units make up 16-18% of the detentions at both borders.",
      "This has sometimes led to tragic consequences. In January 2022, an Indian family of four - part of a group of 11 people from Gujarat - froze to death just 12m (39ft) from the border in Canada while attempting to enter the US.",
      "Pablo Bose, a migration and urban studies scholar at the University of Vermont, says Indians are trying to cross into the US in larger numbers because of more economic opportunities and \u201cmore ability to enter the informal economies in the US cities\u201d, especially the large ones like New York or Boston.",
      "\u201cFrom everything I know and interviews I have conducted, most of the Indians are not staying in the more rural locations like Vermont or upstate New York but rather heading to the cities as soon as they can,\u201d Mr Bose told the BBC. There, he says, they are entering mostly informal jobs like domestic labour and restaurant work.",
      "Things are likely to become more difficult soon. Veteran immigration official Tom Homan, who will be in charge of the country's borders following Trump's inauguration in January, has said that the northern border with Canada is a priority because illegal migration in the area is a \u201chuge national security issue\u201d.",
      "What happens next is unclear. \u201cIt remains to be seen if Canada would impose similar policies to prevent people migrating into the US from its borders. If that happens, we can expect a decline in detentions of Indians nationals at the border,\u201d says Ms Puri.",
      "Whatever the case, the dreams driving thousands of desperate Indians to seek a better life in the US are unlikely to fade, even as the road ahead becomes more perilous."

    "story": [
      "When large swathes of invasive seaweed started washing up on Caribbean beaches in 2011, local residents were perplexed.",
      "Soon, mounds of unsightly sargassum \u2013 carried by currents from the Sargasso Sea and linked to climate change \u2013 were carpeting the region\u2019s prized coastlines, repelling holidaymakers with the pungent stench emitted as it rots.",
      "Precisely how to tackle it was a dilemma of unprecedented proportions for the tiny tourism-reliant islands with limited resources.",
      "In 2018, Barbados\u2019 Prime Minister Mia Mottley declared sargassum a national emergency.",
      "Now, a pioneering group of Caribbean scientists and environmentalists hope to turn the tide on the problem by transforming the troublesome algae into a lucrative biofuel.",
      "They recently launched one of the world\u2019s first vehicles powered by bio-compressed natural gas. The innovative fuel source created at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in Barbados also uses wastewater from local rum distilleries, and dung from the island\u2019s indigenous blackbelly sheep which provides the vital anaerobic bacteria.",
      "The team says any car can be converted to run on the gas via a simple and affordable four-hour installation process, using an easily available kit, at a total cost of around $2,500 (\u00a31,940).",
      "Researchers had initially looked into using sugarcane to reduce reliance on costly, imported fossil fuels and help steer the Caribbean towards its ultimate target of zero emissions.",
      "However, despite Barbados being one of few islands still producing sugarcane, the quantity was deemed insufficient for the team\u2019s ambitious goals, explains the project\u2019s founder Dr Legena Henry.",
      "Sargassum on the other hand, she grimaces, is something \u201cwe will never run out of\u201d.",
      "\u201cTourism has suffered a lot from the seaweed; hotels have been spending millions on tackling it. It\u2019s caused a crisis,\u201d Dr Henry, a renewable energy expert and UWI lecturer, continues.",
      "The idea that it could have a valuable purpose was suggested by one of her students, Brittney McKenzie, who had observed the volume of trucks being deployed to transport sargassum from Barbados\u2019 beaches.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d just spent three weeks researching sugarcane. But I looked at Brittney\u2019s face and she was so excited, I couldn\u2019t break her heart,\u201d Dr Henry recalls.",
      "\u201cWe already had rum distillery waste water so we decided to put that with sargassum and see what happened.\u201d",
      "Brittney was tasked with collecting seaweed from beaches and setting up small scale bioreactors to conduct preliminary research.",
      "\u201cWithin just two weeks we got pretty good results,\u201d Brittney tells the BBC. \u201cIt was turning into something even bigger than we initially thought.\u201d",
      "The team filed a patent on their formula and, in 2019, presented their project to potential investors during a side meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York.",
      "Upon touchdown back in Barbados, Dr Henry\u2019s phone was \u201cbuzzing\u201d with messages of congratulation \u2013 including one from US non-profit Blue Chip Foundation offering $100,000 to get the work off the ground.",
      "Biologist Shamika Spencer was hired to experiment with differing amounts of sargassum and waste water to figure out which combination produced the most biogas.",
      "She says she leapt at the chance to take part.",
      "\u201cSargassum has been plaguing the region for several years,\u201d Ms Spencer, who is from Antigua and Barbuda, explains. \u201cI had always wondered about this new seaweed ruining the beaches in Antigua, and when I came to Barbados to study I noticed it here too.\u201d",
      "The algae do not just threaten tourism. They also pose a threat to human health through the hydrogen sulphide they release as they decomposes, along with native wildlife like critically endangered sea turtle hatchlings which get trapped in thick mats of beached seaweed.",
      "Water pollution and warming seas are credited with the upsurge in sargassum, another cataclysmic result of climate change that the Caribbean has done little to contribute to but often bears the brunt of.",
      "Calls for eco reparations from leaders including Barbados' leader Mia Mottley and Antigua\u2019s Prime Minister Gaston Browne have been clamorous in recent years as the region battles ever-rising sea levels and worsening storms.",
      "While waiting for those to bear fruit, this project represents one example of the Caribbean taking its environmental future into its own hands.",
      "\u201cI realised it was important that after removing the sargassum from beaches, it doesn\u2019t just go to landfills,\u201d Ms Spencer continues.",
      "\u201cBy repurposing it in vehicles you protect tourism and prevent people from inhaling it. When we scale up to fuel more vehicles it will require a very large volume.\u201d",
      "Watching the successful test drive of a biogas-charged Nissan Leaf \u2013 supplied by the Caribbean Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \u2013 was utterly exhilarating, smiles Dr Henry.",
      "The MIT-educated mechanical engineer knew she was risking her reputation should the venture fail.",

      "Both are originally from leading oil producer Trinidad, studied in the US and were determined to bring their skills back home.",
      "\u201cMy goal is to help build up this region,\u201d Dr Henry says. \u201cWe are now setting up a four-car pilot to demonstrate real life working prototypes to convince funders that this is workable and scalable.\u201d",
      "She estimates it will cost around $2m to display initial commercial activity and $7.5m to reach the point where the company is able to sell gas to 300 taxis in Barbados.",
      "Potential funders include the US Agency for Internationals Development, the European Union and international development banks through debt financing.",
      "The team plans to expand its work by setting up a biogas station to replace its small existing facility.",

    "story": [
      "Rapper Drake's company Frozen Moments filed a petition in a New York court Monday accusing the streaming service Spotify and Universal Music Group of conspiring to inflate the streams of Kendrick Lamar's hit diss track \"Not Like Us.\"",
      "\"Not Like Us,\" the result of Lamar and Drake's weekslong beef, broke records on the Billboard rap charts, retaining the top spot all summer. Frozen Moments, described in the filing as \"an entity wholly owned by Drake,\" alleges that UMG \"launched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves\" with \"Not Like Us\" via bots and pay-for-play agreements.",
      "The filing alleges the song was licensed to Spotify at a 30% discount in exchange for a boost in recommendations to users \u2014 the track now has over 900 million streams on Spotify, according to the service. The petition also alleges UMG used bots to drive up the streams on \"Not Like Us,\" paid radio promoters to increase air play and even paid tech giant Apple to have its voice assistant Siri misdirect users to Lamar's hit song.",
      "UMG called the allegations, \"offensive and untrue.\"",
      "\"We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns,\" UMG said in a statement. \"No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\"",
      "UMG owns both Interscope, Lamar's label and Republic Records, where Drake has spent his entire career. Drake has mentioned UMG CEO Lucian Grainge in lyrics multiple times over the years, including 2023's \"Away From Home\" \u2014   rapping \"Who the CEO of Universal?

      "NORTHFIELD, Minn. \u2014 \"The Oregon Trail,\" one of the most successful computer games of all time and a staple for children of the '80s and '90s,\u00a0is currently being developed into a movie project.",
      "Bill Heinemann says it's hard to find someone these days who hasn't heard of \"The Oregon Trail.\" The computer game he co-created in 1971 at Carleton College in Northfield has sold tens of millions of copies and is in the World Video Game Hall of Fame.",
      "\"It's surprising and gratifying and humbling, in a way, that a little thing that I spent two weeks on has become a worldwide phenomenon,\" Heinemann said.",
      "The idea sprouted when Heinemann's friend, Don Rawitsch, came up with a board game for students he was teaching that simulated 1800s settlers going west on the Oregon Trail.",
      "Computers were in their very early days, and even though Heinemann says he'd only seen \"Pac-Man,\" he sensed an opportunity.",
      "\"I said, 'That'll be a great application for a computer,' because you wouldn't have to shake the dice to see what happens,\" Heinemann said. \"What happens could come up and be unexpected.\"",
      "The game's become known for the many ways players can die, including by dysentery, but Heinemann's favorite was death by snake bite.",
      "\"It only happened once every several hundred times, and so people could've played it for months and all of a sudden, 'What? I got bit by a snake and died? This has never happened to me before!'\" he said.",
      "Now more than 50 years after the first \"Oregon Trail\" program, Apple is reportedly developing the game into an action-comedy movie.",
      "\"Surprising to me how popular it's become and how long the interest in it has been around,\" Heinemann said. \"And this is just the next step I guess.\"",
      "He won't be making any money off the movie. In fact, Heinemann's never seen a dime from the iconic game.",
      "He and his two co-creators, Rawitsch and Paul Dillenberger, turned it over to the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium shortly after they invented it.",
      "Heinemann says it doesn't bother him.",
      "\"I didn't do it for money,\" he said. \"I did it for just the love of the game and the love of teaching.\"",

    "story": [
      "Chuck Woolery, the affable, smooth-talking game show host of \"Wheel of Fortune,\" \"Love Connection\" and \"Scrabble\" who later became a right-wing podcaster, skewering liberals and accusing the government of lying about COVID-19, has died. He was 83.",
      "Mark Young, Woolery's podcast co-host and friend, said in an email early Sunday that Woolery died at his home in Texas with his wife, Kristen, present. \"Chuck was a dear friend and brother and a tremendous man of faith, life will not be the same without him,\" Young wrote.",
      "Woolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
      "In 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV's \"Love Connection,\" for which he coined the phrase, \"We'll be back in two minutes and two seconds,\" a two-fingered signature dubbed the \"2 and 2.\" In 1984, he hosted TV's \"Scrabble,\" simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.",
      "\"Love Connection,\" which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.",
      "A couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest's choice, \"Love Connection\" would offer to pay for a second date.",
      "Woolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. \"She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, 'I remember wagon trains.' The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.\"",
      "Other career highlights included hosting the shows \"Lingo,\" \"Greed\" and \"The Chuck Woolery Show,\" as well as hosting the short-lived syndicated revival of \"The Dating Game\" from 1998 to 2000 and an ill-fated 1991 talk show. In 1992, he played himself in two episodes of TV's \"Melrose Place.\"",
      "Woolery became the subject of the Game Show Network's first attempt at a reality show, \"Chuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,\" which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.",
      "Woolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, \"Wheel of Fortune\" debuted on Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.",
      "\"Wheel of Fortune\" started life as \"Shopper's Bazaar,\" incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" singing \"Delta Dawn,\" Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.",
      "\"I had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,\" Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. \"After the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, 'Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn't care what you have to say \u2014 that's the guy I want to be.'\"",
      "NBC initially passed, but they retooled it as \"Wheel of Fortune\" and got the green light. After a few years, Woolery demanded a raise to $500,000 a year, or what host Peter Marshall was making on \"Hollywood Squares.\" Griffin balked and replaced Woolery with weather reporter Pat Sajak.",
      "\"Both Chuck and Susie did a fine job, and 'Wheel' did well enough on NBC, although it never approached the kind of ratings success that 'Jeopardy!' achieved in its heyday,\" Griffin said in \"Merv: Making the Good Life Last,\" an autobiography from the 2000s co-written by David Bender. Woolery earned an Emmy nod as host.",
      "Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Woolery served in the U.S. Navy before attending college. He played double bass in a folk trio, then formed the psychedelic rock duo The Avant-Garde in 1967 while working as a truck driver to support himself as a musician.",
      "The Avant-Garde, which toured in a refitted Cadillac hearse, had the Top 40 hit \"Naturally Stoned,\" with Woolery singing, \"When I put my mind on you alone/I can get a good sensation/Feel like I'm naturally stoned.\"",
      "After The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single \"I've Been Wrong\" in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, \"Forgive My Heart\" and \"Love Me, Love Me.\"",
      "Woolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette. On Wynette's 1971 album \"We Sure Can Love Each Other,\" Woolery wrote \"The Joys of Being a Woman\" with lyrics including \"See our baby on the swing/Hear her laugh, hear her scream.\"",
      "After his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn't revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.",
      "He teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast \"Blunt Force Truth\" and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don't need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.",
      "\"President Obama's popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,\" he said.",
      "Woolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as \"Impeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.\"",
      "During the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump's chances for reelection to the presidency.",
      "\"The most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it's all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I'm sick of it,\" Woolery wrote in July 2020.",
      "Trump retweeted that post to his 83 million followers. By the end of the month, nearly 4.5 million Americans had been infected with COVID-19 and more than 150,000 had died.",
      "Just days later, Woolery changed his stance, announcing his son had contracted COVID-19. \"To further clarify and add perspective, COVID-19 is real and it is here. My son tested positive for the virus, and I feel for of those suffering and especially for those who have lost loved ones,\" Woolery posted before his account was deleted.",
      "Woolery later explained on his podcast that he never called COVID-19 \"a hoax\" or said \"it's not real,\" just that \"we've been lied to.\" Woolery also said it was \"an honor to have your president retweet what your thoughts are and think it's important enough to do that.\"",
      "In addition to his wife, Woolery is survived by his sons Michael and Sean and his daughter Melissa, Young said.",

    "summary": "Barbara Taylor Bradford\u200b was one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers, her net worth estimated at more than $200 million.",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Taylor Bradford, a British journalist who became a publishing sensation in her 40s with the saga \"A Woman of Substance\" and wrote more than a dozen other novels that sold tens of millions of copies, has died. She was 91.",
      "Bradford died Sunday at her home in New York City, a spokesperson said Monday. An obituary\u00a0was also posted to her website.",
      "Starting with \"A Woman of Substance,\" published in 1979, Bradford averaged nearly a book a year as one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers, her net worth estimated at more than $200 million and her fame so high that her image appeared on a postage stamp in 1999. In 2007, Queen Elizabeth II awarded her an OBE (The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire).",
      "Her books were published in 40 languages and sold more than 90 million copies around the world.",
      "With titles like \"Breaking the Rules\" and \"Act of Will,\" she specialized in stories of women fighting for love and power in a man's world. Her favorite among her books was \"The Women In His Life,\" inspired by her husband's escape from the Nazis.",
      "Bradford was married for 56 years to German-born film producer Robert Bradford, who died in 2019.",
      "A native of Leeds, West Yorkshire, she was an only child in a working class family who loved books early. As a girl, she had a story published in a local magazine. By age 16, she left school against her parents' wishes to become a reporter for the Yorkshire Evening Post. Over the next 30 years, she would work as fashion editor of Woman's Own Magazine, cover a variety of beats for the London Evening News and, in the United States, write a syndicated column about interior design.",
      "Although she wrote children's stories and advice books, novels were her dream. \"A Woman of Substance\" was a multi-generational chronicle of the travails and triumphs of retail baron Emma Harte, who would be featured in several other Bradford novels. The book has sold more than 30 million copies and was the basis of a 1984 television miniseries starring Jenny Seagrove as a young Emma and Deborah Kerr as Emma late in life.",
      "\"And if you want to meet the real Emma, meet me,\" Bradford told the Telegraph of London in 2009. \"Emma had to be tough and ruthless at times: but then so am I. I have to be, as a businesswoman. And I'm a bloody good businesswoman.\"",
      "Bradford and Emma Harte were linked by more than money: both had family secrets. As a young woman, Emma became pregnant by a man who refused to marry her and gave birth to a daughter. Years later, Bradford learned through her biographer that her own mother had been born out of wedlock. It is now believed that Bradford's maternal grandfather was Frederick Oliver Robinson, the second Marquess of Ripon and owner of the Studley Royal estate in Yorkshire, which is now a World Heritage Site.",
      "Seagrove, who became friends with Bradford after starring in the miniseries, described her as a \"powerhouse of glamour and warmth\" and a \"force of nature\" who stayed true to her roots.",
      "\"Success never diluted her warmth and humor or her ability to relate to everyone she met, whether a cleaner or a princess,\" Seagrove said. \"She never, ever forgot that she was just a girl from Yorkshire that worked hard and made good. RIP dear friend.\"",
      "Bradford had a strict writing routine: at work behind her IBM Lexmark typewriter by 6 a.m., break around 1 p.m., then back to writing until 6 p.m., at the latest. According to an authorized 2006 biography, Piers Dudgeon's \"The Woman of Substance,\" Bradford more than adapted to her midlife fortune, living in a 5,300 square foot apartment overlooking Manhattan's East River, collecting Impressionist art and enjoying refills of pink champagne poured by her Moroccan butler. When the Bradfords put their apartment up for sale in 2010, the asking price was just under $19 million. (They sold it to Uma Thurman in 2013 for $10 million).",
      "Over the years, she met many other celebrities. Bradford befriended Sean Connery before he appeared in his first James Bond movie and remembered advising him, thankfully in vain, that he should lose his Scottish accent if he wanted to succeed.",
      "Around the same time, she met a fellow journalist at the Yorkshire Evening Post. He was \"lanky and disheveled with acne,\" and kept trying to talk to her even after she turned him down for a date at the movies.",
      "He was Peter O'Toole.",
      "\"Years later, (Evening Post editor) Keith Waterhouse and I were at an event where the producer Sam Spiegel introduced the star of his new movie,\" she told The Guardian in 2021. \"Out walked the most beautiful man I'd ever seen, dressed as Lawrence of Arabia. Keith said: 'Don't you wish you'd gone to the pictures with him now?' I never got over Peter's transformation.\"",
      "According to the obituary on her website, when Bradford was recently asked what would be on her epitaph, she replied: \"She made her dreams come true.\"",
      "According to the obituary, Bradford will be laid to rest alongside her husband at Westchester Hills Cemetery, New York following a private funeral at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue.",

    "summary": "Every week on his blog, \"Sandwiches of History,\" Barry Enderwick rescues sandwich recipes from the dustbin of history. He's now collected some of the unlikeliest (and even amazing) historical recipes in a cookbook.",
    "story": [
      "Barry Enderwick is eating his way through history, one sandwich at a time. Every day from his home in San Jose, California, Enderwick posts a cooking video from a recipe that time forgot. From the 1905 British book \"Salads, Sandwiches and Savouries,\" Enderwick prepared the New York Sandwich.",
      "The recipe called for 24 oysters, minced and mixed with mayonnaise, seasoned with lemon juice and pepper, and spread over buttered day-old French bread.",
      "Rescuing recipes from the dustbin of history doesn't always lead to culinary success. Sampling his New York Sandwich, Enderwick decried it as \"a textural wasteland. No, thank you.\"\u00a0 Into the trash bin it went!",
      "But Enderwick's efforts have yielded his own cookbook, a collection of some of the strangest \u2013 and sometimes unexpectedly delicious \u2013 historical recipes you've never heard of.",
      "He even has a traveling stage show: \"Sandwiches of History Live.\"",
      "From the condiments to the sliced bread, this former Netflix executive has become something of a sandwich celebrity. \"You can put just about anything in-between two slices of bread,\" he said. \"And it's portable! In general, a sandwich is pretty easy fare. And so, they just have universal appeal.\"",
      "Though the sandwich gets its name famously from the Fourth Earl of Sandwich, the earliest sandwich Enderwick has eaten dates from 200 B.C.E. China, a seared beef sandwich called Rou Jia Mo.",
      "He declared it delicious. \"Between the onions, and all those spices and the soy sauce \u2026 oh my God! Oh man, this is so good!\"",
      "While Elvis was famous for his peanut butter and banana concoction, Enderwick says there's another celebrity who should be more famous for his sandwich: Gene Kelly, who he says had \"the greatest man sandwich in the world, which was basically mashed potatoes on bread. And it was delicious.\"",
      "Whether it's a peanut and sardine sandwich (from \"Blondie's Cook Book\" from 1947), or the parmesian radish sandwich (from 1909's \"The Up-To-Date Sandwich Book\"), Enderwick tries to get a taste of who we were \u2013 good or gross \u2013 one recipe at a time.",
      "RECIPE:\u00a0A sophisticated club sandwichBlogger Barry Enderwick, of Sandwiches of History, offers \"Sunday Morning\" viewers a 1958 recipe for a club sandwich that, he says, shouldn't work, but actually does, really well!",

    "story": [
      "Alice Brock, whose Massachusetts-based eatery helped inspire Arlo Guthrie's deadpan Thanksgiving standard, \"Alice's Restaurant Massacree,\" has died at age 83.",
      "Guthrie announced the death on the Facebook page of his own Rising Son Records label.",
      "\"This coming Thanksgiving will be the first without her,\" Guthrie wrote. \"Alice and I spoke by phone a couple of weeks ago, and she sounded like her old self. We joked around and had a couple of good laughs even though we knew we'd never have another chance to talk together.\"",
      "Guthrie wrote that she died in Provincetown, Massachusetts, her residence for some 40 years, and referred to her being in failing health. He did not say what was the cause of death.",
      "Born Alice May Pelkey in New York City, Brock was a lifelong rebel who was a member of Students for a Democratic Society, among other organizations. In the early 1960s, she dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College, moved to Greenwich Village and married Ray Brock, a woodworker who encouraged her to leave New York and resettle in Massachusetts.",
      "Guthrie, son of the celebrated folk musician Woody Guthrie, first met Brock around 1962 when he was attending the Stockbridge School in Massachusetts and she was the librarian. They became friends and stayed in touch after he left school, when he would stay with her and her husband at the converted Stockbridge church that became the Brocks' main residence.",
      "On Thanksgiving Day, 1965, a simple chore led to Guthrie's arrest, his eventual avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War and a song that has endured as a protest classic and holiday favorite. Guthrie and his friend Richard Robbins were helping the Brocks throw out trash, but ended up tossing it down a hill because they couldn't find an open dumpster. Police charged them with illegal dumping, briefly jailed them and fined them $50, a seemingly minor offense with major repercussions.",
      "By 1966, Alice Brock was running The Back Room restaurant in Stockbridge, Guthrie was a rising star and his breakout song was an 18-minute talking blues that recounted his arrest and how it made him ineligible for the draft. The chorus was a tribute to Alice \u2014whose restaurant, Guthrie pointed out, was not actually called Alice's Restaurant\u2014 that countless fans have since memorized:",
      "\"You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / Walk right in it's around the back / Just a half a mile from the railroad track / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.\"",
      "Guthrie assumed his song was too long to catch on commercially, but it soon became a radio perennial and part of popular culture. \"Alice's Restaurant\" was the title of his million-selling debut album, and the basis of a movie and cookbook of the same name.",
      "Alice Brock would write a memoir, \"My Life as a Restaurant,\" and collaborate with Guthrie on a children's book, \"Mooses Come Walking.\" At the time of her death, they had been discussing an exhibit dedicated to her at her former Stockton home, now the Guthrie Center, which serves free dinners every Thanksgiving.",
      "Brock ran three different restaurants at various times, although she would later acknowledge she initially didn't care much for cooking or for business. She would also cite her professional life as a cause of her marriage breaking up, while disputing rumors that she had been unfaithful to her husband.",
      "Her honor was immortalized by Guthrie, who late in \"Alice's Restaurant\" advised: \"You can get anything you want\" at Alice's Restaurant, \"excepting Alice.\"",

      "\"Well, since 'Gladiator' one, I made 17 big movies. I was quite busy,\" Scott said.",
      "But he admitted, \"During that time, I kept thinking, well, we should be doing 'Gladiator II.'\"",
      "A new hero in the arena",
      "Scott brings a fresh take on the same empire fans loved in the first movie.",
      "In the original film, Russell Crowe played Maximus, a general-turned-gladiator battling for honor. This time, the spotlight is on Irish actor Paul Mescal, who stars as a slave fighting for his freedom in the same empire.",
      "Scott, who studied art before becoming a filmmaker, started crafting the sequel's storyboards before the script was even complete.",
      "\"I'm already thinking \u2026 images. I'm drawing as [the writer] is writing. So when I enter on the set, I've already pre-planned everything,\" Scott said. \"It's very efficient because we did 'Gladiator' in 51 days.\"",
      "The sequel opens with an ambitious attack scene involving three full-scale Roman ships.",
      "\"I'm going to make three full-scale real ships,\" Scott said, explaining how they were mounted on massive industrial movers. \"Each trolley is about 100 feet long.\"",
      "While Scott embraces old-school filmmaking, he's also excited about modern tools like CGI.",
      "While Gladiator II features thrilling battles, Scott says the film also explores timeless themes and reflects on the constants of human nature, cruelty and violence.",
      "\"It reminds you that Rome would have Christians walked into that arena and eaten alive. Men, women, and children\u2014for fun,\" he said. \"What on earth was in the minds of Romans in that particular point? And have we come very far away from that? It's extraordinary that's still happening. We don't learn by history.\"",
      "The challenge of a sequel",
      "At 86, Scott admitted it was daunting to follow up on his original masterpiece. \"In a funny kind of way, I feel like I'm in a sport. It is competitive,\" he said. \"You're fighting yourself and your own fear and your own insecurity.\"",
      "When asked about his favorite part of the movie, Scott said, \"I think I'm relieved it is so embraced. And so I'm the favorite as the whole movie. It's pretty good.\"",

      "After years of personal struggles, Grammy winner Shelby Lynne thought her recording career may be over.",
      "But with the help of some friends, the singer-songwriter released her new album, \"Consequences of the Crown,\" earlier this year, which is her 17th studio album.",
      "Lynne's breakout album \"I am Shelby Lynne\" came after a difficult decision to leave Nashville 25 years ago.",
      "Personal struggles",
      "Lynne, now 56, was 19 when she signed a record deal in Nashville. Her first single was a duet with George Jones.",
      "Despite that early success, Lynne's private life was weighed down by a secret and family tragedy. Coming up in Nashville in the late 1980s, Lynne had to hide the fact that she was gay. She also kept her family history in the shadows. In 1986, she lost both her parents when her father shot and killed her mother and then turned the gun on himself.",
      "The only constant and way to cope for Lynne was music.",
      "\"I think that's why I would turn mean as hell \u2026 just protect, protect, protect. I didn't know what trauma was, or PTSD. I just knew I had to sing,\" Lynne said.",
      "Frustrated with Nashville, Lynne moved to California and changed genres. It worked. In 2000, she made the album that still defines her. \"I Am Shelby Lynne,\" widely considered a soul-pop masterpiece, helped her win a Grammy for best new artist.",
      "Lynne says music \"saved me a hundred times,\" but she struggled with commercial success, sobriety and the legacy of her parents.",
      "\"I mean, now I'm at peace with it, because I love them and it allows me to miss them,\" she said. \"It took me just like a gong in the head going, you know, they did the best they could. They did.\"",
      "Return to Nashville",
      "When Lynne left Nashville, she wasn't planning on coming back. However, after years of living in California, she quietly returned to the South in 2018.",
      "\"To be quite honest, I didn't know if Nashville was mad at me,\" she said.",
      "It's in Nashville where Lynne confronted sobriety and accepted help from friends, something she has never found easy to do.",
      "\"I still got the devil in me, but people like Ashley [Monroe] and Karen [Fairchild] and Gena [Johnson] saved me. They saw me when I was here at my worst and I was really just trying to start over,\" she said.",
      "Songwriters Karen Fairchild of \"Little Big Town\" and Ashley Monroe started writing with Lynne upon her return.",
      "It was Fairchild and Monroe that pushed Lynne to make new music.",
      "\"We kept kind of bugging her about it,\" Fairchild said.",
      "\"'We want a Shelby record,'\" Monroe remembered telling Lynne. \"She's like, 'Nobody wants that.' We do.\"",
      "That persistence paid off.",
      "\"I was so nervous because, I mean, I've held her at the very top of all my lists,\" Monroe said.",
      "Their respect was also matched by their intimidation of working with one of their idols.",
      "\"It's like everybody has this reverence for her,\" Fairchild said of Lynne. \"And also like, there's fear\u2026 because she's a force.\"",
      "Fairchild and Monroe met with Lynne at the studio of engineer Gena Johnson to help create the album. Though hesitant about making new music, with a little help from her friends, Lynne eventually saw it all taking shape.",

    "summary": "When it comes to eating healthy, all of us respond to foods differently. The National Institutes of Health's new nutrition study hopes to finally provide Americans a personalized answer to the question: \"What should I eat?\"",
    "story": [
      "It's been said the best meals come from the heart, not from a recipe book. But at this USDA kitchen, there's no pinch of this, dash of that, no dollops or smidgens of anything. Here, nutritionists in white coats painstakingly measure every single ingredient, down to the tenth of a gram.",
      "Sheryn Stover is expected to eat every crumb of her pizza; any tiny morsels she does miss go back to the kitchen, where they're scrutinized like evidence of some dietary crime.",
      "Stover (or participant #8180, as she's known) is one of some 10,000 volunteers enrolled in a $170 million nutrition study run by the National Institutes of Health. \"At 78, not many people get to do studies that are going to affect a great amount of people, and I thought this was a great opportunity to do that,\" she said.",
      "It's called the Nutrition for Precision Health Study. \"When I tell people about the study, the reaction usually is, 'Oh, that's so cool, can I do it?'\" said coordinator Holly Nicastro.",
      "She explained just what \"precise\" precisely means: \"Precision nutrition means tailoring nutrition or dietary guidance to the individual.\"",
      "The government has long offered guidelines to help us eat better. In the 1940s we had the \"Basic 7.\" In the '50s, the \"Basic 4.\" We've had the \"Food Wheel,\" the \"Food Pyramid,\" and currently, \"My Plate.\"",
      "They're all well-intentioned, except they're all based on averages \u2013 what works best for most people, most of the time. But according to Nicastro, there is no one best way to eat. \"We know from virtually every nutrition study ever conducted, we have inner individual variability,\" she said. \"That means we have some people that are going to respond, and some people that aren't. There's no one-size-fits-all.\"",
      "The study's participants, like Stover, are all being drawn from another NIH study program called All Of Us, a massive undertaking to create a database of at least a million people who are volunteering everything from their electronic health records to their DNA. \u00a0It was from that All of Us research that Stover discovered she has the gene that makes some foods taste bitter, which could explain why she ate more of one kind of food than another.",
      "Professor Sai Das, who oversees the study at Tufts University, says the goal of precision nutrition is to drill down even deeper into those individual differences. \"We're moving away from just saying everybody go do this, to being able to say, 'Okay, if you have X, Y and Z characteristics, then you're more likely to respond to a diet, and somebody else that has A, B and C characteristics will be responding to the diet differently,'\" Das said.",
      "It's a big commitment for Stover, who is one of 150 people being paid to live at a handful of test sites around the country for six weeks \u2013 two weeks at a time. It's so precise she can't even go for a walk without a dietary chaperone. \"Well, you could stop and buy candy \u2026 God forbid, you can't do that!\" she laughed.",
      "While she's here, everything from her resting metabolic rate, her body fat percentage, her bone mineral content, even the microbes in her gut (digested by a machine that essentially is a smart toilet paper reading device) are being analyzed for how hers may differ from someone else's.",
      "Nicastro said, \"We really think that what's going on in your poop is going to tell us a lot of information about your health and how you respond to food.\"",
      "Stover says she doesn't mind, except for the odd sounds the machine makes. While she is a live-in participant, thousands of others are participating from their homes, where electronic wearables track all kinds of health data, including special glasses that record everything they eat, activated when someone starts chewing. Artificial intelligence can then be used to determine not only which foods the person is eating, but how many calories are consumed.",
      "This study is expected to be wrapped up by 2027, and because of it, we may indeed know not only to eat more fruits and vegetables, but what combination of foods is really best for us. \u00a0The question that even Holly Nicastro can't answer is, will we listen? \"You can lead a horse to water; you can't make them drink,\" she said. \"We can tailor the interventions all day. But one hypothesis I have is that if the guidance is tailored to the individual, it's going to make that individual more likely to follow it, because this is for me, this was designed for me.\"",

    "summary": "Kennedy's team is weighing a significant rewrite of the FDA's rules.",
    "story": [
      "Advisers to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are weighing a significant rewrite to the Food and Drug Administration's rules governing food additives, to fulfill Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump's \"Make America Healthy Again\" pledge to get toxic chemicals out of the food supply.",
      "The proposed crackdown, which is still in its early stages and will need to get a sign-off from Trump and his transition team, targets a provision in the FDA's regulations on which food additives are considered by the agency to be \"generally recognized as safe,\" or GRAS.",
      "Advisers to Kennedy, Trump's pick for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, have also floated other approaches to curbing the use of food additives, including working with agricultural producers to change the subsidies and incentives offered by the government for certain kinds of foods Kennedy argues are unhealthy.",
      "\"I think the overall posture of the FDA should be actually a lot of deregulation. I think we should have a golden age of innovation and drug development. Nobody's standing in the way of that,\" Calley Means, a top adviser to Kennedy's transition team, said this month on \"The Liz Wheeler Show.\"",
      "Means said \"corrupt regulatory interpretations\" had broken the regulation of additives under the GRAS process, saying it had become a \"totally rigged system.\"",
      "\"But when it comes to food, when it comes to 'generally recognized as safe,' complete self-policing from this industry, allowing them to put chemicals in our food that are banned in every other country and have hundreds of studies saying are harmful, there needs to be a review,\" Means said.",
      "\"This is a bananas system\"",
      "Advocacy groups and experts have long denounced the FDA's \"loophole\" in its regulation of these food additives, which allows companies to quietly decide which chemicals they deem safe enough to add to their products without going through the agency's oversight.",
      "\"This is a bananas system. This is not the way that new food chemicals should be approved and come into our food supply,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.",
      "While companies with new chemicals can choose to go through a \"voluntary\" process to earn a spot on the agency's list of substances that are \"generally recognized as safe,\" making it easier to market foods with the additives, officials acknowledge companies often bypass it.",
      "\"It does undermine the overall credibility of the system when it is possible to get a chemical on the market without prior review by the FDA,\" the agency's top food official, Jim Jones, said at an event hosted by the Alliance for a Stronger FDA earlier this year.",
      "Bill Freese, science director for the Center for Food Safety, cited times companies have decided to go ahead and \"self-certify\" that their food additives were safe, even after failing to earn the sign-off of the FDA's reviewers during the voluntary process.",
      "That has strayed far from the original intent of the provision, Freese said, which was supposed to narrowly \"grandfather in\" foods with a long history of safe use like salt and vinegar.",
      "\"These GRAS exemptions should be limited. The FDA just expanded the loophole until it just literally swallowed the entire statute,\" he said.",
      "Obstacles in Congress and the courts",
      "Making it mandatory for companies to go through the GRAS notification process before using any new food ingredients will likely face hurdles.",
      "Cracking down on food additives would dramatically broaden the FDA's workload. The agency would have to both screen new notifications as well as look back at previously greenlighted chemicals.",
      "FDA officials have long called for Congress to step up funding for oversight of food additives, warning that resources were stretched thin even with the current duties.",
      "One idea to broaden FDA's funding \u2014 attaching fees to applications submitted by food manufacturers, similar to the \"user fees\" programs for medical products \u2014 has also failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill. Kennedy has also been critical of the \"user fees\" approach for drugs, and has called to undo it.",
      "Another obstacle could come through the courts, especially in light of a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that curtailed agency power.",
      "Advocacy groups lost a previous federal lawsuit against the FDA trying to require the notifications back in 2021. In that case, the judge found that \"it remains unclear under the statute whether FDA even has the authority to make GRAS notifications mandatory.\"",
      "\"I think there are certainly things within FDA's power to narrow the loophole, to make it harder for companies to take advantage of the GRAS process. But there is some legal precedence saying that this is Congress' problem to fix, so we'll just have to see,\" said Benesh.",
      "While Kennedy's team acknowledges the issue may end up needing to be hashed out through legislation on Capitol Hill, changing the procedure solely through the executive branch is on the table, an adviser said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said he is asking Trump to \"declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease\" as another way to supercharge his authorities amid blowback they expect from the food industry.",
      "\"This is not a monolithic, this is not an all-powerful industry. They can be disrupted. So that's what gives me hope. The voters and President Trump's microphone are on our side,\" Means said.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, an industry trade group representing several large food companies Kennedy has criticized like cereal maker WK Kellogg and soft drink company Coca Cola, said in a statement that keeping consumers \"safe is our number one priority.\"",
      "\"The federal regulatory agencies within HHS operate under a science and risk-based mandate and it is critical that framework remains under the new administration,\" Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of federal affairs for the association, said in a statement.",
      "Gallo has\u00a0previously said the food industry would be open to the FDA taking a more proactive role, in hopes of negating \"the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures that have stepped in to ban some additives.",
      "\"As the largest domestic manufacturing employer, supporting more than 22 million American jobs, we are prepared to work with the confirmed appointee and qualified experts within HHS to support public health, build consumer trust and promote consumer choice,\" Gallo said.",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft is investigating an issue with its Microsoft 365 service and its Teams app, with some users reporting to\u00a0DownDetector that they are having problems using services such as Exchange and Outlook.",
      "On social media service X, Microsoft posted a message\u00a0early Monday that it is assessing \"an issue impacting users attempting to access Exchange Online or functionality within Microsoft Teams calendar.\" The problem appears to be affecting Microsoft users globally, according to posts from users.",
      "\"We've identified a recent change which we believe has resulted in impact. We've started to revert the change and are investigating what additional actions are required to mitigate the issue,\" Microsoft added in a subsequent post.",
      "Microsoft 365 is a subscription-based app that packages services like Word and Excel, while also providing cloud-based storage, while Teams is primarily used by workplaces for video calls and online chat. Although DownDetector, an online service that tracks tech outages, only had a few dozen reports of problems with 365 as of early Monday morning, users posted on social media that they were experiencing issues with the Microsoft services.",
      "University of Galway \"is aware of an issue impacting some Microsoft 365 services, including Outlook, Outlook Calendars, Teams etc,\" noted the Irish university's IT group on X. \"This is an intermittent issue impacting Microsoft 365 customers globally. Microsoft is aware & investigating.\"",
      "When did the outage begin?",
      "Reports of outages began at about 4 a.m. Eastern Time, according to DownDetector. By 10 a.m., there were about 2,000 reports from people saying they were having problems with Microsoft 365, the outage detection service said.",
      "That rose to as many as 5,000 reports by noon Eastern Time, before complaints on DownDetector began to ebb in the late afternoon. However, Microsoft users were still posting about errors and problems connecting to the company's services on Monday afternoon.",
      "\"Unfortunately, this is our primary tool for doing business so everything is on hold for us until it's fixed,\" one user wrote on X at about 1 p.m. Eastern.",
      "Monday's problems with Microsoft 365 comes after a massive outage in July, when banks, airlines, health systems and other industries that rely on the service were hit by a technical problem caused by global cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.",
      "The disruption, which led to thousands of flights and train services being canceled globally, spawned a number lawsuits, with Delta Air Lines suing\u00a0CrowdStrike and Microsoft over the outage, which took down the airline's internal systems and caused\u00a0chaos\u00a0for travelers.",
      "Is Outlook down?",
      "Some users reported problems with Microsoft Outlook, including trouble connecting to the service as well as sending emails, according to DownDetector.",
      "\"Outlook 365 is really spotty this morning. Experiencing intermittent email outages,\" one user wrote on DownDetector.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can help you research travel destinations as well as simplify tasks like making reservations. But can AI also plan a trip or vacation better than you can?",
      "To put AI to the test, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave used\u00a0Google's Gemini bot\u00a0to explore travel options, while CBS News correspondent Nancy Chen, herself a seasoned traveler, relied on more conventional online tools to compare deals across flights, hotels and activities. Here's what they found.",
      "Which approach saved time and money?",
      "For the sake of comparison, both Van Cleave and Chen set out to travel to Las Vegas, Nevada, but they went about planning the trip in different ways.",
      "Using Google's Gemini AI app, Van Cleave spent under a minute on his mobile phone to generate a potential itinerary. For her part, Chen spent about 45 minutes comparing deals and reviews across websites including Expedia, Kayak and Tripadvisor.",
      "The upshot? He saved time, while the total cost of a flight and three nights at a five-star hotel came out to $741.48, compared to $780.05 for the same itinerary rustled up by Chen.",
      "\"I think he won this round, and I really need a vacation now,\" Chen said.",
      "Communication breakdown",
      "Yet while Gemini found some savings, it fell short once the pair was on the ground, and Van Cleave tasked it with creating an itinerary of free activities and events.",
      "\"I am on my way, letting AI guide my day,\" Van Cleave said. The technology directed him to visit the Bellagio Resort & Casino, where it suggested he visit a free botanical garden. But that information appeared to be outdated.",
      "\"What it didn't tell me \u2014 they seasonally tear it down for a holiday display,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Chen, guided by her own internet research, visited the Pinball Hall of Fame, which was open and which displayed hundreds of pinball machines, including vintage games from 1953.",
      "AI also fell short for Van Cleave when it told him that morning fountain shows at the Bellagio are less crowded than those that take place in the afternoon.",
      "\"The reason the morning fountain shows are less crowded is because there are no morning fountain shows,\" Van Cleave said. \"They don't start until three.\"",
      "Van Cleave was misdirected yet again when he arrived at what he expected to be the Mirage, a casino resort, for a volcano show. In its place was a construction site where a new Hard Rock Cafe has yet to open.",
      "More successfully, AI steered Van Cleave to Vegas' art district on Fremont Street, and booked a dinner reservation that was to the correspondents' liking.",
      "To err is human",
      "Not that Chen's search was foolproof. She visited the Stratosphere Tower, the tallest observation tower in the U.S., in hopes of scoring a free ride to its top floor drinks lounge. There was just one hitch.",
      "\"I thought it would be free to go up to the drinks lounge...but turns out it charged admission as well,\" she said.",
      "In the end \u2014 and recognizing the unscientific nature of CBS News' experiment \u2014 AI was a clear winner on speed. But it still appears to require human surveillance to ensure its recommendations are up to date and accurate.",
      "One AI travel tool company, GuideGeek, told CBS News it is 98% accurate, but that it is continually upgrading the tech to better advise users on attractions' business hours and other information. Users are also instructed to give the AI feedback when it provides a faulty recommendation in order to improve the product for other travelers.",
      "Indeed, major travel service providers seem confident that \"generative AI,\" which functions by creating text, videos and other content based on existing data, is here to stay. Expedia, just to name one major travel site, has also launched its own AI travel tool, to provide customers with a range of information, such as the best time to visit certain destinations.",
      "Kris Van Cleave and \n                                                  \n                                  Nancy Chen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent as his pick for U.S. Treasury secretary, choosing a former executive with Soros Fund Management who in recent years has been a vocal supporter of the former president's policies, from tariffs to spending cuts.",

      "Bessent, who had provided economic advice to the Trump campaign, has had a decades-long career in finance. He analyzed macroeconomic and geopolitical risks while working at the Soros Fund, where he served as chief investment officer, as well as at other hedge funds.",
      "Perhaps more importantly in helping him gain Trump's backing, Bessent countered other economic experts during the presidential campaign, arguing that they were wrong about the impact of the former president's policies. In a recent Fox News opinion piece, he asserted that tariffs aren't inflationary, rejecting the views of 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists that Trump's plans to impose broad tariffs could reignite price increases.",
      "\"Critics of tariffs argue that they will increase the prices Americans pay for imported goods,\" Bessent wrote for Fox News. \"But the facts argue against this. President Trump's first-term tariffs did not raise the prices of the affected goods, despite predictions back then that the tariffs would prove inflationary.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Scott Bessent.",
      "What is Bessent's educational and work history?",
      "Bessent, a Yale graduate, initially sought to become a journalist, but when he didn't get the post as editor of the Yale Daily News, he changed direction. Bessent secured an internship with money manager Jim Rogers, George Soros' first partner and co-founder of the Quantum Fund, he told his university's alumni magazine.",
      "\"And he even offered \u2014 which was key for me \u2014 a place to stay on the office sofa,\" Bessent told the publication.",
      "Bessent is the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of New York-based hedge fund\u00a0 Key Square Capital Management, according to S&P Capital IQ. He has also taught at Yale University, offering classes on economic booms and busts in the 20th century and the history of hedge funds.",
      "What are Bessent's political and economic views?",
      "In an October opinion piece in The Economist, Bessent singled out globalization as sparking growing inequality in the U.S., which has led to widening social and economic disparities.",
      "\"Western middle- and working-class populations are growing increasingly wary of globalization,\" he wrote. \"The only way to preserve the benefits of the international trading system is to question some of its mistaken assumptions and update them for the current moment.\"",
      "Among those updates: tariffs, with Bessent arguing in his Fox News piece that taxes on goods imported into the U.S. can \"increase revenue to the Treasury, encourage businesses to restore production and reduce our reliance on industrial production from strategic rivals.\"",
      "Bessent has advised Trump to create a \"3-3-3\" policy, which includes cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, as well as pushing GDP growth to 3% via deregulation and pumping out an extra 3 million barrels of oil each day, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "What about Bessent's ties with Soros?",
      "The relationship between a one-time Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a Republican leader like Trump may seem unusual, given that the billionaire philanthropist is viewed negatively by many conservatives.",
      "But Trump views Bessent's experience working for Soros as a positive, according to the Journal, which noted that the former president is impressed with the legendary investor's wealth.",
      "While at Soros Fund Management, Bessent bet against the yen, generating almost $1 billion over a three-month period, the Journal noted.",

      "He filed a workers' compensation claim for his injuries, and was instructed by doctors not to push, pull or lift anything over 10 pounds, as well as to stop driving a commercial vehicle. Walmart failed to accommodate these work restrictions, the lawsuit alleges.",

      "It's part of an effort to keep consumers chomping on burgers as some Americans lose their taste for fast-food amid rising prices even at what are usually reliably cheap dining alternatives.",
      "The McValue platform will be available in restaurants nationwide beginning Jan. 7, the company said. It will include McDonald's $5 meal deal, which the company launched in June. That offering includes either a McDouble burger of McChicken sandwich, four chicken McNuggets, a small order of fries and a small soft drink.",
      "In addition, the new McValue platform will introduce exclusive offers through its mobile app, and local food and drink deals. A new buy one, add one for $1 is also part of the offering. It applies to popular breakfast, lunch and dinner items like breakfast sandwiches, nuggets and burgers. When costumers buy one full-priced item from the McValue menu, they may add an additional item for just $1.",
      "\"When it comes to value, we know there's no one-size-fits-all. We've worked closely with our franchisees to create a new platform that will let our customers define value on their own terms,\" Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA said in a statement. \"From deals on their personal go-to order to universal favorites like the $5 Meal Deal, we're excited to give fans more ways to save every time they visit one of our restaurants.\"",

    "summary": "Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza \u2014 also known as bird flu \u2014 is killing layer hens and reducing the nation's egg supply.",
    "story": [
      "Americans planning to do some holiday baking this year may have to scramble to track down a key ingredient.",
      "Some stores around the U.S. are running short of eggs, especially those operating in states that require eggs from cage-free hens, as cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) flare and the virus spreads from wild birds to commercial flocks. More than 40% of the nation's roughly 300 million egg-laying hens are raised in cage-free facilities, but roughly 60% of \"bird flu\" cases recently detected involved cage-free farms.",
      "\"After two months of no outbreaks, we had them recently in Utah, Oregon, California and Washington, and three of those states are exclusively cage-free,\" Emily Metz, chief executive and president of the American Egg Board, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Where we are hearing reports of shortages it's at stores like a Whole Foods or a Trader Joe's.\"",
      "After a brief respite from bird flu among commercial-egg producers, HPAI struck again starting in mid-October, resulting in the loss of 2.8 million birds. The nation's egg production fell 2.6% last month from a year ago and is projected to be down 1% this year versus 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service recently said in a monthly\u00a0report.",
      "The outbreaks, which began in January of 2022, have affected nearly 110 million chickens, turkeys and other birds, including wild, commercial and backyard flocks in 49 states, according\u00a0to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the first time HPAI, also known as H5N1,\u00a0had been detected in the U.S. since 2016.",
      "The return of bird flu is wiping out poultry populations at commercial facilities in multiple states, most recently striking more than a million egg-laying hens in California's Kern County, where HPAI had been confirmed in 2.2 million egg-laying hens the prior week, according\u00a0to\u00a0the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "More than 790,000 egg layers were also culled last week at a commercial operation in Arizona's Pinal County.",
      "How long do shortages last?",
      "The tighter egg supplies means the U.S. is experiencing \"hyper-localized shortages that are very temporary and intermittent and that are corrected sometimes within a day,\" said Metz, whose board markets and promotes eggs and egg products.",
      "\"There are local areas where supplies aren't quite as strong, so you might see pockets where shelves get picked over,\" said Brent Nelson, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "After HPAI-related shortages drove up egg prices in the spring, the virus is having the same impact this winter. Experts forecast that egg prices could stay elevated for the rest of the year and into 2025.",
      "As with the cost of other commodities, egg prices fluctuate with supply and demand, the latter of which has remained fairly stable over the year, regardless of cost, according to the Farm Bureau's Nelson. The egg board, however, said America's appetite for the protein has grown of late, rising steadily for 20 consecutive quarters.",
      "\"We see egg prices ride the wave as bird flu comes and goes,\" Nelson said. Right now, \"Bird flu infections are by far the biggest factor impacting egg prices.\"",
      "The national average for a dozen eggs is $3.37, up 30% from a year ago but lower than the January 2023 average of $4.82, the economist said. But some regions are seeing even higher prices. In California, white cage-free eggs were selling for about $5.26 a dozen last week \u2014 up nearly 90% from $2.81 during the same time in 2023, according to the USDA.",
      "Despite the price spikes, Nelson and Metz advised consumers against hoarding a perishable product like eggs, emphasizing that shortages typically pass quickly as retailers replenish their supplies.",
      "\"Eggs keep in the fridge really well \u2014 if you need them, go and get them,\" said Nelson.",
      "Added Metz, \"There is a hen for almost every person in the U.S., if they are not in the supermarket today, come back tomorrow.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:39:26 -0500",
    "summary": "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday said it will consider the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund, agreeing to review a lower court decision that upended the mechanism for funding programs that provide communications services to rural areas, low-income communities and schools, libraries and hospitals.",
      "The dispute is the latest in which the high court will consider the power of federal agencies. Among the issues in the case is whether Congress delegated too much authority to the FCC when it tasked the agency with determining how much telecommunications providers must contribute to the Universal Service Fund. The court also asked the lawyers involved in the case to argue whether it is moot because the challengers did not seek preliminary relief before the lower court.",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority has in a string of recent decisions taken aim at federal regulatory power amid efforts by the conservative legal movement to rein in the so-called administrative state. In a major ruling in June, the court overruled a 40-year-old decision that said courts should give agencies leeway in interpreting ambiguous laws passed by Congress if their interpretation is reasonable.",
      "Arguments in this dispute will likely take place early next year, with a decision expected by the end of June.",
      "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996 as part of an overhaul of the Communications Act of 1934, which sought to promote competition and get rid of monopolies in the telecommunications industry. Under the revamped law, the FCC created a set of programs supported by the Universal Service Fund that require contributions from telecommunications providers.",
      "Those programs ensure schools, libraries, rural health care facilities and rural and low-income customers have access to telecommunications services, and the FCC uses the money in the fund to subsidize the provision of telephone and broadband services.",
      "Quarterly contributions to the fund are based on projected expenses the programs will incur, as well as projected revenue from telecommunications carriers, a number that is known as the contribution factor. Companies may pass the cost of their contributions on to consumers.",
      "In 1997, the FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company, a private, not-for-profit corporation that administers the fund. The company sends out bills and collects contributions from service providers, and disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "In late 2021, the company proposed each carrier would contribute to the fund 25.2% of its interstate and international telecommunications revenue for the first quarter of November 2022. But a nonprofit called Consumers' Research, telecommunications company, and group of consumers filed a comment challenging the contribution mechanism, arguing Congress had unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to the FCC, which in turn redelegated power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. They then sought review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges rejected the group's claim that Congress and then the FCC had unconstitutionally delegated their authority.",
      "But the full complement of judges on the 5th Circuit agreed to rehear the case and in a July decision, sided with the challengers in a 9-7 vote. It found that when carriers seek reimbursements of their fund contributions from consumers, they are levying a \"universal service\" tax on consumers that appears on their phone bills.",
      "The power to tax is a legislative power, and the 5th Circuit's majority found that Congress gave the FCC too much discretion in determining the amount of universal service contributions. It also ruled that the FCC, in turn, \"may have impermissibly delegated the taxing power to private entities.\"",
      "\"American telecommunications consumers are subject to a multi-billion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of that tax is de facto determined by a trade group staffed by industry insiders with no semblance of accountability to the public. And the trade group in turn relies on projections made by its private, for-profit constituent companies, all of which stand to profit from every single tax increase,\" the 5th Circuit found, adding the \"combination of delegations, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends\" the Constitution.",
      "The 5th Circuit's decision set off a wave of pushback from the telecommunications industry, which warned it would hamper efforts to close the digital divide.",
      "A group of telecommunications trade groups said the ruling \"could put at risk the availability and affordability of essential communications services for millions of rural Americans, low-income consumers, and community anchor institutions.\"",
      "Before the 5th Circuit ruled, the Supreme Court turned down two appeals from Consumers' Research of decisions from the 6th and 11th Circuits that rejected its challenges to the Universal Service Fund. But following the 5th Circuit's decision, the group urged the Supreme Court to reconsider its appeals. The court has not acted on those requests.",

    "story": [
      "It's well-documented that women in the workplace often face biases when seeking leadership roles, but new research is uncovering just how pervasive and wide-ranging those prejudices can be.",
      "In the working world, women leaders report experiencing 30 types of identity factors that discriminate on everything from their body size to marital status, according to new\u00a0research from Wilson College chief information officer Amy Diehl, Westmont College dean Leanne Dzubinski and Clarkson University professor Amber Stephenson published in the peer-reviewed Human Resource Development Quarterly.",
      "The findings stem from the trio's 2023 research into age discrimination. That work, published in the Harvard Business Review, found that women in the workplace\u00a0face bias\u00a0regardless of their age, with their superiors often viewing them as too inexperienced if they are young and too unworthy of promotion if they are older. The new study surveyed more than 900 women in leadership roles in four industries where women comprise a large share of the workforce \u2014 health care, higher education, law and faith-based nonprofits.",
      "\"Surprised and shocked\"",
      "\"The way we phrased the question was, 'Tell us about any other identity factors that are impacting your experience'\" in the workforce, Diehl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We thought there would be age and race. We were surprised and shocked when we looked through the data and came up with 30.\"",
      "It's telling that the factors focus on personal qualities like class, marital status and sexual orientation, rather than professional qualifications or skills, underscoring that these biases aren't relevant to whether a woman can perform in the workplace, the researchers said.",
      "\"There is always an excuse masquerading as a reason given for a women about why she's not quite right for any role,\" noted Dzubinski.",

      "Stumbling on the broken rung",
      "While the new research focuses on women in their 40s and 50s who have already reached leadership roles, younger women are more likely to be held back by the so-called broken rung, or when women fail to get a promotion out of entry-level jobs at the same rate as men, research from consulting firm McKinsey and LeanIn, the nonprofit started by former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, has found.",
      "Their research found bias may play a role in stunting women's careers, with young men often promoted on their potential while young women are judged more on their track records.",
      "The new research on bias encountered by women in leadership roles didn't examine how women coped with bias as they climbed the professional ladder, although Diehl noted that women who rise into senior positions tend to \"have a thick skin,\" and might use techniques such as diverting conversations away from identity issues when they arise.",
      "Bias from other women",
      "The researchers focused on four industries where workers are either split equally between men and women or are female-dominated, although the top leadership positions in all these fields are typically held by men. The goal, in short, was also to examine the impact of gender bias in industries not dominated by men.",
      "The women leaders who responded to the survey were college presidents, vice presidents and provosts within higher education; physicians and physician administrators in health care; lawyers and partners within the legal field; and women who hold top leadership roles in faith-based nonprofits.",
      "\"If you have women well represented in the industry, we're still seeing that women are still experiencing various types of bias,\" Stephenson said. \"It's a very real and very embedded situation within any workplace\" regardless of gender composition.",
      "Dzubinski added, \"It used to be the argument that as soon as you get more women in, it would fix itself \u2014 it's not fixing itself.\"",
      "Women can internalize bias and express it against other women in their workplace, while some might believe that there's not enough room at the top for more than a few women, the researchers noted. That can lead to the belief the only way to ascend into leadership roles is if another woman loses her spot, they said.",
      "Can you combat workplace bias?",
      "It's difficult for women to fight such biases, given that others may judge women negatively regardless of their situation, such as whether they are married or unmarried, both of which can trigger prejudices, the research noted.",
      "\"Notice that they are contradictions \u2014 if you are married, that's a problem, or if you aren't married that's a problem,\" Dzubinski told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you put them together you see that they are made up excuses\" to justify why women don't deserve promotions.",
      "While difficult, women should try not to take identity-based criticism personally, Diehl said.",
      "\"It feels very much, 'It's about me,' but it really isn't. It's about larger, systematic gender bias that's trying to force them out of the workplace or into supporting roles, and not leadership roles,\" she said.",
      "Organizations can deal with some of these issues by going over their practices and checking whether these identity factors are playing a role in whether people receive or are denied promotions, the researchers said. Another tool is to use a \"flip it\" strategy, applying the same statement about a woman to a man, such as \"John can't take on this role because he just had a child',\" they noted.",
      "With an onling push against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (DEI) from conservative lawmakers, some companies are dropping their investment in DEI. That could pick up speed under President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he'll do more to remove these policies in his next term, while Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's handbook for the next conservative White House, proposes removing all federal rules and programs around DEI.",
      "But rooting out bias can help organizations perform better, the researchers noted.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed Facebook's appeal of a lower court order reviving a shareholder lawsuit brought against the social media giant in light of consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's 2015 misuse of millions of Facebook users' data.",
      "In its first opinion of the term, the high court issued a one-line unsigned decision dismissing Facebook's appeal. The court's ruling indicates it believes it should not have taken up the case, though the Supreme Court did not explain its reasoning.",
      "In tossing the appeal, the Supreme Court leaves in place a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in favor of Facebook shareholders. They had filed a securities fraud lawsuit against Facebook for allegedly misleading them in financial filings about the risks stemming from the massive data breach by Cambridge Analytica.",
      "The case involved what information publicly traded companies must disclose in the \"risk factors\" section of their annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and specifically, whether they're obligated to share risks that materialized in the past, even if those events don't present ongoing or future business harm.",
      "The dispute stems from a class action lawsuit that arose out of the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook user data in 2015. Cambridge Analytica had purchased data collected through a personality quiz on Facebook and used it to create psychological profiles of U.S. voters to assist GOP Sen. Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "While Cambridge Analytica said in the wake of the scandal that it deleted the data from Facebook, it was reported in 2018 that the firm had lied. Instead, it kept the information and used it to help then-candidate Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.",
      "Facebook's stock price was not impacted after Cambridge Analytica's misuse of user data was revealed in 2015. But it plummeted in early 2018 after the consulting firm's ongoing misuse of Facebook data for the Trump campaign came to light.",
      "A group of investors who bought Facebook stock between February 2017 and July 2018 swiftly sued the tech giant in federal court, alleging the company's statements in the risk factors section of its 2016 10-K filing were misleading.",
      "In its filing, Facebook warned that \"security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\" The investors alleged the statements were inaccurate because they framed the risk of data misuse by third parties as hypothetical \u2014 even though Cambridge Analytica had improperly used data from Facebook members.",
      "A federal district court dismissed the claims, finding in part that the challenged statements weren't false because \"the Cambridge Analytica scandal was [not] harming Facebook's reputation, business or competitive position\" when the company filed its 2016 risk disclosure.",
      "But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled for the shareholders and allowed their case to proceed, finding they adequately alleged Facebook's risk disclosures were misleading because the company \"represented the risk of improper access to or disclosure of Facebook user data as purely hypothetical when that risk had already transpired.\"",
      "Facebook then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing in part that the 9th Circuit's decision imposes \"expansive risk-disclosure requirements that will force public companies to inform investors of past incidents that pose no known threat to the business.\"",
      "The company also noted that there is a split among the federal courts of appeals as to what companies have to disclose on their SEC filings. One, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, doesn't require firms to disclose any past events in their risk factors, while other appeals courts require such disclosures only if the company knows the prior events will harm their business.",
      "Facebook said that the 9th Circuit's rule would open the door to lawsuits alleging \"fraud-by-hindsight\" and make risk disclosures burdensome to companies and less useful to investors as they seek to avoid liability.",
      "The Biden administration backed the shareholders in the case, arguing that \"it is plainly misleading to characterize an adverse event that has already materialized as a merely hypothetical future risk.\"",

      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

    "title": "Trump's proposed tariffs could raise U.S. grocery prices, analysis finds",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 18:09:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could raise costs for U.S. consumers, economists say. Here's how much grocery bills could rise.",
    "story": [
      "Americans say they continue to feel the aftereffects of the highest inflation in four decades, especially at the grocery store, where prices remain 26% higher than before the pandemic. President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could cause even more financial strain in the nation's food aisles by reigniting price hikes, according to a recent study.",
      "Although it remains to be seen what he does as president, ahead of the Nov. 5 election Trump proposed a 10% tariff on all U.S. imports, as well as a 60% tariff on products from China. Manufacturers and retailers typically pass on at least some of those costs to customers.",
      "As a result, hefty new tariffs could cause prices for a range of consumer goods, from everyday items such as groceries to less frequent purchases like furniture, to rise, according to the\u00a0analysis\u00a0from Third Way, a left-leaning think tank. Trump's tariffs could cause a typical family's annual grocery budget in 2025 to swell by almost $200 next year, which would amount to an increase of more than 3%, according to Third Way.",
      "\"Prices are absolutely going to rise, because the added costs from increased tariffs will be paid by the consumer,\" Gabe Horwitz, senior vice president for the economic program at Third Way, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those price increases are going to be a lot harder for folks lower down on the income scale.\"",
      "Third Way has been supportive of President Joe Biden's economic policies and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the election.",
      "Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, who is set to be his White House Press secretary, \u00a0disputed the claim that President-elect Trump's policies will boost inflation.",
      "\"In his first term, President Trump instituted tariffs against China that created jobs, spurred investment and resulted in no inflation. President Trump will work quickly to fix and restore an economy that puts American workers by re-shoring American jobs, lowering inflation, raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations and unshackling American energy,\" she said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "To be sure, the timing and magnitude of any new tariffs imposed once Trump takes office is unclear. Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool for negotiating leverage in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "Tariffs are considered a regressive form of taxation, meaning they hit the lowest-income consumers the hardest. That's because low-income families spend a larger share of their budgets on essentials like groceries, versus higher-income earners.",
      "Horwitz and a team of economists put together an approximation of what an average family of four might buy each week at the supermarket, noting that there can be a lot of variation from one family to another. Researchers\u00a0 compared current average prices of\u00a0 groceries with their potential costs if Trump follows through with his proposal for adding tariffs to all imports.",
      "\"We wanted to look specifically at what the tariffs could mean for family budgets,\" Horwitz said.",
      "How much more could groceries cost?",
      "Researchers assumed a weekly trip to the grocery store would include buying coffee, beer, shrimp, beef, bananas, avocados, jam and olive oil.",
      "While these might not be typical purchases for all families, researchers focused on regularly consumed goods for which the U.S. relies heavily on imports, or does not produce domestically at all.",
      "Trump's tariffs would likely cause families to spend at least $3.57 more on such groceries each week, adding up to an additional $185 per year, or an increase of 3.3%, according to the Third Way analysis. The price hikes would apply to each of the eight items on the sample grocery list.",
      "Big-box store prices",
      "Consumers could also end up paying more for items bought less frequently at big-box retail stores like Walmart and Target, Third Way found.",
      "One U.S. company is already responding to the proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden says it plans to import fewer goods made in China to the U.S., and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "\"We have been planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly,\" CEO Edward Rosenfeld told analysts on a recent earnings call. \"We've worked hard over a multiyear period to develop our factory base and our sourcing capability in alternative countries, like Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, etc.\"",
      "Families could end up paying an additional $551 per year at big-box stores, with their spending rising 14% from $3,754 to $4,305, according to Third Way's research.",
      "Big-box store purchases would rise more dramatically in cost because more goods sold at these types of stores are imported from China.",
      "\"If you take Trump at his word, the sheer cost of tariffs for low-income families is astronomical,\" Horwitz said.",
      "Imposing steep new tariffs on other countries could raise economic costs in another way \u2014 by inviting tit-for-tat levies on U.S. exports. Oxford Economics on Thursday forecast that the Trump administration would impose blanket tariffs of 30% on all Chinese imports and that Beijing would retaliate.",
      "\"Tariffs are a two-way street, and the more aggressive tariffs on China will lead to a larger retaliation,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"We assume China will impose 25% tariffs on all U.S. exports, though with exemptions for electronic products.\"",
      "Oxford also expects the U.S. to hit Japan with 10% on metals and cars, leading to reciprocal tariffs on the same U.S. exports.",

    "story": [
      "Bitcoin topped $98,000 for the first time Thursday, extending a streak of almost daily all-time highs since the U.S. presidential election. The cryptocurrency has rocketed more than 40% in just two weeks.",

      "Yet cryptocurrency markets remain a wild place and what comes next is impossible to know. And while some are bullish, other experts are warning of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \"digital alternative\" to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "Trump's election win boosts crypto",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. election.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who was once critical of digital currencies,\u00a0pledged during his campaign\u00a0against Vice President Kamala Harris to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to create a bitcoin \"strategic reserve.\" His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "Spot bitcoin ETFs",
      "Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Bitcoin volatility",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. Experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "How bitcoin mining works",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \"mining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth's Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin's electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:07:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy say the Department of Government Efficiency has targets in mind for cost cutting.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are sharing details about how their newly created Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which isn't an official government department \u2014 plans to take aim at paring federal spending, with the two writing in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Wednesday that they are aiming to cut $500 billion in annual spending.",
      "The announcement of DOGE has raised a host of questions, from whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal spending, typically controlled by Congress, as well as the group's powers and how it will operate. Musk and Ramaswamy provided answers to some of those questions in their opinion piece, arguing that President-elect Donald Trump has the authority to cut spending authorized by Congress.",
      "While Musk and Ramaswamy said they \"expect to prevail\" in cutting costs, there have been plenty of examples throughout the decades of efforts aimed at reining in federal spending, which have had only limited results. For instance, President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s tapped businessman J. Peter Grace to recommend reforms, resulting in about 2,500 recommendations for cutting spending, most of which were never implemented.",
      "Musk has suggested slicing $2 trillion in annual federal spending, an amount experts say is unrealistic given that most of the nation's $6.7 trillion in yearly outlays is spent on Social Security, Medicare and the military.",
      "But in the Wednesday opinion piece, Musk and Ramaswamy wrote that their initial aim will be to cut \"the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Where will Musk's DOGE aim to cut federal spending?",
      "Two-thirds of federal spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "But as mentioned above, Musk and Ramaswamy said they'll target $500 billion in spending that is unauthorized by Congress, as well as programs they believe aren't in line with lawmakers' intentions.",
      "The biggest source of expired authorizations sits with health care for veterans, which cost $119 billion in fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "However, Musk and Ramaswamy didn't single out veterans' health care as a place where they'd seek to cut. Instead, they listed the following areas:",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives $535 million a year\u00a0International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grantsPlanned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",

      "International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grants",
      "Planned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",
      "Which federal programs don't have authorization?",
      "The programs mentioned by Musk and Ramaswamy are relatively tiny compared with other areas that are unauthorized, such as veterans' health care.",
      "The next biggest sources of expired authorizations, after veterans' health care, include programs that invest in opioid treatment, the State Department and housing assistance. Some smaller programs with expired funding include Head Start, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. The latter provides weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring, among other tasks.",
      "According to Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that was developed by the Heritage Foundation to guide the next conservative White House, the NOAA \"should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated.\"",
      "DOGE wants to cut federal workers. Here's how.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy also underscored that they'll push to cut the ranks of federal employees, saying their efforts could lead to \"mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.\" The pair didn't enumerate the number of workers they'll seek to push out of the federal workforce.",
      "In 2023, there were more than 2 million federal employees, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group focused on the federal government. Most of those workers are within Veterans Affairs, due to a large number of health care providers for the VA, followed by people enlisted in the armed services, its data shows.",
      "While civil service workers have job protections, Musk and Ramaswamy argued that the president would be legally allowed to enact \"reductions in force\" that don't target specific workers, as well as to make decisions including \"large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area.\"",
      "The DOGE would help federal employees \"transition into the private sector,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote. \"The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit.\"",
      "The pair also said they want to require federal workers to be in the office five days a week, a policy change that they predict would \"result in a wave of voluntary terminations.\"",
      "In a Thursday post on X, the social media service owned by Elon Musk, the DOGE wrote, \"Federal government agencies are using, on average, just 12% of the space in their DC headquarters.  The Department of Agriculture, with space for more than 7,400 people, averaged 456 workers each day (6% occupancy).\"",
      "It added, \"Why are American taxpayer dollars being spent to maintain empty buildings?\"",
      "How much do federal workers earn?",
      "Pay varies by department and seniority, with the federal government publishing a General Schedule of basic pay grades for most federal employees. For 2024, the lowest pay grade was about $22,000 in annual earnings, while the highest was about $160,000. Some agencies offer competitive salaries to compete with the private sector. Pay may also vary by location.",
      "Federal employees are located in every state, with 80% located outside the Washington, D.C. area, according to the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "Workers at the Administrative Conference of the United States, an independent federal agency charged with identifying improvements for federal agencies to protect public interests, have the highest median salary, at about $242,000, according to federal data.

    "title": "Are food recalls and outbreaks on the rise?",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 09:44:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA says America's food supply is still \"one of the safest in the world,\" despite some recent high-profile recalls and outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that the U.S. food supply is still \"one of the safest in the world,\" in the wake of a number of foodborne disease outbreaks affecting items ranging from organic carrots to deli meats to McDonald's Quarter Pounders. E. coli, listeria and other contaminants have sickened thousands of people and forced a number of recalls in recent months.",
      "But despite those high-profile examples, data cited by the FDA suggest recalls were not unusually high this past year.",
      "For the fiscal year that ended in September, there were 179 recalls deemed by the agency's food and cosmetics arm as being for the highest-risk classification of issues, like potential contamination with bacteria or undeclared allergens.",
      "That's up from 145 high-risk recalls in 2023, but less than the 185 the agency recorded in 2022. There were 167 high-risk recalls in 2019.",
      "This classification includes the recall of tens of thousands of cases of onions processed by Taylor Farms that were pulled earlier this fall, after officials suspected they were to blame for a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounder burgers that has sickened more than a hundred people.",
      "\"Our ultimate goal is for industry to do their part to ensure that the foods they introduce into the market are not adulterated or misbranded. Recalls help get the food off the market quickly when something goes wrong. Outbreak advisories provide important food safety information to the public,\" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson also pointed to The Economist's report measuring global food security. The U.S. food supply is \"one of the safest in the world\" and ranked \"joint first for the food safety indicator in 2022,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In fact, the FDA suggested, the number of recalls is an indicator that the safety system is working.",
      "\"The occurrence of recalls and outbreaks means that manufacturers, importers and distributors are monitoring for issues and taking action when they detect a problem,\" the FDA spokesperson said.",
      "An increase in illnesses in CDC data \u2014 but also an increase in testing",
      "Figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest the number of high-profile recalls have increased from last year, though not by much.",
      "So far this year, 10 \"multistate foodborne outbreak notices\" have been issued by the CDC. Last year there were nine notices. There were 24 notices issued in 2018, the most of any year over the past decade.",
      "Infections from foodborne outbreak culprits like Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, or STEC, have climbed to at least 13,962 this year, CDC records tally.",
      "Around 13,140 had been reported by health departments around this time last year and 12,119 were reported by this time in 2019.",
      "Foodborne illnesses linked to other germs have also climbed across the country in recent years, reports by the CDC's FoodNet system suggest, though improvements in how patients are tested for these germs may help explain some of the increase.",
      "\"Laboratory technology changes and that impacts what we see in the surveillance data. When laboratory testing gets faster, it gets more specific, it gets better in other ways. It makes the data a little bit less comparable,\" Sharon Shea, senior director of food safety at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told CBS News.",
      "Shea, who has also worked as a microbiologist in hospital laboratories as well as public health labs, said other ways that public health departments and doctors respond to foodborne outbreaks have gotten better as well.",
      "Some of that is a time-saving shift towards \"molecular-based\" panel tests that can be run by hospitals and clinical labs for an array of germs, instead of one-off tests for specific pathogens, that were rolled out after 2012.",
      "Labs in the PulseNet network helmed by the CDC have also switched to \"whole genome sequencing,\" Shea said \u2014 a more accurate approach to narrowing down the unique genetic fingerprint that can link different cases together for investigators. Those connections can be crucial for uncovering common foods eaten by sick people in an outbreak.",
      "\"The most preventable, needless deaths\"",
      "Food safety advocates outside the government say the U.S. still has plenty of room for improvement in food safety.",
      "\"It doesn't help to say 'Americans have the safest food in the world' when people are dying from baby carrots,\" said Sarah Sorscher, head of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Sorscher acknowledged that public health departments have gotten better at investigating outbreaks, but cautioned that still only a fraction of foodborne illnesses are solved.",
      "\"Our public health system is getting better at solving outbreaks thanks to advances in whole genome sequencing and artificial intelligence, so it may be that we are just seeing more of the iceberg now than we did a few years ago,\" she said.",
      "Staffing shortages and breakdowns in food safety had also led to an artificial dip in the number of recalls and reported illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sorscher said.",
      "\"Our food supply is not as safe as it was even five years ago. Anyone who's gone to the grocery store or rifled through their refrigerator to see which onions and carrots in the produce drawer are the subject of the latest recall knows that,\" said Scott Faber, senior vice president for government relations at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Faber pointed to a previous report tracking a rebound in food recalls after 2020, based on data from the FDA as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Inspections by the FDA of food facilities are falling short of a congressional mandate, the Environmental Working Group has argued. They have also criticized the agency for not requiring testing of irrigation water sprayed on crops, which can pose a contamination risk from nearby animal feeding operations.",
      "\"Not unlike washing your hands or not cutting your vegetables on the same cutting board as your chicken, they're just common sense measures to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. And these are the most preventable, needless deaths imaginable,\" said Faber.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:10:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Some voters are hoping President-elect Donald Trump may send out another stimulus check. Here's what the experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump in his first term as president sent out two stimulus checks to millions of Americans during the pandemic, part of the federal government's goal of keeping consumers financially afloat during the crisis. Now, some social media posts are claiming that Trump, once he takes office next year, may issue another check \u2014 a likelihood that experts say is extremely slim.",
      "Posts on TikTok are suggesting Trump might issue another round of checks, while on X, some users are questioning if they're in line for a payment.",
      "When the COVID-19 health emergency shuttered the economy in 2020, millions of Americans lost their jobs, sending the jobless rate to almost 15% and causing financial hardship for many. As a result, Trump signed two bills that sent stimulus checks to eligible households, while President Biden authorized a third.",
      "Even though many Americans feel the economy is faring badly, with some pointing to the impact of the pandemic's high inflation, the U.S. isn't anywhere close to the situation of the early 2020s, economists say.",
      "\"Stimulus checks typically only happen when the economy is in really bad shape and consumers need a push to start spending money again,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not really the case in the present.\"",
      "Is the economy bad enough for a new stimulus check?",
      "While a majority of Americans give the economy poor ratings, economists say that it's in good shape overall, with solid GDP growth, inflation that is inching closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal and a jobless rate of 4.1% \u2014 which is near a 50-year low.",
      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025. Instead, Trump and Republican lawmakers are likely to focus on tax legislation to extend the tax cuts in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as well as tackling other spending issues, experts say.",

    "story": [
      "Thanksgiving dinner ingredients will cost more this year compared with last, even as food inflation cools. Fortunately, there's one simple way to save money without skimping on staple dishes for the food-driven holiday: store brands.",
      "Buying store-brand items versus national brand products is an age-old technique for saving money. And although there are instances of store-brand goods costing more than their name-brand counterparts, they can still save consumers money overall, new research from Wells Fargo\u00a0shows.",
      "How much can I save on store brands?",
      "\"Food inflation has slowed dramatically, but it's still not cheaper than a year ago, so that's a bone of contention from consumers,\" Wells Fargo chief agricultural economist Dr. Michael Swanson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, grocery stores can undercut national brand prices by selling their own version of products from tissues to baked beans. Stores allege their products are equally good, but because they don't market them, they can sell them at a relative discount.",
      "\"The whole premise is that store brand represents a value to you. What store brand is supposed to bring is the same quality, same product, without all the marketing,\" Swanson said. \"Brands explain why you should eat theirs and not someone else's, whereas stores don't spend money and are supposed to pass the savings along to us, the consumers.\"",
      "This year, a store-brand Thanksgiving menu for 10 people, including turkey, stuffing, salad, cranberries, dinner rolls and pumpkin pie will cost consumers $73. That same menu made with name-brand products, will cost $90 this year, or $17 more, according to the Wells Fargo report.",
      "The $73 price tag is up 2.7% from last year.",
      "Keep your eye on all items \u2014 not just the turkey",
      "Grocers tend to run promotions on turkeys around Thanksgiving, given that they're such a seasonal purchase \u2014 the two-week window before the Thanksgiving holiday is when grocers make the bulk of their whole turkey sales.",
      "But buyers beware: Some retailers can lure you into the store with a deal on a turkey, only to sell you other items at high prices.",
      "\"Retailers will feature discounts on turkey to get you into store so that, while you're there, you'll pick up everything else,\" Swanson said. \"Make sure you don't just go in for the turkey and not pay attention to prices of other things on the shopping list, which can add up to a lot of money.\"",
      "Store-brand stuffing mixes are still priced high, but are an opportunity for savings nevertheless. Name-brand stuffing is up 9% compared with the same period last year, and store-brand stuffing is up 3%.",
      "Cranberries are an outlier this season. It's a category in which the name-brand product is priced lower than the store-brand alternative. A 12-ounce bag of name-brand fresh cranberries is down 3% compared with 2023, while the same-size bag of store-brand cranberries is up 6%.",

    "summary": "Republicans vying for jobs allege Trump transition aide Boris Epshteyn has been mixing private consulting with his transition role.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is grappling with internal strife over the alleged conduct of a senior and longtime adviser, Boris Epshteyn, who has been accused by at least one Republican politician of trying to profit personally from his ability to influence Trump's Cabinet picks.",
      "Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens submitted a sworn declaration to the transition team alleging that \"Mr. Epshteyn's overall tone and behavior gave me the impression of an implicit expectation to engage in business dealings with him before he would advocate for or suggest my appointment to the President.\"",
      "\"This created a sense of unease and pressure on my part,\" said the declaration, which was first obtained by the online publication Just the News and shared with CBS News. Greitens and his attorney, Timothy Parlatore, authenticated the one-page document to CBS News.",
      "Parlatore, who has been critical of Epshteyn in the past, confirmed to CBS News that the declaration was submitted in connection with an internal investigation that is being conducted by David Warrington, who served as general counsel to the Trump campaign. According to Parlatore, Warrington interviewed Greitens about his interaction with Epshteyn late last week and then asked Greitens to submit the declaration. Warrington has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"It was important to me to protect the president because I was concerned about the ethics of what was happening,\" Greitens told CBS News. \"Very specifically, I was concerned that there was an offer to advance a nomination in return for financial payments.\"",
      "Epshteyn told CBS News he is \"honored to work for President Trump and with his team.\"",
      "\"These fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from Making America Great Again,\" Epshteyn said in his statement.",
      "The Trump transition team confirmed it had conducted a review and now intended to move on from the issue,\u00a0as first reported by CNN. \"As is standard practice, a broad review of the campaign's consulting agreements has been conducted and completed, including as to Boris, among others,\" said transition spokesman Steven Cheung. \"We are now moving ahead together as a team to help President Trump Make America Great Again.\"",
      "Epshteyn has been a near-constant figure by Trump's side in recent years, buoying him on air and helping to coordinate his multiple legal teams behind closed doors. Those teams have had unquestionable success, impeding Trump's two federal criminal cases before they could get to trial, and stymying a state case against Trump in Georgia. Trump was convicted in the one case that went to trial, in New York, but recently the sentencing in that case was postponed indefinitely. On Monday, special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal district court to dismiss the charges against Trump stemming from an alleged scheme to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, and he also sought to end his bid to revive the case against Trump arising from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents.",
      "A native of Russia who emigrated to New Jersey with his family when he was 11, Epshteyn was brought into the Trump sphere by Georgetown University classmate Eric Trump. He started as a low-level staffer during Trump's first run for office and was able to parlay that into a junior position on the White House communications team. Two months later he abruptly resigned over circumstances that remain unclear, but by then he had managed to win over Trump as his loyal confidant and fixer.",
      "Eric Trump said Monday in a Fox News interview that \"I've known Boris for years, and I've never known him to be anything but a good human being.\" But he implied the allegations could have consequences for Epshteyn.",
      "\"I certainly hope the reporting is false and I can also tell you if it's true, you know, the person will probably no longer be around,\" Eric Trump said.",
      "Epshteyn supporters praise his ability to execute orders and resolve problems, which they attribute to a frenetic energy, his bulldog personality and a cunning understanding of the political dynamics of Trump's advisers. Epshteyn has become so close to Trump that the president-elect jokingly refers to Epshteyn as \"my psychiatrist,\" The New York Times first noted. According to multiple sources, Epshteyn's access to Trump is at times only rivaled by family members.",
      "In the weeks since Trump won his second term as president, Epshteyn has been a mainstay in discussions about filling out the Cabinet. The New York Times reported Epshteyn played a critical role in recommending former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general, a bid that ultimately failed to win favor and was withdrawn.",
      "The status of Epshteyn's consulting business while assisting in the transition is unclear. But prior to the 2024 election, the business appeared to be robust. A review of publicly available records indicate his firm has been paid more than $1 million from Trump's campaigns and aligned PACs since 2020, and another $1.2 million by other campaigns.",
      "While there is nothing new about political consultants \u2014 on both sides of the aisle \u2014 using their connections, interviews with about two dozen advisers, lawyers and allies of Trump reveal Epshteyn's political consulting work has bred both praise and resentment.",
      "CBS News spoke with more than half a dozen Republican candidates who have engaged with Epshteyn. Many described his pitch, offering an array of services, including \"strategic advice\" on messaging and boosting a candidate's social media presence. But nearly everyone interviewed said his access to Trump had allure.",
      "Ahead in the polls as his Republican Senate primary approached in 2022, Don Bolduc wanted to make sure Trump didn't play spoiler by endorsing one of his New Hampshire rivals. Bolduc said he turned to Epshteyn \"to run interference inside the Trump circle.\"",
      "A service like that doesn't come cheap. \"I thought $100,000 was a lot of money for what we were asking, but that's what was paid,\" said Bolduc, who added \"no guarantee\" was given by Epshteyn that Trump wouldn't endorse a rival.",
      "Bolduc won his primary after Trump stayed neutral. He told CBS News that while it appeared to him that he got what he paid for, the experience left him feeling disillusioned with the transactional side of elections. After the campaign ended in general election defeat, Bolduc said he chose to leave politics for good.",
      "\"There's nothing honorable about politics,\" said Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general. After his failed Senate race, Bolduc enrolled in a police academy and became a rookie small-town cop at age 60.",
      "After publication, Rick Wiley, a senior adviser on Bolduc's campaign, told CBS News that Epshteyn \"was retained by General Bolduc's campaign for strategic media consulting with conservative media outlets, and he delivered.\"",
      "Wiley listed three shows that Bolduc appeared on and said they enabled \"his campaign to reach supporters and voters throughout New Hampshire and across the country.\"",
      "Among those who hired Epshteyn for his campaign services in the past was Greitens, who served as Missouri governor during a portion of the first Trump term. In the weeks since Trump won reelection, Greitens said he contacted Epshteyn for assistance to be considered for an appointment as U.S. Navy secretary.",
      "\"During the conversation, despite the absence of an explicit offer, Mr. Epshteyn's comments and demeanor suggested that he might entertain offering a position in the administration in exchange for financial consideration, but such an offer would happen in a subsequent discussion,\" Greitens wrote. \"He stated that there would be 'time for that later' and that it was 'not time for that yet.'\"",
      "\"Mr. Epshteyn's overall tone and behavior gave me the impression of an implicit expectation to engage in business dealings with him before he would advocate for or suggest my appointment to the President,\" Greitens wrote. \"This created a sense of unease and pressure on my part.\"",

    "title": "Judge dismisses charges against Trump in D.C. election case after Smith request",
    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:55:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal judge to toss out the charges against President-elect Donald Trump in the case stemming from the 2020 election.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal judge overseeing the 2020 election case against former President Donald Trump agreed to dismiss the charges following a request from special counsel Jack Smith, bringing to a close the historic and unprecedented prosecution of the nation's 45th and 47th president.",
      "U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan granted Smith's request just hours after he said in a filing that he is seeking to close Trump's case because Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "\"After careful consideration, the department has determined that [the Office of Legal Counsel's] prior opinions concerning the Constitution's prohibition on federal indictment and prosecution of a sitting president apply to this situation and that as a result this prosecution must be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated,\" Smith wrote\u00a0in his filing. \"That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the government stands fully behind.\"",
      "The special counsel noted the historic nature of Trump's prosecution and subsequent election to the presidency, writing that the \"department and the country have never faced the circumstance here, where a federal indictment against a private citizen has been returned by a grand jury and a criminal prosecution is already underway when the defendant is elected president.\"",
      "But after consultation with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, the special counsel said \"the department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\"",
      "Smith said in his six-page motion that he conferred with Trump's lawyers, and they did not object to the request to drop the case. The special counse sought to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning prosecutors could decide to charge Trump again after he leaves office in January 2029.",
      "Chutkan said in a brief opinion that dismissing the case without prejudice is \"appropriate\" in part because it is \"consistent with the government's understanding that the immunity afforded to a sitting president is temporary, expiring when they leave office.\"",
      "In response to Smith's request to drop the charges, Steven Cheung, Trump's spokesman, said in a statement, \"The American people re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate to make America great again. Today's decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump and is a major victory for the rule of law. The American people and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.\"",
      "The judge's approval of Smith's request to dismiss the case and toss the four federal counts against the president-elect was expected. The special counsel is also likely to submit a final report to the attorney general and resign before Trump takes office. Smith's request was not a surprise, as he and the Justice Department were in talks about how to wind down the prosecution after Trump was elected to a second term earlier this month. The special counsel consulted with Attorney General Merrick Garland about the decision to drop the case.",
      "Smith was appointed special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 after Trump announced his third run for the White House. He took over two ongoing federal probes into Trump's conduct, one focused on his alleged mishandling of classified records and the other tied to the 2020 election.",
      "After a monthslong grand jury investigation, Smith obtained a four-count indictment against Trump that alleged he sought to resist the peaceful transfer of power following Joe Biden's electoral victory and allegedly engaged in a criminal scheme in the process. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and denied wrongdoing.",
      "The indictment laid out a sprawling scheme in which prosecutors accused Trump and his unnamed co-conspirators of working to undermine the legitimacy of the election results and halt the certification of the Electoral College votes in a bid to stay in power.",
      "Trump's legal team successfully delayed the case well into this year after they claimed Trump was immune from prosecution because he was president at the time the alleged conduct took place. Chutkan and a D.C. appeals court panel rejected the argument of presidential immunity. The case was put on hold as the Supreme Court then took up the matter.",
      "Ultimately, the high court issued a landmark decision in the case, ruling in July that presidents are immune from federal criminal prosecution for actions taken in their official capacity as president of the United States. The Supreme Court's 6-3 opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts allowed for charges to be filed when a president acted in an unofficial or personal capacity.",
      "Some of the alleged conduct included in Smith's 2023 indictment was disqualified from the case and the special counsel later secured a superseding indictment against Trump in an attempt to contour the charges to the Supreme Court's ruling. Trump pleaded not guilty to the new indictment earlier in September.",
      "Before Smith asked her to dismiss the case, Chutkan was in the midst of applying the Supreme Court's immunity decision to the case. In October, she made public a key filing from Smith that provided a comprehensive look at the evidence prosecutors amassed in their case against Trump. The special counsel and his team said that when he lost the 2020 race, Trump \"resorted to crimes\" to hold onto power.",
      "The filing described how Trump and his aides allegedly planned to challenge the results of the 2020 election well before Election Day and pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "In one striking passage, prosecutors said Trump replied, \"So what?\" when he was told that Pence could be in danger at the Capitol, where Congress had convened to tally state electoral votes. A mob of Trump's supporters breached the building, leading to the evacuation of Pence and lawmakers.",
      "The White House declined to comment on Smith's filing to dismiss the charges.",
      "\"I'd refer you to the Department of Justice, and I would just underline that the president is proud to have restored the independence of the Department of Justice when it comes to critical matters \u2014 criminal matters,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.",
      "The special counsel is expected to make a similar request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, where judges were considering whether Smith's other case against Trump \u2014 dealing with classified documents \u2014 should be revived after a Florida federal judge dismissed the case in July. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled Smith was unlawfully appointed to the role of special counsel by Garland and as a result, the case against Trump was invalid. The Justice Department appealed her ruling.",
      "In addition to the two federal cases, Trump was charged by local prosecutors in separate cases in Fulton County, Georgia, and New York City. The New York case stemmed from a hush-money payment made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels after the 2016 election, and a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies in May, making him the first former president convicted of a crime.",
      "He was set to be sentenced last month in New York, but it was delayed following the election. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him in the sprawling racketeering case in Fulton County, which is related to an alleged effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
      "Trump's bid for a second term loomed over his prosecutions, as it was widely expected his federal cases would be dropped if he succeeded in winning the White House.",
      "Now, with both of Smith's cases closer to being settled, he is likely to file a final report with the attorney general, as is required by special counsel regulations, and is expected to resign from his post before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20, 2025, two sources familiar with Smith's plans previously told CBS News. Garland pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed during his tenure \u2014 a commitment he has so far upheld \u2014 and he is likely to do so in the Smith cases, too. Prior special counsels have testified before Congress about their reports, and Smith could, as well.",
      "Should the public release of Smith's report stall for any reason and be delayed into the Trump administration, the odds of its disclosure become increasingly slim, since the president-elect has said he intends to nominate many of his top defense attorneys to leadership roles within the Justice Department.",
      "Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who defended Trump in the two federal cases and other matters in New York, are set to serve as deputy attorney general and principal associate deputy attorney general respectively, two powerful posts within the Justice Department. Trump has said he will nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi for the top job as attorney general.",
      "He has also selected D. John Sauer to serve as solicitor general, who represents the government before the Supreme Court. Sauer argued the immunity case on behalf of Trump in April.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0 Special counsel Jack Smith on Monday sought to end his bid to revive the case against President-elect Donald Trump arising from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents, which would bring to a close the historic and unprecedented case against the nation's 45th and 47th president.",
      "In a filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, Smith cited Trump's recent victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the November presidential election and referred to longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "The district court judge presiding over Trump's case, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, had ruled earlier this year that the charges should be dismissed because Smith was unlawfully appointed. The special counsel appealed the decision, but has now asked the 11th Circuit to dismiss his appeal.",
      "In his brief filing, Smith cited a separate request to dismiss his other case involving Trump, which involves an alleged scheme to overturn the 2020 election. The special counsel said in that filing submitted to a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that after consultation with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, \"the department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\"",

      "The federal judge overseeing the 2020 election case agreed to drop the charges against Trump just hours after Smith filed his request, marking the culmination of the monthslong prosecution against the president-elect. In the documents case, dismissing the appeal as to Trump would leave in place the lower court's order tossing out the charges against him. The appeal will continue as to Trump's two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, because unlike the president-elect, \"no principle of temporary immunity applies to them,\" Smith wrote.",
      "\"The special counsel's decision to proceed in this case even after dismissing it against President Trump is an unsurprising tribute to the poor judgment that led to the indictment against Mr. De Oliveira in the first place,\" John Irving, de Oliveira's lawyer, said in a statement. \"Just because you can doesn't mean you should. If they prefer a slow acquittal, that's fine with us.\"",
      "A lawyer for Nauta declined to comment.",
      "Trump became the first former president to face federal charges when a grand jury returned an indictment against him in June 2023. The prosecution came months after FBI agents conducted a court-authorized search of Trump's South Florida property, Mar-a-Lago, in August 2022 and recovered more than 100 documents marked classified that he kept after his first term ended in January 2021.",
      "Following the search, Trump mounted a separate legal battle that brought the appointment of an independent arbiter to sift through the material seized by the FBI, though the 11th Circuit ordered an end to that review in late 2022.",
      "Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November of that year to take over the federal investigation into Trump's handling of sensitive government records and pursued charges against the president-elect for unlawfully retaining national defense information and attempting to obstruct the Justice Department's probe. Trump was charged alongside two employees, Nauta, an aide, and de Oliveira, the property manager as Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Trump, Nauta and de Oliveira pleaded not guilty to all charges. The president-elect claimed his prosecution was a politically motivated attempt to harm his candidacy in the race for a second term.",
      "Prosecutors used court filings to reveal information about how Trump allegedly stored records containing the nation's secrets at his resort, as well as how he, with his co-defendants, allegedly engaged in a scheme to deceive federal investigators and stymie their probe.",
      "They included photos showing boxes of material stacked on the stage in Mar-a-Lago's ballroom and in a bathroom on the property. Other images taken by the FBI during its August 2022 search show boxes of records in a storage room and in Trump's office, some of which prosecutors said contained highly sensitive information alongside personal keepsakes and other items from his presidency.",
      "Cannon initially set a trial date for May 20, 2024, but she postponed the proceedings weeks before they were set to begin.",
      "The president-elect and his lawyers attempted to have the case against him dismissed on a variety of grounds, claiming he was selectively prosecuted, he was shielded from federal charges by presidential immunity and Smith was appointed in violation of the Constitution.",
      "Trump succeeded in persuading Cannon that the special counsel's appointment and funding for his office were unlawful, and she ordered the case to be dismissed in July.",
      "But Smith appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit. Both he and Trump's lawyers submitted filings with the court presenting their views on Cannon's ruling, though the court had not yet set a date for arguments. It was expected that an eventual decision from the 11th Circuit would wind up before the Supreme Court.",
      "The documents case was one of two that Smith brought against Trump. In Washington, D.C., he faced charges related to an alleged attempt to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election. The president-elect pleaded not guilty to the four counts he faced there, and the dispute landed before the Supreme Court as Trump argued presidential immunity shielded him from prosecution.",
      "He was also charged by local prosecutors in separate cases in Fulton County, Georgia, and New York City.

      "He was set to be sentenced last month in New York, but it was delayed.",
      "The Fulton County case involved an alleged plot by Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. He pleaded not guilty to charges in the sprawling racketeering case brought by District Attorney Fani Willis. Proceedings had been halted, though, while a state appeals court considered whether Willis should be disqualified from the case. It's unclear how Trump's victory will affect his prosecution in Fulton County.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:26:14 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump, who ran on mass deportation and harsher immigration policies, could inherit a border that is relatively quiet.",
    "story": [
      "Unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border are on track to drop to a new low for the Biden administration in November, according to internal Customs and Border Protection figures obtained by CBS News.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol is on pace to record fewer than 50,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border unlawfully this month. The agency has been averaging roughly 1,550 apprehensions between legal border entry points each day so far in November, according to the internal data.",
      "While U.S. officials had been worried about a spike in migrant crossings after President-elect Donald Trump won the presidential election, due to his promises to seal the southern border, that has not materialized \u2014 at least not yet. In fact, illegal border crossings dropped slightly after Election Day.",
      "If the trend holds, illegal border crossings in November will be below the 54,000 apprehensions logged by Border Patrol in September, the current Biden-era low. The last time illegal border crossings were lower was in the summer of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic sharply reduced migration.",
      "Spikes in migrants journeying to the U.S. border have bedeviled Republican and Democratic presidents alike. But migrant apprehensions soared to record highs under Mr. Biden, peaking at 250,000 in December. The Trump-era monthly high was 133,000 in May 2019.",
      "The current four-year-low in illegal immigration reflects a broader decrease that began earlier this year and that has been mainly attributed to efforts by the Mexican government to stop migrants from reaching American soil and asylum restrictions enacted by President Biden in June.",
      "That stringent asylum policy has dramatically cut the number of migrants released into the U.S. and allowed to apply for legal protection, government statistics show.",
      "Trump has vowed to enact even stricter measures, promising to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history and dismantle Biden administration programs that allow certain migrants to enter the country legally. Under one of those policies, the U.S. is currently processing about 40,000 migrants each month at official border crossings after they secure appointments through a smartphone app.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas argued the Biden administration built a new border policy \"model\" that both enforces U.S. law and adheres to the country's values.",
      "\"Through tough measures at our border, newly-built capabilities to remove people more quickly, the construction of lawful pathways that enable people to obtain relief in a safe and orderly way, and an unprecedented attack on the smuggling organizations, we have driven border encounters below their 2019 level, made the border more secure than it was then, and upheld our standing as a country of refuge for those who qualify under the law,\" Mayorkas said.",
      "The \"ultimate irony\"",
      "Trump made the situation at the border under Mr. Biden central to his campaign, and his hardline immigration proposals resonated with many voters. Mass deportation, for example, continues to enjoy support from a majority of Americans, CBS News polling shows. But Trump could very well inherit a border that is relatively quiet.",
      "\"It is an ultimate irony, and it is going to put Trump in a position of declaring victory,\" said Doris Meissner, who led the now-defunct Immigration Naturalization Service during the Clinton administration and currently serves as a senior fellow at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute.",
      "The lull at the border, should it persist, could allow the incoming Trump administration to focus limited immigration enforcement resources in the interior of the country, to carry out the president-elect's mass deportation plan, which faces formidable logistical hurdles.",
      "With roughly 6,000 law enforcement officers and 41,000 detention beds, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch currently lacks the manpower and resources to arrest, detain and deport the millions of unauthorized immigrants Trump and his allies have promised to expel from the country.",
      "Trump's top advisers have floated proposals to tap into the Department of Defense's vast resources, including by using military planes for deportations and tasking National Guard soldiers with carrying out immigration arrests. But the feasibility \u2014 and legality \u2014 of those plans remain open questions.",
      "Meissner said the relative calm at the southern border could allow Trump's administration to redirect Border Patrol resources towards interior immigration enforcement.

      "President Biden pardoned two turkeys from Minnesota on Monday, in keeping with the annual White House turkey pardon tradition.",
      "It was Mr. Biden's final turkey pardon as president, before President-elect Donald Trump is tasked with keeping up the tradition. This year's turkeys, Peach and Blossom, are named after the Delaware state flower, the peach blossom, which symbolizes resilience, Mr. Biden said. The president joked that the more than 2,000 people who gathered for the event were there seeking a pardon, as he has less than two months in office.",
      "\"In the last four years, I've had the honor to continue that tradition by pardoning Peanut Butter and Jelly, Chocolate and Chip, Liberty and Bell,\" Mr. Biden told the crowd on the White House South Lawn, with the turkeys gobbling occasionally in the background. \"And today, Peach and Blossom will join the free birds of the United States of America.\"",
      "\"Based on your temperament and commitment to being productive members of society, I hereby pardon Peach and Blossom!\" he declared.",
      "But the president took a more serious tone as he concluded his remarks.",
      "\"Let me close on a more serious note\u2014 this event marks the official start of the holiday season here in Washington,\" he said. \"It's also my last time to speak here as your president during the season and give thanks and gratitude. So let me say to you, it's been the honor of my life. I'm forever grateful.\"",
      "The turkeys stayed in a luxurious suite at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel near the White House in the days leading up to their moment in the limelight, a tradition for the turkeys as they await their fate.",
      "John Zimmerman, this year's chairman of the National Turkey Federation, raises more than 100,000 turkeys every year, and said he selected two of his best.",
      "\"We want them to be prepared for the spotlight, we want them to get used to lights, noises and anything they will encounter in DC,\" he told CBS Minnesota. \"We expose them to different noises, lights. All sorts of music, from hard rock to polka to Prince.\"",
      "Both turkeys will head to Farmamerica: MN Agricultural Interpretive Center in Waseca, Minnesota, to live out the rest of their days in peace, away from anyone's Thanksgiving table.",
      "Last year, Mr. Biden pardoned \"Liberty\" and \"Bell,\" joking that they have a new appreciation for the words, \"'Let freedom ring.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Lloyd Doggett wishes he had called on President Biden to step aside far earlier.",
      "The Texan was at the forefront of what helped lead to a dramatic change in this year's presidential election when he urged Mr. Biden to end his reelection bid in July, becoming the first Democrat in Congress to\u00a0publicly break\u00a0with the commander-in-chief after a disastrous summer debate performance against Donald Trump.",
      "In the weeks that followed more than 30 Democrats called on the president to exit the contest, but Mr. Biden's eventual decision to leave the race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris failed to stop Trump from winning back the White House, the outcome many in the party feared would come to pass if Mr. Biden had remained at the top of the ticket.",
      "This is the season of second guessing on the left, a time of what-ifs and maybes. Doggett, 78, believes almost everyone holding elected office in his party bears \"some responsibility for the catastrophic defeat\" he says they were handed. In addition to losing the presidency and the Senate, Democrats also failed to take back control of the House from Republicans.",
      "\"President Biden, as far as legacy, has many successes to point to,\" Doggett said. \"But the most important success would have been had he stepped aside a year ago and given us a better chance of preventing Trump from coming back and doing all the damage that he will do to our country.\"",
      "Mr. Biden ran for the White House four years ago in an attempt to end Trumpism, touting his wisdom as an experienced political hand who had spent decades in the U.S. Senate and service for eight years as Barack Obama's vice president. He'll soon leave office at the age of 82, with his White House tenure wedged between Trump's first and second terms as president and a Republican-led Congress riled by Mr. Biden's tenure leading the nation.",
      "\"Jimmy Carter is going to be very happy now that he wasn't the worst president of my lifetime,\" Florida GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez gloated. \"\u2026.[Biden's] policies got pretty soundly defeated in this last election.\"",
      "As Democrats sort through the aftermath of what went wrong, among those in Congress who helped push him out of the 2024 race, there remains respect for what Biden accomplished.",
      "\"For where America was going at the time, he saved our democracy, at least for four years,\" Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley said.",
      "But hindsight has also brought about the belief that acting sooner might have made a difference.",
      "\"[Harris] ran a pretty good campaign, actually a really good campaign, and she had the disadvantages of not having the time to distance herself from Biden,\" California Rep. Scott Peters said. \"Every campaign you make mistakes. And because she had such a compressed time frame, she didn't really have time to recover from the mistakes. But I thought it was certainly better than the alternative. I think if the president had been on the ticket, it would've just been a slaughter.\"",
      "Back in 2019, Biden said he believed history would look back on four years of President Trump \"and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time.\" His campaign carried the implicit hope for Democrats that while Trump may have changed politics for the time being, defeating him would bring back a measure of civility in a nation that increasingly appeared to have long moved past wanting such courtesy.",
      "Now, Trump has found his way back to the White House after trying to overturn his loss in 2020 and spreading falsehoods that the election was stolen, claims that stirred the mob of his supporters who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. 2021 and scarred the normally peaceful transfer of power. He overcame indictments and a group of younger Republican primary challengers. He survived two assassination attempts and won a clear victory this fall, becoming the first man in over a century to be elected to non-consecutive terms as president.",
      "In this last election, many voters sided with a far different vision for America than the one espoused by Mr. Biden. Trump's approach is far more combative, his agenda centered around undocumented immigration and a vow to conduct mass deportations along with moves enticing the far right, like potential pardons for Jan. 6 rioters. He's also promised tariffs and tax changes targeted at Americans' economic concerns.",
      "Before July, Democratic leaders publicly shook off concerns about Mr. Biden's age and ability to win again, choosing instead to overhaul the party's primary process at his own urging, paving the way for him to face little resistance about his decision to run for reelection until after his fateful debate performance.",
      "In his lone White House term, Biden led the nation out of the coronavirus pandemic and worked with Democrats' narrow congressional majorities at the time to pass a $1.9 trillion relief proposal during his first 100 days in office, relying on that same power more than a year later to put in place a landmark plan to fight climate change, both being party-line initiatives praised by Democrats and fiercely opposed by Republicans.",
      "He signed into law major bipartisan bills on infrastructure, gun safety and domestic production of semiconductor computer chips. He helped bolster support for Ukraine as it faces Russia's brutal invasion, work that may soon be undercut given that notable Trump administration picks either haven't been supportive of providing continued assistance to Ukraine or have advocated for a negotiated end to the war.",
      "But inflation troubles drowned out other aspects of Mr. Biden's economic record while the border, immigration, and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan were key issues that Biden's presidency struggled with as he asked Democrats to get behind him for another term.",
      "\"Look, there's going to be a lot of punditry, a lot of election experts who are going to have their opinions, who are going to have their thoughts, but the president is very, very proud,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters after the election. \"Very proud of what he's been able to accomplish and incredibly impressed for what the vice president was able to do.\"",
      "A source familiar with the president's standing at the time said internal campaign polling \"showed a slight hit\" from the June 27 debate and contended that \"it wasn't until the circular firing squad picked up and there was regular coverage of Democrats calling for an exit that we really took more damage.\"",
      "Yet among the Democrats who called on him to leave the race before Mr. Biden dropped out on July 21, there is a sense that they were right, that they did what needed to be done even if it didn't get them where they wanted to be.",
      "\"In retrospect, I feel certain that Biden was facing certain defeat and that we were certainly going to see the loss of the House and the Senate, and I felt the House would be much worse than it is now,\" said California Democratic Rep. Mark Takano, who still regards Biden as having had an \"amazing run as the president.\"",
      "Others didn't share the same introspection.",
      "Even after going public with his call for Biden to end his campaign, Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown lost his own contest, a defeat which helped give Republicans the Senate and unified control of Washington. Reeling from his loss and facing reporters as he hurried through the Capitol a few days after the election, Brown said \"I don't have any thoughts on Biden's legacy.\"",
      "\"I'm just focused on what we need to do here these last few weeks,\" Brown said. \"I'm not a pundit.\"",
      "And the man who defeated Brown didn't hesitate to credit Mr. Biden for helping bring Trump back to power.",
      "\"Biden was the greatest thing to ever happen to President Trump because he showed the country how insane the left has gotten,\" said Bernie Moreno, the Republican who ousted Brown from his Senate seat.",
      "Mr. Biden isn't quite an afterthought in Washington \u2014 however, the spotlight that was so squarely trained on him for most of the last four years has drifted to Trump and the vision his allies on the right have for the president-elect's return to power.",
      "In these waning days of his presidency, Mr. Biden isn't the only one quietly finishing his tenure. Political life in the nation's Capitol rarely ends in climactic fashion, with most leaving the halls of power because of retirement or defeat rather than one final victory before calling it a career.",
      "Like Mr. Biden, Republican Utah Sen. Mitt Romney is a former party standard bearer. And like the president, his political career is coming to an end as a man they both opposed prepares to retake the White House, that \"aberrant moment\" Mr. Biden once described returning for an encore.",

Marco Rubio, who is Trump's pick to be secretary of state.",

But at the same time, there seems to be a sense of exhaustion, as fewer than half of Democrats feel motivated to oppose Trump right now.",

      "Trump and the economy",
      "After winning comes expectations. There's a net optimism about the incoming administration's effect on food and grocery prices, especially among Trump's voters. That comes as most Americans continue to say prices are currently rising. And inflation was a big factor in Trump winning in the first place.",
      "It may be no surprise then that among many potential items for the incoming administration, Americans say plans to lower prices ought to be the top priority.",
      "The percentage of Republicans who call the U.S. economy good, while still low, has gone up, as the percentage who call it very bad has dropped. That pushes voters' overall evaluation of the economy slightly higher than it's been this year \u2014 and further spotlights how much partisanship, along with optimism, always plays into these evaluations.",

      "A standoff in Congress has indefinitely delayed efforts to replenish the U.S. Small Business Administration's disaster loan fund, which offers emergency loans to help homeowners and businesses rebuild damaged properties.\u00a0 The loans are also used to help upgrade homes and businesses to prevent against future storm damage.\u00a0 The money can also be used to help offset the loss of sales during business closures.",
      "Despite warnings from the Biden administration that the federal fund for the loans would be fully exhausted by October, Congress departed Washington before Election Day without passing legislation to replenish the fund. And upon its return from its recess last week, the Senate held a hearing to discuss plans for future funding of the loan program. But no legislation has been drafted, nor has a date been set to vote on any measure to restore the money.",
      "\"There's always a concern about Congress moving sluggishly,\" Sen. Ted Budd, a North Carolina Republican, told CBS News, \"But I'm talking to my colleagues in the Senate to make sure this emergency funding goes through and that it is spent appropriately.\"",

      "Hawkins has shuttered the business until at least January or February. The restaurant suffered nearly $300,000 in damaged equipment, including its refrigeration units and fryers, which is a uniquely painful loss for a restaurant that's partly famous for its onion rings.",

      "In the meantime, the backlog of applications for emergency loans has skyrocketed in recent weeks, according to a CBS News review.\u00a0 A federal official said 12,000 disaster loans have been prepared for approval and funding, totaling approximately $1 billion in help. The Small Business Administration is also processing an additional 60,000 applications nationwide, as the impasse over funding in Congress continues.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, a former national security adviser to Donald Trump, said Sunday that the upcoming months will be \"really critical\" in determining the \"next phase\" of the war in Ukraine as the president-elect is expected to work to force a negotiated settlement when he enters office.",
      "McMaster, a CBS News contributor, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that Russia and Ukraine are both incentivized to make \"as many gains on the battlefield as they can before the new Trump administration comes in\" as the two countries seek leverage in negotiations.",
      "With an eye toward strengthening Ukraine's standing before President-elect Donald Trump returns to office in the new year, the Biden administration agreed in recent days to provide anti-personnel land mines for use, while lifting restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S.-made longer range missiles to strike within Russian territory. The moves come as Ukraine marked more than 1,000 days since Russia's invasion in February 2022.",
      "Meanwhile, many of Trump's key selection for top posts in his administration \u2014 Rep. Mike Waltz for national security adviser and Sens. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and JD Vance for Vice President \u2014 haven't been supportive of providing continued assistance to Ukraine, or have advocated for a negotiated end to the war.",
      "McMaster said the dynamic is \"a real problem\" and delivers a \"psychological blow to the Ukrainians.\"",
      "\"Ukrainians are struggling to generate the manpower that they need and to sustain their defensive efforts, and it's important that they get the weapons they need and the training that they need, but also they have to have the confidence that they can prevail,\" he said. \"And any sort of messages that we might reduce our aid are quite damaging to them from a moral perspective.\"",
      "McMaster said he's hopeful that Trump's picks, and the president-elect himself, will \"begin to see the quite obvious connections between the war in Ukraine and this axis of aggressors that are doing everything they can to tear down the existing international order.\" He cited the North Korean soldiers fighting on European soil in the first major war in Europe since World War II, the efforts China is taking to \"sustain Russia's war-making machine,\" and the drones and missiles Iran has provided as part of the broader picture.",
      "\"So I think what's happened is so many people have taken such a myopic view of Ukraine, and they've misunderstood Putin's intentions and how consequential the war is to our interests across the world,\" McMaster said.",
      "On Trump's selections for top national security and defense posts, McMaster stressed the importance of the Senate's advice and consent role in making sure \"the best people are in those positions.\"",
      "McMaster outlined that based on his experience, Trump listens to advice and learns from those around him. And he argued that the nominees for director of national intelligence and defense secretary should be asked key questions like how they will \"reconcile peace through strength,\" and what they think \"motivates, drives and constrains\" Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Trump has tapped former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence, who has been criticized for her views on Russia and other U.S. adversaries. McMaster said Sunday that Gabbard has a \"fundamental misunderstanding\" about what motivates Putin.",
      "More broadly, McMaster said he \"can't understand\" the Republicans who \"tend to parrot Vladimir Putin's talking points,\" saying \"they've got to disabuse themselves of this strange affection for Vladimir Putin.\"",
      "Meanwhile, when asked about Trump's recent selection of Sebastian Gorka as senior director for counterterrorism and deputy assistant to the president, McMaster said he doesn't think Gorka is a good person to advise the president-elect on national security. But he noted that \"the president, others who are working with him, will probably determine that pretty quickly.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: President-elect Trump makes a flurry of picks for top health and finance jobs. Will they pass muster with the Republican-controlled Senate?",
      "The Trump transition team unveiled almost a dozen people selected to fill key Cabinet and White House roles. And as would-be nominees are whisked through Capitol Hill to meet with senators, there's already been one major withdrawal, a quick replacement, and renewed scrutiny on some of the more controversial national security picks.",
      "We will talk with two key senators, Republican Rand Paul and Democrat Tammy Duckworth. They will be questioning the president-elect's choices on health, national security and more.",
      "One of Trump's national security advisers from his first term, retired Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, will also weigh in.",
      "Plus: As the conflict between Israel-Hamas and Hezbollah continues to rage, when can we expect a cease-fire? We will ask Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, who has called President Biden's handling of Israel shameful and a policy failure.",
      "Finally, we will hear from representative-elect Sarah McBride on the challenges and opportunities facing her as she prepares to take office as the first openly transgender member of Congress.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "As we begin this holiday week, Americans are preparing to gather to give thanks for what has been and contemplate what's to come. Our latest CBS News poll shows that 59 percent of Americans approve of how president-elect Donald Trump is handling the presidential transition.",
      "Trump has kept up a steady drumbeat of staffing announcements from his Mar- a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "And that is where we find our Nikole Killion this morning with the latest.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "NIKOLE KILLION (voice-over): After Saturday lunch with one of the senators who will vote on his Cabinet picks, president-elect Donald Trump announced former domestic policy adviser Brooke Rollins for agriculture secretary.",
      "One of his most highly anticipated selections was Scott Bessent for Treasury. If confirmed, the 62-year-old investor would be the first openly gay secretary to lead it and responsible for quarterbacking Mr. Trump's proposed policies on taxes and tariffs.",
      "DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. President-Elect): The most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff.",
      "NIKOLE KILLION: A new CBS News poll shows a majority of Americans support imposing tariffs on imported goods, and more have an optimistic view of the economy since the election.",
      "Mr. Trump selected a pair of doctors to lead health agencies. Former Congressman David Weldon has promoted debunked anti-vaccine views and is being tapped to lead the Centers for Disease Control. Food and Drug Administration pick Martin Makary critiqued vaccine mandates during the COVID pandemic.",
      "And Project 2025 architect Russ Vought plans to reprise his role as White House budget director, despite Trump's disavowal of the conservative policy blueprint.",
      "PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP: I have nothing to do with Project 2025.",
      "NIKOLE KILLION: Our polling also finds many of the president-elect's well- known designees have more support than opposition, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, and Pete Hegseth.",
      "The former FOX News host picked to lead the Pentagon is drawing scrutiny over allegations of sexual assault in a 2017 police report.",
      "Did you sexually assault a woman in Monterey, California?",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary Nominee): I have \u2013 as far as the media is concerned, I will keep this very simple. The matter was fully investigated. And I was completely cleared. And that's where I'm going to leave it.",
      "(End VT)",
      "NIKOLE KILLION: While president-elect Trump has filled out most of his Cabinet, a few economic positions remain up for grabs, including U.S. trade representative and small business administrator \u2013 Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Nikole Killion in West Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "We go now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is set to chair the Homeland Security Committee next year, and he sits on the Health Committee.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation, Senator.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you are a doctor by training.",
      "I want to ask you about some of these health picks. I know that you personally said that you have vaccinated all of your children, but vaccination rates in this country, as you know, are on the decline.",
      "Are you at all concerned that elevating individuals who have been publicly critical of some particular vaccines, RFK Jr. at HHS secretary, Dave Weldon to CDC director, that any of that will erode trust in vaccination?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I think all of us can agree that there's an increase of vaccine hesitancy.",
      "I think it comes from people not believing what the government is telling them. The fact that the CDC committee for vaccines and the FDA committee for vaccines said for COVID boosters that you should take a booster if you're over 65, and yet the Biden administration and Rochelle Walensky actually politicized that, didn't follow the signs and said you should boost your 6-month-old, and the American public is rejecting this.",
      "Only about 20 percent of the American public of all ages is taking the COVID booster, because the government hasn't been honest with us. That dishonesty has led to vaccine hesitancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's vaccination rates in other \u2013 other vaccines as well, not just COVID vaccines. There's concern about measles. There are concerns about other\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Right, but people have to believe it. Exactly.",
      "But people are doubting because they're being told that. I will give you an example. Look, I think vaccines, smallpox, the story of smallpox vaccine, polio vaccine are some of the most miraculous discoveries in all of medicine. And I'm not against vaccines.",
      "But, like, when my kids were little, the hepatitis B vaccine, they still want to give it to them as a newborn. I just \u2013 my baby is new and just, you know, come into the world, and you can see how a lot of reasonable people say, why do I have to do it as a newborn? Could I come back in three months or six months?",
      "So, really, it's about choice. It's about getting rid of mandates. It's about letting people participate, but it's also about the government being honest. What are the risks and what are the benefits? And they haven't been honest on COVID, because healthy children do not die from COVID, do not get seriously sick, and there's no proof that the vaccine has any medical benefit for healthy children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we want to move on to other topics, sir, but we will continue to cover vaccination in this country.",
      "I think what you said there is that you're supportive of all those health nominees, from what I heard. You \u2013 you have been \u2013 I'm sorry. Did you want to say\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I was just going to say, yes, I am supportive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But I wouldn't describe them as the problem with vaccine hesitancy. I would describe the government misinformation as the problem with vaccine hesitancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Messengers matter, though.",
      "But you have raised concerns in your role on Homeland Security about the implementation of some of the promises Donald Trump made on the campaign trail. His mass deportation vow is very popular. Our CBS polling shows 57 percent of voters like the idea, but how it is implemented matters a lot to voters.",
      "The vast majority prefer that federal law enforcement or immigration agencies carry them out. Just 40 percent say the U.S. military should be involved. The stated Trump plan is to use the military, military assets, deputize the National Guard, and have them act as immigration agents. Do you believe that is lawful?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I'm 100 percent supportive of going after the 15,000 murderers, the 13,000 sexual assault perpetrators, rapists, all these people.",
      "Let's send them on their way to prison or back home to another prison. So I would say all-points bulletin, all in, but you don't do it with the Army because it's illegal. And we've \u2013 we've had a distrust of putting the Army into our streets, because the police have a difficult job, but the police understand the Fourth Amendment. They have to go to judges. They have to get warrants. It has to be specific.",
      "And so I'm for removing these people, but I would do it through the normal process of domestic policing. Now, I would say that the mayor of Denver, if he's going to resist federal law, which there's a longstanding history of the supremacy of federal law, if he's going to resist that, it will go all the way to the Supreme Court.",
      "And I would suspect that he would be removed from office. I don't know whether or not there'd be a criminal prosecution for someone resisting federal law, but he will lose. And people need to realize that what he is - - what he is offering is a form of insurrection, where the states resist the federal government.",
      "Most people objected to that and rejected that long ago. So I think the mayor of Denver is on the wrong side of history, and, really, I think, will face legal ramifications if he doesn't obey the federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, just context on those numbers you rattled off in terms of criminals, those numbers from ICE are accurate figures, but they're over a 40-year period of time.",
      "What we know now about the immigration authorities who would have to be charged with rounding these individuals up, there are just 6,000 agents, 41,000 detention beds to carry out the assignment of rounding up millions of undocumented people, potentially.",
      "How do you suggest they implement it? And if this is a red line for you in terms of using the military, would you vote no on the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I will not support and will not vote to use the military in our cities. I think it's a terrible image.",
      "But I will tell you that, just in the last week, with the belief that a new administration will change things, there were four or five criminals arrested in the last week. And what would happen and I think what will happen under Donald Trump's administration is, I don't recommend to use the Army, but I would use the FBI, I would use ICE, I would use Border Patrol.",
      "And they have a list now of 15,000. I don't care if it came in over 40 years or 10 years. If you've got a list, you put these people on an all- points bulletin, these are the kind of people that are dangerous and that everybody needs to be the watch on, and they would go out and seek those people.",
      "That \u2013 we have about 30,000 very dangerous people already convicted of crimes. That should be the first priority for all of this. Let's go find those people. But it's not about detaining them. In all likelihood, they should be going to a jail, either a jail here or in the country they came from.",
      "So I think, if we did that, there will be a lot of unity. If they send the Army into New York, and you have 10,000 troops marching, carrying semiautomatic weapons, I think it's a terrible image, and I will oppose that. But it's not that I oppose removing people. I just\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 object to what has been against the law for over 100 years, and that's using the Army.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But deputizing the National Guard, that specifically is the proposal. You also oppose that?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't think it's the best way to do it. It's less clear whether that's legal or illegal. Typically, it has to be done at the behest of the governors.",
      "I still don't like a militarization of police, whether it's National Guard or Army. I think there's a lot of FBI.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: There's a lot of Border Patrol agents. There's a better way to do it. And it needs to be individualized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: That doesn't mean I'm any less serious about getting it done. It just needs to be done according to the law and consistent with our traditions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "You've made clear you are a fiscal conservative. I want to ask you about the choice just made to select hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as the treasury secretary. He had a long financial career. He served as the Chief Investment Officer for George Soros' funds. He's been a political donor.",
      "Elon Musk came out publicly against him, calling him business as usual. Do you favor Mr. Bessent in the role as Treasury secretary?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I have heard good things about him. I haven't made a decision. I lean towards being supportive.",
      "I don't like tariffs, but, then again, I don't like the president promoting tariffs. I think tariffs are a tax on the consumer, and they ignore things like with steel. There are 80 workers working in steel-buying industry for every worker making steel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So, yes, you can protect certain industries, but it's at the expense of other people.",
      "I don't believe that will be enough for me to want to vote against Bessent, because it's also the president's position as well. I will be vocal in saying that I think tariffs are bad and that international trade actually saves every consumer about $7,000 a year. So, everybody in our country is $7,000 richer because of international trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It's part of one of the booms of postwar and post- Industrial Revolution. This amazing international trade has made us all richer, and we need to talk about the statistics and facts concerning the benefits of trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood on the nuances and specifics there, but that is primarily how Donald Trump is promising to pay for all the things he promised on the campaign trail.",
      "As you know, the federal debt is past $36 trillion as of this week. His proposals to lift taxes off of tips, overtime, Medicare, Social Security, give tax credits, that could add as much as $8 trillion more to the deficit, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget.",
      "Do you actually expect Republicans to take up these proposals?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, in 2017, I voted for a tax reduction package that they said would add to the debt, but I also forced my colleagues to vote for pay-as-you-go. It's a policy that's in our law, and they have to waive it, which means that if a tax cut causes a reduction and causes an increase in the debt because of reduced revenue, that you have to have spending cuts.",
      "So, I have always been in favor of the tax cuts, but I have also been in favor of the spending cuts. The same will occur with this. If we do cut spend \u2013 cut taxes, which I think helps the economy, you leave money in the hands of the productive private sector, I think that's a good idea. But if you do it, I would cut spending.",
      "And there will be procedural blockade or procedural votes that I will force that says that we should also cut spending as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that the vast majority of Americans, 86 percent, prefer people with experience running the agencies, and 64 percent polled by us think it's important to appoint people with that experience in Washington.",
      "Given that, for example, the Pentagon pick hasn't ever managed a large corporation or held a high rank in the military, do you think he can run the Pentagon?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes.",
      "And I think the vast majority of people, if you poll them, will say that they don't think people should be picked based on religion or gender or sexuality. They want people to be picked on merit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And one of one of Pete Hegseth's criticisms of our Pentagon is that we've gone away from merit\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 and gone more towards racial characteristics.",
      "And so I think that the people are and would be overwhelmingly in favor\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 of someone who's going to base hiring on merit, not on racial characteristics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Senator Paul, thank you for your time today.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth of the state of Illinois. She sits on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-Illinois): Good morning. Thanks for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, former Congressman Matt Gaetz took himself out of the running this week to become attorney general.",
      "This was after he had met with senators. And CBS has reported that as many as 15 Republicans opposed him. Does that suggest to you that your Republican colleagues in the Senate will hold the line, or are you still concerned they will just green-light anyone Trump nominates?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I'm deeply concerned that they will green- light. I'm glad that they held the line on him.",
      "I'm also glad that they voted the way they did for the Republican leader, but that was in the secret ballot when they elected Senator Thune. And, you know, Mr. Trump's main choice for that position was not selected.",
      "But from what I'm hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point of Defense, since you sit in this advisory role on Armed Services, I don't have to tell you, but, for our audience, there are over 200,000 American women who serve in active duty service right now, thousands of them in front-line combat roles.",
      "You were one of them in 2004, when your Black Hawk helicopter you were piloting was shot at by an RPG, and you sustained severe injuries.",
      "Here is what Mr. Trump's pick for defense secretary said about women serving:",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary Nominee): I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do your colleagues who sit with you on Armed Services believe that Mr. Hegseth's statement there is an issue that he needs to perhaps retract?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I think they need to, because he's wrong.",
      "Our military could not go to war without the 220,000-plus women who serve in uniform. The women in our military does make us more effective, does make us more lethal.",
      "And let me just make one thing clear. The women who are in those very particular roles, whether it's in Special Forces or the SEALs or the infantry, they meet the same standards as the men. And so he's been out there saying that, you know, women are not as strong, we don't \u2013 the ones who are in those roles have met the same standards as the men and have passed the very rigorous testing.",
      "And so he's just flat-out wrong. Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform. And, frankly, America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Having served in combat yourself, what do you think of the idea that women make fighting more complicated? That was specifically what he focused on.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, it just shows his lack of understanding of where our military is.",
      "He was a pretty low-ranking guy in the military, and he never had a command position. He was a platoon leader, I think, once or twice, but he never even commanded a company. And so this is a man who is inordinately unqualified for the position.",
      "Remember that the Pentagon is three million servicemen and women and civilians. It is over a $900 billion budget. He's never, you know, run anything anywhere near to that size. And, frankly, women actually make our military more effective.",
      "And I have personally found that I brought many insights to my job when I was a company commander, when I was a logistics officer that came from my own personal background that made things better. I took better care of my men, for example, in my unit. I was often the only woman in an all-male unit, and my gender didn't have \u2013 wasn't a problem.",
      "I just adapted, and we continued to perform the mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The question of character has also come up in regard to this leadership role. Mr. Hegseth has acknowledged that he paid a woman back in 2017 to quiet her accusations of sexual assault. He claims it was consensual sex.",
      "I'm sure you read that Monterey police report, as we did here. It refers to the offense code as \u2013 quote \u2013 \"rape, victim unconscious of the nature of the act.\" It details both the accuser's and Hegseth's version of events.",
      "Here's what Senator Markwayne Mullin said it shows: \"two people flirting with each other.\"",
      "Is the committee going to speak with the victim to ask if this was a misunderstanding?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, that's \u2013 that will be the decision of the Republican chairman of the committee next year.",
      "I hope that we will. But I suspect that they, again, will roll over for Mr. Trump. Frankly, I will make \u2013 raise those questions. Remember that we've just fought over a decade of fights and \u2013 and overhauled the military and its treatment of military sexual trauma.",
      "It's frankly an insult and really troubling that Mr. Trump would nominate someone who has admitted that he's paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him. This is not the kind of person you want to lead the Department of Defense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To move to a vote you took this past week, you said you have disgust at the brutal tactics used by the Netanyahu government in Gaza, but you voted against all three resolutions of disapproval this past week that would have paused very specific offensive weapons shipments to Israel.",
      "Your colleague Senator Van Hollen said it's just about getting Israel to comply with U.S. law. How do you respond to that? Why shouldn't they be held to the same standards as other recipients of U.S. aid?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I respect Senator Van Hollen's position. And, in fact, I have cosigned many of the letters that he's led that has called on Israel to comply with humanitarian standards across the world.",
      "My decision comes from my military experience, the fact that many of these rounds were not going to be delivered for a couple of years, the fact that, you know, these are resolutions. They don't actually have binding effect. And, frankly, for me, my decision came from the fact that we have tens of thousands of US troops in harm's way right now.",
      "And I am deeply concerned that a resolution that doesn't actually do anything might embolden the Houthis and the Iranian regime and Hamas to further target and \u2013 American troops abroad. So I respect Chris. He and I are good friends. We were freshmen in the Senate together, but we come at this from slightly different angles, mine from 23 years of military experience.",
      "But I do share his concern about the brutal way that Israel has acted in Gaza. And, you know, I have cosigned many of his letters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that there is a desire among the American people to see Democrats and Republicans work together in this future Trump administration.",
      "With that in mind, I'm looking at some of these nominees, including Trump's pick for labor secretary. She is drawing praise from unions because she is perceived as \u2013 as pro-union. Could you see yourself supporting her or any of the other nominees?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Absolutely.",
      "I \u2013 you know, what I would need to do is have a chance to sit down and talk with each one of these nominees, and listen to them and hear what they have to say. I think Congressman Collins over at VA, he's the nominee for VA, is another person I can talk with. In fact, I worked with him when I was in the House a few years back.",
      "I am going to evaluate each one of these candidates based on their ability to do the job and their willingness to put the needs of the American people first and not be on a retribution campaign and a \u2013 for Mr. Trump.",
      "So it's about, are they willing to be independent and do the job that they are being nominated to do, and are they competent and qualified for the position?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Duckworth, we appreciate your time this morning.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're now joined by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): It's great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in these final days of Democratic control of the Senate and the White House, there's a long to-do list. Congress has to fund the government by end of December, pass the defense bill, the NDAA, an extension to the farm bill, and I know Democrats want to confirm as many judges as possible. What's top of your list?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, all of those are on the list. Top of my list is also the disaster relief funding. Emergency relief. We had big parts of the country hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters. In my state of Maryland, we had the collapse of the Key Bridge in Baltimore. So, we've always taken the approach that the whole country will be there to help fellow Americans in need. The president has now submitted $100 billion emergency disaster relief plan that includes funding for the Key Bridge. So, I hope that we will get that done by the end of the year. People need that relief and they need it now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's about $8 billion for the bridge alone, is that right?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Not for the bridge alone. This is - that's part of the emergency relief fund that includes approximately $2 billion for the bridge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. And you're relatively confident that this can be delivered on?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I hope that all of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, will support disaster relief.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: We've always had the philosophy, all for one and one for all when Americans get hit by these disasters. I hope we will stick with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we also are looking at a new Congress very soon and, as you know, a new commander in chief. Republicans will have the majority in the Senate with 53 seats, so they don't really need Democratic votes to confirm many of the picks that Mr. Trump has been making to run agencies.",
      "But from what you've seen to date, are you in favor of any of them, your colleague, Marco Rubio, as secretary of State, for example, or this new choice to be Labor secretary?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Look, my view is, this is what the vetting process is all about, the hearing process. The Senate, of course, under the Constitution, has the job of advising and consenting on nominations. And I take that responsibility very seriously.",
      "I've been troubled by some talk that President-elect Donald Trump wants to short circuit that constitutional approach using this recess appointment device, and it will be really important that the new republican leader in the Senate uphold the Senate's prerogatives under the Constitution and not try to do an end run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll stay tuned to see how that plays out.",
      "Let's turn to the Middle East. You said that President Biden's inaction to halt the horrific humanitarian situation inside of Gaza is a stain on his administration, that it's shameful. Is there anything in these final weeks that could be done to erase that stain?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I think there are things that can be done. And I should emphasize that I supported President Biden's decision to travel to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks of October 7th of last year, and stand with the people of Israel as they confront this threat. But I also wish the president had effectively used U.S. leverage to essentially assert his own positions. We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage. So, I do hope in these closing months the president will finally make more effective use of American leverage to, at the very least, uphold American law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: To insist that the Netanyahu government allows humanitarian aid into Gaza, and that they use our weapons in a manner consistent with the laws of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you take a nuanced and specific stand on that, upholding U.S. law. This is often characterized, though, as being for or against helping Israel. There were 19 senators, you were one of them, who voted this past week to pause specific shipments on three different groups of weapons, offensive weapons, to Israel. You said the State Department's reviewing 500 incidents where U.S. weapons were used and caused unnecessary civilian harm. The State Department has said Israel's doing things to fix the situation, which is why weapons continue to be green lit. Are you suggesting that's a lie?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I'm suggesting that the president of the United States is not fully complying with American law on this question. If you look at the letter that was sent by Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken to Israeli authorities in October, you look at that final paragraph, you'll see that they're complaining about the fact that there is no effective mechanism right now for getting to the bottom of claims of civilian harm. The State Department has, as I said, about 500, as you said, and we haven't gotten to the bottom of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Because the process is broken, and I would argue that there's not been the will to fix the process because a lot of people don't want the process to produce the obvious answer, which is, there have been many cases where we've seen U.S. weapons used in violation of the international humanitarian law. In fact, if you go back to the NSM 20 report earlier this year, the Biden administration said specifically that there was a high likelihood that U.S. weapons were being used in violation of international law, and yet they've done nothing in the intervening period to enforce that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed U.S. officials on this privately, they've said, what do you want us to do? Do you want us to put in a halt for a few weeks? And then Donald Trump reverses it. What's the point? How do you respond?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the point is, they should have been doing this for a much longer period of time. The president had ample opportunities over the last year. There are many people in the administration, senior level - at the senior level who told me that this war was going to come to an end back in January. You know, I've met with hostage families on numerous occasions who have been calling out Prime Minister Netanyahu for not agreeing to a ceasefire and a return of their loved ones. Minister Gallant, the defense minister of Israel, was fired because he wanted to prioritize the return of hostages, and yet President Biden has never called out Prime Minister Netanyahu.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: For his obstruction on this. Even though those families I've met with are calling him out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even post-election, why do you think he won't do that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I really don't know. I just don't know why the president of the United States has not been willing to make more effective use of American leverage to assert his own stated objectives. I mean he's been ignored on other things, too, right? He wants the PA to be the nucleus of governance in a post-war Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Palestinian Authority.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: He wants a two-state solution. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not only ignored those, he's gone out there and bragged about how he's blocking President Biden's efforts. And yet the blank check just keeps on coming. So, what my colleagues and I are saying is, let's just pause these transfers of offensive weapons, certain ones, until Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government come into compliance with American law. These are American laws on the books.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, this is not about whether we support Israel or not. Of course we support Israel. It's about whether our support is used in a manner consistent with American law and American values.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for explaining your position.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to retired Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who served as national security adviser in the first Trump administration. His latest book is \"At War with Ourselves,\" which chronicles his time at the White House.",
      "Good morning, and welcome back.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER (Retired, Former White House National Security Adviser): Good morning, Margaret. Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Happy early Thanksgiving to you.",
      "I want to ask you about the geopolitical threat picture right now that the next commander in chief will be walking into the Oval Office and facing. In these final weeks of the Biden administration, Ukraine has started using U.S.-made ATACMS, a type of longer range missile, to strike within Russian territory. President Biden also approved anti-personnel land mines. The aim is to get them on stronger footing before Trump takes office.",
      "Can these weapons quickly make a difference?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: They can make a difference, Margaret. Really it made no sense to not allow the Ukrainians to fire those missiles at the bases that Russia was using to continue their onslaught against the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian infrastructure. And so, it's another one of these example how the Biden administration has taken this halting approach to providing weapons and then permissions to use weapons.",
      "And so, I think it's - it's important because both sides right now are incentivized to make as many gains on the battlefield as they can before the new Trump administration comes in. And you see Russia throwing troops into Ukrainian defenses. I mean, they're taking - you know, they're taking tens of thousands of casualties a month. I think it's really an unsustainable rate. And what the Ukrainians are doing now is trying to protect themselves from the onslaught, inflict as many casualties as they can, and they're trading some - some space for time and the opportunity to cause more attrition on Russian forces.",
      "So, the next couple of months, I think, are really critical in terms of the - you know, how - what is the next phase in the war in Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, President Zelenskyy said just yesterday that he's sure Vladimir Putin is trying to, quote, \"push us out by January 20th,\" and try to demonstrate that he has the upper hand. He's not saying that, you know, just as an observation. He is looking at the national security adviser, Mike Waltz. He's looking at the possible next secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who has voted against Ukraine aid. The vice president-elect is against helping Ukraine. Can Ukraine get the upper hand here, and are these top advisers going to be persuadable?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is a real problem, Margaret. You know, I think what you're seeing is, this delivers a psychological blow to the Ukrainians. Ukrainians are struggling to generate the manpower that they need and to sustain their defensive efforts. And that's - it's important that they get the weapons they need and the training that they need, but also they have to have the confidence that they can prevail. And any sort of messages that we might reduce our aid are quite damaging to them from a moral perspective.",
      "I think he'll - and what I hope is that those who President Trump has nominated, and President Trump himself will begin to see the quite obvious connections between the war in Ukraine and this axis of aggressors that are doing everything they can to tear down the existing international order.",
      "I mean, heck, Margaret, I mean North Korean soldiers are fighting on European soil in the first major war in Europe since World War II. Look at what China's doing to sustain Russia's war-making machine with the cash Vladimir Putin needs but also with the equipment and the hardware necessary to build these missiles that are continuing this onslaught. Iran. Iran is providing the drones and missiles. North Korea's also providing, you know, eight million rounds of artillery. So, I think what's happened is, so many people have taken such a myopic view of Ukraine and they've misunderstood Putin's intentions and how consequential the war is to our interests across the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things - and you are a historian. You've written quite a lot and looked at presidential decision making. One of the things you've written in \"At War with Ourselves\" was, \"it is important,\" based on your study of the Vietnam War, \"to ensure that the president gets the best analysis and multiple options so he can make informed decisions.\"",
      "Do you think so far that Mr. Trump's choices for director of national intelligence, for defense secretary, are these individuals who will provide the president with the best analysis and what he needs to hear, not just what he wants to hear?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is what the Senate has to - has to really exercise their advice and consent role. And I think it's worth going back to Federalist 76 where John Adams said, really this advice and consent is so important to make sure the best people are in those positions. President Trump, as I wrote in the book, he does learn. He does listen to advice. He does evolve his understanding. So, who will those people be?",
      "I think for the new secretary of defense, the nominated director of national intelligence, they ought to be asked, what do you think motivates or drives and constrains Vladimir Putin? There's a fundamental misunderstanding based on - on the nominee for - for the - for DNI about what motivates him. It's not his security concerns. His security concerns don't need to be allayed. That's the mistake the Biden administration made. And I think as a result almost green lighted the invasion - the reinvasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.",
      "What are the consequences if - if Ukraine fails and Russia succeeds globally? I think, Margaret, they have got to be asked about, you know, really, how do they reconcile or help President Trump reconcile peace through strength and what you see in some elements of the Republican Party which replicate the far left oftentimes toward retrenchment and disengagement and then even blaming ourselves for the acts of our adversaries as - as - as Tulsi Gabbard has done, you know, talking about, you know, how Putin really felt aggrieved. And that's why he had to invade Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, that's a Russian talking point that she's repeated and in direct contradiction (ph) to what U.S. intelligence has concluded.",
      "I also want to ask you about someone you personally -",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And this is what - this is what I can't understand, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: There's some - there's some people in the Republican Party these days who kind of tend to parrot Vladimir Putin's talking points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: I don't know if it's because they're drawn to him and they see him as a - kind of a defender of western civilization, just a shirtless guy on horseback, but they've got to disabuse themselves of this, you know, strange affection for Vladimir Putin. You know, who - who is - who is not going to stop in his efforts to restore Russia to national greatness at our expense. That's what he's obsessed with. He's obsessed with kind of re-establishing the Russian empire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And so he has aspirations that go far beyond anything that's in reaction to what we do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And the only thing that stops him really is strength, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you wrote in your book that you didn't understand Donald Trump's fascination with Vladimir Putin.",
      "Quickly, Seb Gorka is going to be the senior director for counterterrorism, deputy assistant to the president. Is he a good person to advise on national security?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: No, no, he's not, Margaret. But I - you know, I think that - that the president and others who are working with him will probably determine that pretty quickly soon after he gets into that job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, timestamp on that prediction. H.R. McMaster, a lot to talk to you about. We're going to have to leave it there for today.",

And throughout that experience, while Andy ultimately lost his life, we both knew how lucky we were. We knew how lucky Andy was to have health insurance that would allow him to get care that would hopefully save his life. And we both knew how lucky we were to have flexibility with our employers that allowed Andy to focus on the full- time job of getting care and me to focus on the full-time job of being there by his side to care for him, to love him, to marry him, and to walk him to his passing.",

I believe it should be the law of the land. And it's why during my time in the Delaware general assembly I passed paid family and medical leave and secured the largest investment in our state's Medicaid program. And I want to do that work in Congress on health care, but also on housing and childcare.",

He's not saying that, you know, just as an observation, he is looking at the national security adviser, Mike Waltz. He's looking at the possible next Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who has voted against Ukraine aid, the Vice President Elect is against helping Ukraine. Can Ukraine get the upper hand here, and are these top advisers going to be persuadable?",
      "LT. GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is a real problem, Margaret. You know, I think what- what you're seeing is, this delivers a psychological blow to the Ukrainians. Ukrainians are struggling to generate the manpower that they need and to sustain their defensive efforts. And that's- it's important that they get the weapons they need and the training that they need, but also they have to have the confidence that they can prevail. And any sort of messages that we might reduce our aid are quite damaging to them from a moral perspective. I think, and what I hope, is that those who President Trump has nominated, and President Trump himself, will begin to see the quite obvious connections between the war in Ukraine and this axis of aggressors that are doing everything they can to tear down the existing international order. I mean, heck, Margaret, I mean, North Korean soldiers are fighting on European soil in the first major war in Europe since World War II. Look at what China is doing to sustain Russia's war making- making machine, with the cash Vladimir Putin needs, but also with the equipment and the hardware necessary to build these missiles that are continuing this onslaught. Iran- Iran is providing the Shahed drones and missiles. North Korea is also providing, you know, 8 million rounds of artillery. So I think what's happened is so many people have taken such a myopic view of Ukraine, and they've misunderstood Putin's intentions and how consequential the war is to our interests across the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things, and you are a historian, you've written quite a lot and looked at presidential decision making. One of the things you've written in \"At War With Ourselves,\" was, it is important, based on your study of the Vietnam War, to \"ensure that the president gets the best analysis and multiple options so he can make informed decisions.\" Do you think so far, that Mr. Trump's choices for Director of National Intelligence, for Defense Secretary, are these individuals who will provide the President with the best analysis and what he needs to hear, not just what he wants to hear?",
      "LT. GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is what the Senate has to- has to really exercise their advice and consent role. And I think it's worth going back to Federalist 76, where John Adams said, really, this- this advice and consent is so important to make sure the best people are in those positions. President Trump, as I wrote in the book, he does learn, he does listen to advice. He does evolve his understanding. So who will those people be? I think, for the new Secretary of Defense, the nominated Director of National Intelligence, they- they ought to be asked, or- what do you think motivates or drives and constrains Vladimir Putin? There's a fundamental misunderstanding based on- on the nominee for- for the- for- for DNI about what motivates him. It's not his security concerns. His security concerns don't need to be allayed. That's the mistake the Biden administration made, and I think, as a result, almost green lighted the invasion, the reinvasion of Ukraine in February of 2022. What are the consequences if Ukraine fails and Russia succeeds, globally? I think, Margaret, they have got to be asked about, you know, really, how do they reconcile, or help President Trump reconcile, peace through strength? And what you see in some elements of the Republican Party, which replicate the far left, oftentimes, toward retrenchment and disengagement and then even blaming ourselves for the acts of our adversaries, as- as- as Tulsi Gabbard has done, you know, talking about how- how Putin really felt aggrieved, and that's why he had to invade Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, that's- that's a Russian talking point that she's repeated, and in direct contravention to what U.S. intelligence has concluded. I also want to ask about someone you--",
      "LT. GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: This is what- this is what I can't understand, Margaret. There's so- there's some people in the Republican Party these days which kind of tend to parrot Vladimir Putin's talking points. I don't know if it's because they're drawn to him and they see him as a kind of a defender of Western civilization, just the shirtless guy on horseback, but they've got to disabuse themselves of this, you know, strange affection for Vladimir Putin. You know, who- who is- who is not going to stop in his effort to restore Russia to national greatness at our expense. That's what he's obsessed with. He's obsessed with kind of reestablishing the Russian Empire. And so he has aspirations that go far beyond anything that's in reaction to what we do. And the only thing that stops it, really, is strength, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you wrote in your book that you didn't understand Donald Trump's fascination with Vladimir Putin. Quickly, Seb Gorka is going to be the Senior Director for Counterterrorism, Deputy Assistant to the President. Is he a good person to advise on national security?",
      "LT. GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: No, no, he's not, Margaret. But, you know, I think that- that the President, others who are working with him, will probably determine that pretty quickly, soon after he gets into that job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Time stamp on that prediction. H.R. McMaster, a lot to talk to you about. We're going to have to leave it there for today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 24, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're now joined by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, good to have you here.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: It's great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in these final days of democratic control, the Senate and the White House has a long to-do list. Congress has to fund the government by the end of December, pass the defense bil l-the NDAA- and extension to the farm bill. And I know Democrats want to confirm as many judges as possible. What's top of your list?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, all of those are on the list. Top of my list is also the disaster relief funding- emergency Relief. We had big parts of the country hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters. In my state of Maryland, we had the collapse of the Key Bridge in Baltimore. So we've always taken the approach that the whole country will be there to help fellow Americans in need. The President has now submitted a $100 billion emergency disaster relief plan that includes funding for the Key Bridge. So I hope that we will get that done by the end of the year. People need that relief, and they need it now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's about $8 billion for the bridge alone. Is that right?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Not for the bridge alone. This- that's part of the Emergency Relief Fund that includes approximately $2 billion for the bridge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're relatively confident that this can be delivered on?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I hope that all of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike will support disaster relief. We've always had the philosophy\" all for one and one for all\" when Americans get hit by these disasters, I hope we will stick with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we also are looking at a new Congress very soon, and as you know, a new commander-in-chief. Republicans will have the majority in the Senate with 53 seats, so they don't really need Democratic votes to confirm many of the picks that Mr. Trump has been making to run agencies. But from what you've seen to date, are you in favor of any of them, your colleague, Marco Rubio, as Secretary of State, for example. Or this new choice to be labor secretary?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Look, my view is this is what the vetting process is all about. The hearing process. The Senate, of course, under the Constitution, has the job of advising and consenting on nominations, and I take that responsibility very seriously. I have been troubled by some talk that President-elect Trump wants to short circuit that constitutional approach using this recess appointment device, and it will be really important that the new Republican leader in the Senate uphold the Senate's prerogatives under the Constitution and not try to do it and run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll stay tuned to see how that plays out. Let's turn to the Middle East. You said that President Biden's inaction to halt the horrific humanitarian situation inside of Gaza is a stain on his administration that it's shameful. Is there anything in these final weeks that could be done to erase that stain?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I think there are things that can be done, and I should emphasize that I supported President Biden's decision to travel to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks of October 7 of last year and stand with the people of Israel as they confront this threat. But I also wish the President had effectively used US leverage to essentially assert his own positions. We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely, and then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage. So, I do hope in these closing months, the President will finally make more effective use of American leverage to at the very least uphold American law, to insist that the Netanyahu government allows humanitarian aid into Gaza and they use our weapons in a manner consistent with the laws of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you take a nuanced and specific stand on that upholding, US law. This is often characterized, though, as being for or against helping Israel. There were 19 senators, you were one of them who voted this past week to pause specific shipments on three different groups of weapons, offensive weapons, to Israel. You said the State Department is reviewing 500 incidents where US weapons were used and caused unnecessary civilian harm. The State Department has said Israel is doing things to fix the situation, which is why weapons continue to be greenlit. Are you suggesting that's a lie?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I'm suggesting that the President of the United States is not fully complying with American law on this question. If you look at the letter that was sent by secretaries Austin and Secretary Blinken to Israeli authorities in October, you look at that final paragraph, you'll see that they're complaining about the fact that there is no effective mechanism right now for getting to the bottom of claims of civilian harm. The State Department has, as I said, about 500 as you said. And we haven't gotten the bottom of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Because the process is broken, and I would argue that there's not been the will to fix the process, because a lot of people don't want the process to produce the obvious answer, which is, there have been many cases where we've seen US weapons used in violation of international humanitarian law. In fact, if you go back to the NSM-20 report earlier this year, the Biden administration said specifically that there was a high likelihood that US weapons were being used in violation of international law, and yet they've done nothing in the intervening period to enforce that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed US officials on this privately, they've said, \"What do you want us to do? You want us to put in a halt for a few weeks and then Donald Trump reverses it. What's the point?\" How do you respond to that?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, the point is, they should have been doing this for a much longer period of time. The President had ample opportunities over the last year. There are many people in the administration, senior level- at the senior level, who told me that this war was going to come to an end back in January. You know, I met with hostage families on numerous occasions who have been calling out Prime Minister Netanyahu for not agreeing to a cease fire and a return of their loved ones. Minister Gallant, the defense minister of Israel was fired because he wanted to prioritize the return of hostages, and yet, President Biden has never called out Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Why?--",
      "SEN. VAN HALLEN: \u2013for his obstruction on this, even though those families I've met with are calling him out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even post-election, why do you think he won't do that?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I really don't know. I just don't know why the President of the United States has not been willing to make more effective use of American leverage to assert his own stated objectives. I mean, he's been ignored on other things too, right? He wants the PA to be the nucleus of governance in a post-war Gaza--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- the Palestinian Authority--",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: He wants a two-state solution. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not only ignored those he's gone out there and bragged about how he's blocking President Biden's efforts, and yet the blank check just keeps on coming. So what my colleagues and I are saying is, let's just pause these transfers of offensive weapons, certain ones, until Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government come into compliance with American law. These are American laws on the books. So this is not about whether we support Israel or not. Of course, we support Israel. It's about whether our support is used in a manner consistent with American law and American values.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for explaining your position. Thank you. We'll be right back."

      "SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): Good morning, thanks for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, former Congressman Matt Gaetz took himself out of the running this week to become Attorney General. This was after he had met with senators, and CBS has reported that as many as 15 Republicans opposed him. Does that suggest to you that your Republican colleagues in the Senate will hold the line, or are you still concerned they will just green light anyone Trump nominates?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, I'm deeply concerned that they will green light. I'm glad that they held the line on him. I'm also glad that they voted the way they did for the Republican leader, but that was in the secret ballot when they elected Senator Thune. And you know, Mr. Trump's main choice for that position was not selected. But from what I'm hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point of defense, since you sit in this advisory role on armed services, I don't have to tell you, but for our audience, there are over 200,000 American women who serve in active duty service right now. Thousands of them in front line combat roles. You were one of them in 2004 when your Black Hawk helicopter you were piloting was shot at by an RPG and you sustained severe injuries. Here is what Mr. Trump's pick for defense secretary said about women serving.",
      "[ PETE HEGSETH SOT ]",
      "PETE HEGSETH: I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.",
      "[ END SOT ]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do your colleagues who sit with you on armed services believe that Mr. Hegseth's statement there is an issue that he needs to perhaps retract?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, I think they need to, because he's wrong. Our military could not go to war without the 220,000 plus women who serve in uniform. The women in our military does make us more effective, does make us more lethal. And let me just make one thing clear, the women who are in those very particular roles, whether it's in special forces or the COs or the infantry, they meet the same standards as the men. And so he's been out there saying that, you know, women are not as strong. We don't. The ones who are in those roles have met the same standards as the men and have passed the very rigorous testing. And so he's just flat out wrong. Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform. And frankly, America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Having served in combat yourself, what do you think of the idea that women make fighting more complicated? That was specifically what he focused on.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, it just shows his lack of understanding of where our military is. He was a pretty low ranking guy in the military, and he never had a command position. He was a platoon leader, I think, once or twice, but he never even commanded a company. And so this is a man who is inordinately, unqualified for the position. Remember that the Pentagon is 3 million servicemen and women and civilians. It is over a $900 billion budget. He's never, you know, run anything anywhere near to that size. And frankly, women actually make our military more effective. And I've personally found that I brought many insights to my job. When I was a company commander, when I was a logistics officer, that came from my own personal background, that made things better. I took better care of my men, for example, in my unit. I was often the only woman in an all male unit, and my gender didn't have- wasn't a problem. I just adapted, and we continue to perform the mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The question of character has also come up in regard to this leadership role. Mr. Hegseth has acknowledged that he paid a woman back in 2017 to quiet her accusations of sexual assault. He claims it was consensual sex. I'm sure you read that Monterey police report, as we did here. It refers to the offense code as, \"rape: victim unconscious of the nature of the act.\" It details both the accuser's and Hegseth's version of events. Here's what Senator Markwayne Mullen said it shows: \"two people flirting with each other.\" Is the committee going to speak with the victim to ask if this was a misunderstanding?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH",
      "Well, that's- that will be the decision of the Republican chairman of the committee next year. I hope that we will, but I suspect that they, again, will roll over for Mr. Trump. Frankly, I will raise those questions. Remember that we've just fought over a decade of fights and- and overhauled the military and its treatment of military sexual trauma. It's frankly an insult and really troubling that Mr. Trump would nominate someone who has admitted that he's paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him. This is not the kind of person you want to lead the Department of Defense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "This past week, your committee did review a number of military promotions, nearly 1000 of them, and one name that seems to have been left off the list, despite the Pentagon's recommendation, was Lieutenant General Christopher Donahue. He was- he became known as the last U.S. service person to leave Afghanistan back in 2021, a key role there. Sources tell CBS that it is your Republican senator colleague, Senator Mullen, who stood in the way of this. I'm told it's out of a desire to hold those accountable for Afghanistan. What do you make of this? And is there a chance it could move?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH",
      "Well, if he is fully qualified for the move and for the promotion, he should come before the committee, the whole committee, not one member of the committee, and we should consider him. Remember that I wrote the legislation that created the Afghan War Commission. So we are actually undergoing, right now, an active, multi-year review of what happened in Afghanistan. And that was a bipartisan commission. We passed that law in a bipartisan way, and I hope the committee will be allowed to move forward with reviewing what happened to- in Afghanistan. It's, you know, you're not going to get a full picture by holding one person's promotion up. Frankly, he needs to come before the full committee, and we need to decide, and it's not Markwayne Mullen's decision whether or not one promotion comes before the committee.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Well, I ask because there are concerns about whether there will be generals held to account by Mr. Trump, as he said, he thinks others should be fired for Afghanistan. But to move to a vote you took this past week, you said you have disgust at the brutal tactics used by the Netanyahu government in Gaza, but you voted against all three resolutions of disapproval this past week that would have paused very specific offensive weapons shipments to Israel. Your colleague, Senator Van Hollen, said, it's just about getting Israel to comply with U.S. law. How do you respond to that? Why shouldn't they be held to the same standards as other recipients of U.S. aid?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, I respect Senator Van Hollen's position, and in fact, I have co-signed many of the letters that he's led that has called on Israel to comply with humanitarian standards across the world. My decision comes from my military experience, the fact that many of these rounds were not going to be delivered for a couple of years, the fact that, you know, these are resolutions, they don't actually have binding effect. And frankly, for me, my decision came from the fact that we have tens of thousands of US troops in harm's way right now, and I am deeply concerned that resolution, that doesn't actually do anything, might embolden the Houthis and the Iranian regime and Hamas to further target and American troops abroad. So I respect Chris. He and I are good friends. We were freshmen in the Senate together, but we come at this from slightly different angles, mine from 23 years of military experience, but I do share his concern about the brutal way that Israel has acted in Gaza, and you know, I've co-signed many of his letters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that there is a desire among the American people to see Democrats and Republicans work together in this future Trump administration. With that in mind, I'm looking at some of these nominees, including Trump's pick for labor secretary, former Congresswoman Lori Chavez DeRemer. She is drawing praise from unions because she is perceived as- as pro- union. Could you see yourself supporting her or any of the other nominees?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Absolutely, I- you know, what I would need to do is have a chance to sit down and talk with each one of these nominees, and listen to them and hear what they have to say. I think Congressman Collins, over at VA, he's the nominee for VA, is another person I can talk with. In fact, I worked with him when I was in the House a few years back. I am going to evaluate each one of these candidates based on their ability to do the job and their willingness to put the needs of the American people first and not be on a retribution campaign for Mr. Trump. So it's about were they willing to be independent and do the job that they are being nominated to do, and are they competent and qualified for the position?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Duckworth, we appreciate your time this morning.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Thank you",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more \"Face the Nation.\" Stay with us."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is set to chair the Homeland Security Committee next year, and he sits on the Health Committee. Welcome back to \"Face The Nation,\" Senator.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you are a doctor by training. I want to ask you about some of these health picks. I know that you personally said that you have vaccinated all of your children, but vaccination rates in this country, as you know, are on the decline. Are you at all concerned that elevating individuals who have been publicly critical of some particular vaccines, RFK jr. at HHS Secretary, Dave Weldon, the CDC director, that any of that will erode trust in vaccination?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, I think all of us can agree that there's an increase of vaccine hesitancy. I think it comes from people not believing what the government is telling them. The fact that the CDC committee for vaccines and the FDA committee for vaccines said for COVID boosters that you should take a booster if you're over 65 and yet the Biden administration, Rochelle Walensky, actually politicized that, didn't follow the signs and said you should boost your six-month-old. And the American public is rejecting this. Only about 20% of the American public of all ages is taking the COVID booster because the government hasn't been honest with us. That dishonesty has led to vaccine hesitancy\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Well its vaccination rates in other- other vaccines as well not just COVID vaccines. There's concern about measles\u2013",
      "SEN. PAUL: \u2013Right but people have to believe it, right exactly, but people are doubting because they're being told that. I'll give you an example. Look, I think vaccines, smallpox, the story of smallpox vaccine, polio vaccine, are some of the most miraculous discoveries in all of medicine. And I'm not against vaccines, but like when my kids were little, the hepatitis B vaccine, they still want to give it to them as a newborn. I just- my babies new and just, you know, come into the world, and you can see how a lot of reasonable people say, Why do I have to do it as a newborn? Could I come back in three months or six months? So really, it's about choice. It's about getting rid of mandates. It's about letting people participate, but it's also about the government being honest. What are the risks and what are the benefits? And they haven't been honest on COVID, because healthy children do not die from COVID, do not get seriously sick, and there's no proof that the vaccine has any medical benefit for healthy children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well we want to move on to other topics, sir, but we will continue to cover vaccination in this country. I think what you said there is that you're supportive of all those health nominees. From what I heard you, you have been- I'm sorry, did you want to say?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I was just going to say, yes, I am supportive,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SEN. PAUL: But I wouldn't describe them as the problem with vaccine hesitancy. I would describe the government misinformation as the problem with vaccine hesitancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Messengers matter, though, but you have raised concerns in your role on Homeland Security about the implementation of some of the promises Donald Trump made on the campaign trail. His mass deportation vow is very popular. Our CBS polling shows 57% of voters like the idea, but how it is implemented matters a lot to voters. The vast majority prefer that federal law enforcement or immigration agencies carry them out. Just 40% say the US military should be involved. The stated Trump plan is to use the military, military assets, deputize the National Guard and have them act as immigration agents. Do you believe that is lawful?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, I'm 100% supportive of going after the 15,000 murderers, the 13,000 sexual assault perpetrators, rapists, all these people. Let's send them on their way to prison or back home to another prison. So I would say All-points bulletin, all in but you don't do it with the Army because it's illegal. We've, we've had a distrust of putting the army into our streets, because the police have a difficult job but the police understand the Fourth Amendment. They have to go to Judges. They have to get warrants. It has to be specific. And so I'm for removing these people, but I would do it through the normal process of domestic policing. Now, I would say that the mayor of Denver, if he's going to resist federal law, which there's a longstanding history of the supremacy of federal law, he's going to resist that it will go all the way to the Supreme Court. And I would suspect that he would be removed from office. I don't know whether or not there'd be a criminal prosecution for someone resisting federal law, but he will lose. And people need to realize that what he is- what he is offering, is a form of insurrection, where the states resist the federal government. Most people objected to that and rejected that long ago. So I think the mayor of Denver is on the wrong side of history, and really, I think will face legal ramifications if he doesn't obey the federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just context on those numbers you rattled off in terms of criminals, those numbers from ICE are accurate figures, but they're over a 40 year period of time. The. What we know now about the immigration authorities who would have to be charged with rounding these individuals up. There are just 6,000 agents, 41,000 detention beds to carry out the assignment of rounding up millions of undocumented people, potentially. How do you suggest they implement it? And if this is a red line for you in terms of using the military, would you vote no on the DHS Secretary Kristi Noem?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I will not support and will not vote to use the military in our cities. I think it's a terrible image. But I will tell you, but just in the last week, with the belief that a new administration will change things, there were four or five criminals arrested in the last week. And what would happen, and I think what will happen under Donald Trump's administration is, I don't recommend to use the army, but I would use the FBI, I would use ICE, I would use Border Patrol. And they have a list now of 15,000 I don't care if it came in over 40 years or 10 years. If you've got a list. You put these people on an All-points bulletin. These are the kind of people that are dangerous and that everybody needs to be the watch on. And they would go out and seek those people that we have about 30,000 very dangerous people already convicted of crimes, that should be the first priority for all of this. Let's go find those people. But it's not about detaining them, in all likelihood, they should be going to a jail, either a jail here or in the country they came from. So I think if we did that, there will be a lot of unity. If they send the army into New York, and you have 10,000 troops marching carrying semi automatic weapons, I think it's a terrible image, and I will oppose that. But it's not that I oppose removing people. I just\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Right",
      "SEN. PAUL: Object to what has been against the law for over 100 years, and that's using the army.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But deputizing the National Guard. That specifically is the proposal. You also oppose that?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I don't think it's the best way to do it. It's less clear whether that's legal or illegal. Typically, it has to be done at the behest of the governors. I still don't like a militarization of police, whether it's National Guard or army. I think there's a lot of FBI, there's a lot of border patrol agents. There's a better way to do it, and it needs to be individualized. That doesn't mean I'm any less serious about getting it done. It just needs to be done according to the law and consistent with our traditions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You've made clear you are a fiscal conservative. I want to ask you about the choice just made to select hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as the treasury secretary. He had a long financial career. He served as the Chief Investment Officer for George Soros' funds. He's been a political donor. Elon Musk came out publicly against him, calling him business as usual. Do you favor Mr. Bessent in the role as Treasury secretary?",
      "SEN.\u00a0 PAUL: You know, I've heard good things about him. I haven't made a decision. I lean towards being supportive. I don't like tariffs, but then again, I don't like the president promoting tariffs. I think tariffs are a tax on the consumer, and they ignore things like with steel, there are 80 workers working in steel-buying industry for every worker making steel. So yeah, you can protect certain industries, but it's at the expense of other people. I don't believe that will be enough for me to want to vote against best and because it's also the President's position as well. I will be vocal in saying that I think tariffs are bad and that international trade actually saves every consumer about $7,000 a year. So everybody in our country is $7,000 richer because of international trade. It's part of one of the booms of post-war and post-industrial revolution. These amazing international trade has made us all richer, and we need to talk about the statistics and facts concerning the benefits of trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood on the nuances and specifics there, but that is primarily how Donald Trump is promising to pay for all the things he promised on the campaign trail. As you know, the federal debt is past $36 trillion as of this week. His proposals to lift taxes off of tips, overtime, Medicare, Social Security, give tax credits that could add as much as $8 trillion more to the deficit, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget. Do you actually expect Republicans to take up these proposals?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, in 2017 I voted for a tax reduction package that they said would add to the debt, but I also forced my colleagues to vote for pay-as-you-go, it's a policy that's in our law, and they have to waive it, which means that if a tax cut causes a reduction and causes an increase in the debt because of reduced revenue that you have to have spending cuts. So, I've always been in favor of the tax cuts, but I've also been in favor of the spending cuts. The same will occur with this. If we do cut- cut taxes, which I think helps the economy, you leave money in the hands of the productive private sector. I think that's a good idea, but if you do it. I would cut spending, and there will be procedural blockade or procedural votes that I will force, that says that we should also cut spending as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that the vast majority of Americans, 86% prefer people with experience running the agencies, and 64% polled by us, think it's important to appoint people with that experience in Washington. Given that, for example, the Pentagon pick hasn't ever managed a large corporation or held a high rank in the military, do you think he can run the Pentagon?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Yes, and I think the vast majority of people, if you poll them, will say that they don't think people should be picked based on religion or gender or sexuality. They want people to be picked on merit. And one of one of Pete Hegseth's criticisms of our Pentagon is that we've gone away from merit\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013yes",
      "SEN. PAUL: and gone more towards racial characteristics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK\u2013",
      "SEN. PAUL: \u2013And so I think that the people are, and would be, overwhelmingly in favor",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK\u2013",
      "SEN. PAUL: -Of someone who's going to base hiring on merit not on racial characteristics.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth said that Pete Hegseth is \"flat-out wrong\" in his view that women should not serve in the military in combat roles.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth said Sunday that Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary is \"flat-out wrong\" in his view that women should not serve in the military in combat roles.",
      "\"Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform,\" Duckworth said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And frankly, America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons.\"",
      "Trump tapped Hegseth, a former Fox News host and Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as his pick to head the Defense Department earlier this month. The 44-year-old has drawn criticism for his stance on women in combat roles, along with his level of experience.",
      "Duckworth, who in 2004 deployed to Iraq as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot and sustained severe injuries when her helicopter was hit by an RPG, outlined that women who serve in combat roles have met the same standards as men, passing rigorous testing. She said Hegseth's position \"just shows his lack of understanding of where our military is,\" while arguing that he's \"inordinately unqualified for the position.\"",
      "\"Our military could not go to war without the 220,000-plus women who serve in uniform,\" Duckworth said. She added that having women in the military \"does make us more effective, does make us more lethal.\"",
      "Hegseth has also drawn scrutiny amid recently unearthed details about an investigation into an alleged sexual assault in 2017. Hegseth denies the allegation and characterized the incident as a consensual encounter. The Monterey County district attorney's office declined to file charges as none were \"supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" His lawyer has acknowledged that Hegseth paid a confidential financial settlement to the woman out of concern that the allegation would jeopardize his employment.",
      "Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who serves on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, said it's \"really troubling\" that Trump would nominate someone who \"has admitted that he's paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him.\"",
      "\"This is not the kind of person you want to lead the Department of Defense,\" she added.",
      "The comments come after Trump announced a slew of picks for top posts in his administration in recent days. Meanwhile, one pick \u2014 former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general \u2014 has already withdrawn his name from consideration after he faced intense scrutiny amid a House Ethics Committee investigation and a tenuous path to Senate confirmation.",
      "While Duckworth acknowledged that she's glad her Senate Republicans \"held the line\" on Gaetz and also elected Sen. John Thune as leader over a candidate favored by many in Trump's orbit, she said she's \"deeply concerned\" her Republican colleagues will green light Trump's nominees.",
      "\"From what I'm hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump,\" Duckworth said.",
      "But Duckworth didn't rule out supporting some of the nominees herself during the Senate confirmation process, pledged to evaluate each candidate based on their ability to do the job, and their willingness to put the needs of the American people before \"a retribution campaign for Mr. Trump.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a CBS News poll released on Sunday found that 33% of Americans say Hegseth is a \"good choice\" for defense secretary, including 64% of Trump voters. But 39% of Americans said they hadn't heard enough yet about the pick. More broadly, Americans generally say they want Trump to appoint people who'll speak their minds and who have experience in the field or agency they'll run.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said he believes that Hegseth can run the massive Defense Department, despite his lack of experience managing a large organization. Though he did not address Hegseth's comments about women in combat roles, Paul said he believes the \"vast majority of people\" support leaders who are picked based on merit, citing Hegseth's criticism of the Pentagon for what he says has been a move away from merit-based hiring and toward hiring based on \"racial characteristics.\"",

      "Fred Harris, a former U.S. senator from Oklahoma, presidential hopeful and populist who championed Democratic Party reforms in the turbulent 1960s, died Saturday. He was 94.",
      "Harris' wife, Margaret Elliston, confirmed his death to The Associated Press. He had lived in New Mexico since 1976.",
      "\"Fred Harris passed peacefully early this morning of natural causes. He was 94. He was a wonderful and beloved man. His memory is a blessing,\" Elliston said in a text message.",
      "Harris served eight years in the Senate, first winning in 1964 to fill a vacancy, and made unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1976.",
      "\"I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of my longtime friend Fred Harris today,\" Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham wrote in a post to social media. \"Harris was a towering presence in politics and in academia, and his work over many decades improved New Mexico and the nation. \u00a0He will be greatly missed.\"",

      "It fell to Harris, as chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 1969 and 1970, to help heal the party's wounds from the tumultuous national convention in 1968 when protesters and police clashed in Chicago.",
      "He ushered in rule changes that led to more women and minorities as convention delegates and in leadership positions.",
      "\"I think it's worked wonderfully,\" Harris recalled in 2004, when he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Boston. \"It's made the selection much more legitimate and democratic.\"",
      "\"The Democratic Party was not democratic, and many of the delegations were pretty much boss-controlled or -dominated. And in the South, there was terrible discrimination against African Americans,\" he said.",
      "Harris ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, quitting after poor showings in early contests, including a fourth-place win in New Hampshire. The more moderate Jimmy Carter went on to win the presidency.",
      "Harris moved to New Mexico that year and became a political science professor at the University of New Mexico. He wrote and edited more than a dozen books, mostly on politics and Congress. In 1999 he broadened his writings with a mystery set in Depression-era Oklahoma.",
      "Throughout his political career, Harris was a leading liberal voice for civil rights and anti-poverty programs to help minorities and the disadvantaged. Along with his first wife, LaDonna, a Comanche, he also was active in Native American issues.",
      "\"I've always called myself a populist or progressive,\" Harris said in a 1998 interview. \"I'm against concentrated power. I don't like the power of money in politics. I think we ought to have programs for the middle class and working class.\"",
      "\"Today 'populism' is often a dirty word because of how certain leaders wield power,\" Heinrich said in his statement Saturday. \"But Fred represented a different brand of populism \u2014 one that was never mean or exclusionary. Instead, Fred focused his work and attention on regular people who are often overlooked by the political class.\"",
      "Harris was a member of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, the so-called Kerner Commission, appointed by then-President Lyndon Johnson to investigate the urban riots of the late 1960s.",
      "The commission's groundbreaking report in 1968 declared, \"our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2014 separate and unequal.\"",
      "Thirty years later, Harris co-wrote a report that concluded the commission's \"prophecy has come to pass.\"",
      "\"The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer and minorities are suffering disproportionately,\" said the report by Harris and Lynn A. Curtis, president of the Milton S. Eisenhower Foundation, which continued the work of the commission.",
      "Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute said Harris rose to prominence in Congress as a \"fiery populist.\"",
      "\"That resonates with people...the notion of the average person against the elite,\" Ornstein said. \"Fred Harris had a real ability to articulate those concerns, particularly of the downtrodden.\"",
      "In 1968, Harris served as co-chairman of the presidential campaign of then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey. He and others pressed Humphrey to use the convention to break with Johnson on the Vietnam War. But Humphrey waited to do so until late in the campaign, and narrowly lost to Republican Richard Nixon.",
      "\"That was the worst year of my life, '68. We had Dr. Martin Luther King killed. We had my Senate seatmate Robert Kennedy killed and then we had this terrible convention,\" Harris said in 1996.",
      "\"I left the convention \u2014 because of the terrible disorders and the way they had been handled and the failure to adopt a new peace platform \u2014 really downhearted.\"",
      "After assuming the Democratic Party leadership post, Harris appointed commissions that recommended reforms in the procedures for selecting delegates and presidential nominees. While lauding the greater openness and diversity, he said there had been a side effect: \"It's much to the good. But the one result of it is that conventions today are ratifying conventions. So it's hard to make them interesting.\"",
      "\"My own thought is they ought to be shortened to a couple of days. But they are still worth having, I think, as a way to adopt a platform, as a kind of pep rally, as a way to get people together in a kind of coalition-building,\" he said.",
      "Harris was born Nov. 13, 1930, in a two-room farmhouse near Walters, in southwestern Oklahoma, about 15 miles from the Texas line. The home had no electricity, indoor toilet or running water.",
      "At age 5 he was working on the farm and received 10 cents a day to drive a horse in circles to supply power for a hay bailer.",
      "He worked part-time as a janitor and printer's assistant to help for his education at University of Oklahoma. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1952, majoring in political science and history. He received a law degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1954, and then moved to Lawton to practice.",
      "In 1956, he won election to the Oklahoma state Senate and served for eight years. In 1964, he launched his career in national politics in the race to replace Sen. Robert S. Kerr, who died in January 1963.",
      "Harris won the Democratic nomination in a runoff election against J. Howard Edmondson, who left the governorship to fill Kerr's vacancy until the next election. In the general election, Harris defeated an Oklahoma sports legend \u2014 Charles \"Bud\" Wilkinson, who had coached OU football for 17 years.",
      "Harris won a six-year term in 1966 but left the Senate in 1972 when there were doubts that he, as a left-leaning Democrat, could win reelection.",
      "Harris married his high school sweetheart, LaDonna Vita Crawford, in 1949, and had three children, Kathryn, Byron and Laura. After the couple divorced, Harris married Margaret Elliston in 1983. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available Saturday.",

      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on Ocean Beach sand dunes in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 2,200 miles north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, the Western Australia state government said. He was released from a Parks and Wildlife Service boat on Wednesday.",
      "The boat traveled for several hours from the state's most southerly city of Albany before the penguin was released into the Southern Ocean, but the government didn't give the distance in its statement.",
      "He had been cared for by registered wildlife caregiver Carol Biddulph, who named him Gus after the first Roman emperor Augustus.",
      "\"I really didn't know whether he was going to make it to begin with because he was so undernourished,\" Biddulph said in video recorded before the bird's release, shared by the government on Friday.",
      "\"I'll miss Gus. It's been an incredible few weeks, something I wouldn't have missed,\" she added.",

      "\"He absolutely loves his big mirror and I think that has been crucial in his well-being. They're social birds and he stands next to the mirror most of the time,\" she said.",

    "summary": "A volcano erupted in southern Iceland, near the town of Grindav\u00edk and the Blue Lagoon spa, marking the region's seventh eruption in a year.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland flared again late Wednesday night, marking the region's seventh eruption in just one year.",
      "Lava burst from a crack in the ground before midnight local time, originating in a spot where there has been a resurgence of volcanic activity. It happened quickly and sent a molten stream traveling toward the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's most famous tourist attraction. It's a geothermal spa set in a lava field just outside the town of Grindav\u00edk that draws nearly a million visitors each year.",
      "Tourists were evacuated from the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's national broadcaster R\u00daV\u00a0reported. Some can be seen venturing startlingly close to the magma, in an apparent effort to capture the eruption on their phones, in a video published by the broadcaster. Response crews ushered them to safety before the magma roiled farther over the area, covering a section of the parking lot adjacent to the Blue Lagoon as well as a critical pipeline that funnels hot water from a geothermal power station, called Svartsengi, into the spa and around the peninsula.",
      "Striking aerial footage of the situation also published by R\u00daV showed the expanse of the eruption. Fiery magma blankets the ground in the video, and thick smoke rises from it into the air.",
      "People were evacuated from about 50 homes Wednesday in Grindav\u00edk, a small fishing town on Iceland's southern peninsula, according to the country's Civil Protection Agency. The agency said it was unclear exactly which volcano was erupting, but noted the lava came from the same area experiencing volcanic activity.\u00a0Grindav\u00edk is some 30 miles south of Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland's capital city. Icelandic officials have not reported issues in the capital caused by the eruption.",
      "Officials said Thursday that volcanic activity was ongoing, with seismic monitors indicating the magma had spread over at least 7 square kilometers of land, slightly less than 4 1/2 square miles. The Njar\u00f0v\u00edk pipeline could still function Thursday beneath the magma, said the Icelandic Meteorological Office. Magma had crossed the road into Grindav\u00edk when the office shared its most recent update, but the eruption's peak had seemingly passed by then and the fissure from which it originated had shortened, according to measurements taken by the National Police Commissioner's special forces unit.",
      "Earthquakes in the area caused the ground to split and triggered the volcano, the office said. Iceland is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to\u00a0earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which have rocked portions of the country and displaced residents in recent years.",
      "It was the seventh time Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula experienced a volcanic eruption since December 2023, with multiple previous flares breaking out over the summer. Officials said the latest eruption was less severe than the last one, which happened in August and resulted in multiple ground fissures as well as a subsequent 4.1-magnitude earthquake. The August incident came just two months after an eruption continued spewing lava for more than three weeks.",
      "At the time, a regional police chief told Icelandic media that most of Grindav\u00edk's 4,000 residents had evacuated from their homes the prior November when the spell of volcanic activity started to kick up. While some had returned part-time to the town, few were comfortable staying overnight, the police chief said. Those who had returned were successfully evacuated.",
      "Before the Mount Fagradalsfjall eruption in March 2021, the Reykjanes peninsula had not seen volcanic activity in roughly 800 years. Since then, seismologists have carefully observed the reawakening of a long-dormant fault line running under the landscape.",

      "\"We're looking for the ripe cones on the top of the tree,\" said Brian Kittler, chief program officer for the Resilient Forests program at the nonprofit conservation group American Forests.",
      "Using lift operators and climbers, Kittler and his team showed CBS News how his team hunts for pine cones.",
      "\"The more that we lose forest, we're losing our clean air and clean water, our ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere and address climate change,\" Kittler said.",
      "The threat comes from the West's unprecedented breed of megafires which, fueled by climate change, have destroyed more than 33 million acres since 2020, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That's around the size of the state of Arkansas.",
      "If nothing is done to restore a forest after a wildfire, a vicious cycle begins. Fewer surviving trees means fewer pine cones for humans to pick and plant. That's what happened in the Fremont-Winema National Forest during the Barry Point Fire in 2012, Kittler said.",
      "\"There's basically no live trees, and there's no natural regeneration happening,\" Kittler said.",
      "Once the pine cones are collected, they're brought to a network of nurseries, where the seeds are extracted and grown into seedlings. One million seedlings will plant about 4,500 acres of new forest.",
      "But the program alone is not enough to restore the forest, said Brian Reatini, a geneticist with the U.S. Forest Service. He says they're short about 200,000 acres \u2014 and that's just in one part of Oregon.",
      "The warming environment also means fewer seedlings will likely grow to maturity, which takes about 20 years.",
      "\"It's become much more arid, hotter and dryer. One of the consequences of that, it can push trees towards the edge of what they can physiologically tolerate,\" Reatini said.",
      "To help combat that problem, they're sourcing seeds from more \"drought tolerant\" tree species.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed new protections for giraffes, saying their populations are threatened by poaching, habitat loss and climate change.",
    "story": [
      "Giraffe populations are in trouble \u2014 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday proposed listing three subspecies of the tall animals as endangered and two species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their populations have been declining because of poaching, habitat loss and climate change, officials said. While giraffes are not native to the U.S., listing them under the act would still provide protections to giraffe populations.",
      "The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1973, establishes protections for fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Under the act, federal agencies are required to ensure their actions are unlikely to jeopardize listed species, according to the agency.",
      "\"Federal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,\" USFWS Director Martha Williams said in a press release. \"This action supports giraffe conservation while ensuring the United States does not contribute further to their decline.\"",
      "Specifically, officials said the listing would help giraffes by reducing the illegal hunting and trade of giraffes by requiring permits for import into the U.S. Trade is not the primary factor behind population decline, but it is playing a role, USFWS said. Their hair and tails have long been used in traditional medicine, the agency added, and in recent years giraffes have also been targeted by hunters for bushmeat.",
      "Listing them under the Endangered Species Act would also increase funding for species conservation in range countries and for research efforts to address conservation. It would also provide some limited financial support for developing and managing programs to conserve giraffes, the USFWS said.",
      "Giraffe subspecies from across Africa are at risk, according to the agency. The service proposed listing West African, Kordofan and Nubian giraffes as endangered. It also proposed listing Masai and reticulated giraffes as threatened.",
      "The West African, Kordofan and Nubian \u2014 all subspecies of the northern giraffe \u2014 have seen their population fall around 77% since 1985, according to federal officials. There are around 5,900 left, including only about 690 West African giraffes remain.",
      "The vast majority of reticulated giraffes live in Kenya, and their population is estimated at 15,985, according to USFWS. There are around 45,400 Masai giraffes \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to 67% of their population in the 1970s.",
      "Giraffes feed on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits, so human population growth and habitat loss can hurt the species. Instances of drought have also led to increased human-wildlife conflicts.",
      "The proposed rule to list the giraffe species has a 90-day comment period.",

      "Barbara Mahoney, a NOAA biologist examining the whale, told the Anchorage Daily News the whale was likely 1 to 3 years old.",
      "Fin whales are the second-largest whale species, according to NOAA Fisheries, and fully grown can reach up to 85 feet long and weigh between 40 tons and 80 tons. Strikes by ships, entanglements in\u00a0fishing gear, underwater noise and the effects of climate change are among the threats that fin whales face, according to the agency.",
      "Mandy Keogh, a NOAA marine mammal stranding coordinator, said fin whales generally aren't seen this close to Anchorage and that recent high tides may have pushed the animal further into the Knik Arm.",
      "People trekked across the mudflats to see the whale, which NOAA biologists and staff from Alaska Veterinary Pathology Services had anchored to the shore Sunday so they would be able to gather samples from the animal. But even after samples are analyzed, it can be difficult to determine a cause of death because of decomposition or a lack of obvious injuries, Keogh said.",
      "Daisy Grandlinard was among the parents who accompanied a group of children to see the whale Monday. As they drew closer, they could smell it, she said.",
      "\"It was really interesting for the kids to be able to feel it, touch the bottom because it kind of had tracks on it, like a sled almost. And just to see the size of it, that was pretty cool,\" she said. \"We had already studied whales a couple of weeks ago, so it was fun to see one in person and say, 'Oh, that's what the baleen looks like in real life,' and 'Where is the blow hole?'\"",
      "Biologists hoped to complete their work Tuesday, untether the carcass and \"let the tide push it or move it,\" Mahoney said. \"Whatever it does or doesn't do \u2014 we don't know.\"",
      "According to NOAA, the whaling industry killed nearly 725,000 fin whales in the mid-1900's in the Southern Hemisphere alone. Today, the major threat to the species comes from vessel strikes.",
      "Other fin whales have washed ashore along the Western U.S. this year. In August, a large fin whale washed ashore in Southern California and died before rescuers could get to the scene, CBS Los Angeles reported. Officials said the whale, which was not fully grown, was believed to be in poor health due to visible bumps on its skin and a thin build.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:47:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \"digital alternative\" to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "Trump's election win boosts crypto",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. election.",

He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "Spot bitcoin ETFs",
      "Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Bitcoin volatility",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. Experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",

      "Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens submitted a sworn declaration to the transition team alleging that \"Mr. Epshteyn's overall tone and behavior gave me the impression of an implicit expectation to engage in business dealings with him before he would advocate for or suggest my appointment to the President.\"",
      "\"This created a sense of unease and pressure on my part,\" said the declaration, which was first obtained by the online publication Just the News and shared with CBS News. Greitens and his attorney, Timothy Parlatore, authenticated the one-page document to CBS News.",
      "Parlatore, who has been critical of Epshteyn in the past, confirmed to CBS News that the declaration was submitted in connection with an internal investigation that is being conducted by David Warrington, who served as general counsel to the Trump campaign. According to Parlatore, Warrington interviewed Greitens about his interaction with Epshteyn late last week and then asked Greitens to submit the declaration. Warrington has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"It was important to me to protect the president because I was concerned about the ethics of what was happening,\" Greitens told CBS News. \"Very specifically, I was concerned that there was an offer to advance a nomination in return for financial payments.\"",

      "Epshteyn has been a near-constant figure by Trump's side in recent years, buoying him on air and helping to coordinate his multiple legal teams behind closed doors. Those teams have had unquestionable success, impeding Trump's two federal criminal cases before they could get to trial, and stymying a state case against Trump in Georgia. Trump was convicted in the one case that went to trial, in New York, but recently the sentencing in that case was postponed indefinitely. On Monday, special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal district court to dismiss the charges against Trump stemming from an alleged scheme to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, and he also sought to end his bid to revive the case against Trump arising from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents.",
      "A native of Russia who emigrated to New Jersey with his family when he was 11, Epshteyn was brought into the Trump sphere by Georgetown University classmate Eric Trump. He started as a low-level staffer during Trump's first run for office and was able to parlay that into a junior position on the White House communications team. Two months later he abruptly resigned over circumstances that remain unclear, but by then he had managed to win over Trump as his loyal confidant and fixer.",
      "Eric Trump said Monday in a Fox News interview that \"I've known Boris for years, and I've never known him to be anything but a good human being.\" But he implied the allegations could have consequences for Epshteyn.",
      "\"I certainly hope the reporting is false and I can also tell you if it's true, you know, the person will probably no longer be around,\" Eric Trump said.",
      "Epshteyn supporters praise his ability to execute orders and resolve problems, which they attribute to a frenetic energy, his bulldog personality and a cunning understanding of the political dynamics of Trump's advisers. Epshteyn has become so close to Trump that the president-elect jokingly refers to Epshteyn as \"my psychiatrist,\" The New York Times first noted. According to multiple sources, Epshteyn's access to Trump is at times only rivaled by family members.",
      "In the weeks since Trump won his second term as president, Epshteyn has been a mainstay in discussions about filling out the Cabinet. The New York Times reported Epshteyn played a critical role in recommending former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general, a bid that ultimately failed to win favor and was withdrawn.",
      "The status of Epshteyn's consulting business while assisting in the transition is unclear. But prior to the 2024 election, the business appeared to be robust. A review of publicly available records indicate his firm has been paid more than $1 million from Trump's campaigns and aligned PACs since 2020, and another $1.2 million by other campaigns.",
      "While there is nothing new about political consultants \u2014 on both sides of the aisle \u2014 using their connections, interviews with about two dozen advisers, lawyers and allies of Trump reveal Epshteyn's political consulting work has bred both praise and resentment.",
      "CBS News spoke with more than half a dozen Republican candidates who have engaged with Epshteyn. Many described his pitch, offering an array of services, including \"strategic advice\" on messaging and boosting a candidate's social media presence. But nearly everyone interviewed said his access to Trump had allure.",
      "Ahead in the polls as his Republican Senate primary approached in 2022, Don Bolduc wanted to make sure Trump didn't play spoiler by endorsing one of his New Hampshire rivals. Bolduc said he turned to Epshteyn \"to run interference inside the Trump circle.\"",
      "A service like that doesn't come cheap. \"I thought $100,000 was a lot of money for what we were asking, but that's what was paid,\" said Bolduc, who added \"no guarantee\" was given by Epshteyn that Trump wouldn't endorse a rival.",
      "Bolduc won his primary after Trump stayed neutral. He told CBS News that while it appeared to him that he got what he paid for, the experience left him feeling disillusioned with the transactional side of elections. After the campaign ended in general election defeat, Bolduc said he chose to leave politics for good.",
      "\"There's nothing honorable about politics,\" said Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general. After his failed Senate race, Bolduc enrolled in a police academy and became a rookie small-town cop at age 60.",
      "After publication, Rick Wiley, a senior adviser on Bolduc's campaign, told CBS News that Epshteyn \"was retained by General Bolduc's campaign for strategic media consulting with conservative media outlets, and he delivered.\"",
      "Wiley listed three shows that Bolduc appeared on and said they enabled \"his campaign to reach supporters and voters throughout New Hampshire and across the country.\"",
      "Among those who hired Epshteyn for his campaign services in the past was Greitens, who served as Missouri governor during a portion of the first Trump term. In the weeks since Trump won reelection, Greitens said he contacted Epshteyn for assistance to be considered for an appointment as U.S. Navy secretary.",
      "\"During the conversation, despite the absence of an explicit offer, Mr. Epshteyn's comments and demeanor suggested that he might entertain offering a position in the administration in exchange for financial consideration, but such an offer would happen in a subsequent discussion,\" Greitens wrote. \"He stated that there would be 'time for that later' and that it was 'not time for that yet.'\"",
      "\"Mr. Epshteyn's overall tone and behavior gave me the impression of an implicit expectation to engage in business dealings with him before he would advocate for or suggest my appointment to the President,\" Greitens wrote. \"This created a sense of unease and pressure on my part.\"",

      "President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs.",
      "\"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\" he wrote on social media, complaining that \"thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,\" even though violent crime is down from pandemic highs.",
      "He said the new tariffs would remain in place \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country! \"",
      "The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices on everything from gas to automobiles. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data.",
      "Trump made the announcements on his Truth Social site Monday evening as he railed against an influx of illegal migrants.",
      "CBS News also reported Monday that unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border are on track to drop to a new low for the Biden administration in November, according to internal Customs and Border Protection figures.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol is on pace to record fewer than 50,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border unlawfully this month.",
      "Trump also turned his ire to China, saying he has \"had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States \u2013 But to no avail.\"",
      "\"Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether Trump will actually go through with the threats or if he is using them as a negotiating tactic before he takes office in the new year.",
      "Much of America's fentanyl is smuggled from Mexico. Border seizures of the drug rose sharply under President Joe Biden, and U.S. officials tallied about 21,900 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl seized in the 2024 government budget year, compared with 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president.",
      "Trump's nominee for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, if confirmed, would be one of several officials responsible for imposing tariffs on other nations. He has on several occasions said tariffs are a means of negotiation with other countries.",
      "He wrote in a Fox News op-ed last week, before his nomination, that tariffs are \"a useful tool for achieving the president's foreign policy objectives. Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to U.S. exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.\"",
      "If Trump were to move forward with the threatened tariffs, the new taxes would pose an enormous challenge for the economies of Canada and Mexico, in particular.",
      "They would also throw into doubt the reliability of the 2020 trade deal brokered in large part by Trump, which is up for review in 2026.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:55:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal judge to toss out the charges against President-elect Donald Trump in the case stemming from the 2020 election.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal judge overseeing the 2020 election case against former President Donald Trump agreed to dismiss the charges following a request from special counsel Jack Smith, bringing to a close the historic and unprecedented prosecution of the nation's 45th and 47th president.",
      "U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan granted Smith's request just hours after he said in a filing that he is seeking to close Trump's case because Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "\"After careful consideration, the department has determined that [the Office of Legal Counsel's] prior opinions concerning the Constitution's prohibition on federal indictment and prosecution of a sitting president apply to this situation and that as a result this prosecution must be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated,\" Smith wrote\u00a0in his filing. \"That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the government stands fully behind.\"",
      "The special counsel noted the historic nature of Trump's prosecution and subsequent election to the presidency, writing that the \"department and the country have never faced the circumstance here, where a federal indictment against a private citizen has been returned by a grand jury and a criminal prosecution is already underway when the defendant is elected president.\"",
      "But after consultation with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, the special counsel said \"the department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\"",
      "Smith said in his six-page motion that he conferred with Trump's lawyers, and they did not object to the request to drop the case. The special counse sought to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning prosecutors could decide to charge Trump again after he leaves office in January 2029.",
      "Chutkan said in a brief opinion that dismissing the case without prejudice is \"appropriate\" in part because it is \"consistent with the government's understanding that the immunity afforded to a sitting president is temporary, expiring when they leave office.\"",
      "In response to Smith's request to drop the charges, Steven Cheung, Trump's spokesman, said in a statement, \"The American people re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate to make America great again. Today's decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump and is a major victory for the rule of law. The American people and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.\"",
      "The judge's approval of Smith's request to dismiss the case and toss the four federal counts against the president-elect was expected. The special counsel is also likely to submit a final report to the attorney general and resign before Trump takes office. Smith's request was not a surprise, as he and the Justice Department were in talks about how to wind down the prosecution after Trump was elected to a second term earlier this month. The special counsel consulted with Attorney General Merrick Garland about the decision to drop the case.",
      "Smith was appointed special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 after Trump announced his third run for the White House. He took over two ongoing federal probes into Trump's conduct, one focused on his alleged mishandling of classified records and the other tied to the 2020 election.",
      "After a monthslong grand jury investigation, Smith obtained a four-count indictment against Trump that alleged he sought to resist the peaceful transfer of power following Joe Biden's electoral victory and allegedly engaged in a criminal scheme in the process. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and denied wrongdoing.",
      "The indictment laid out a sprawling scheme in which prosecutors accused Trump and his unnamed co-conspirators of working to undermine the legitimacy of the election results and halt the certification of the Electoral College votes in a bid to stay in power.",
      "Trump's legal team successfully delayed the case well into this year after they claimed Trump was immune from prosecution because he was president at the time the alleged conduct took place. Chutkan and a D.C. appeals court panel rejected the argument of presidential immunity. The case was put on hold as the Supreme Court then took up the matter.",
      "Ultimately, the high court issued a landmark decision in the case, ruling in July that presidents are immune from federal criminal prosecution for actions taken in their official capacity as president of the United States. The Supreme Court's 6-3 opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts allowed for charges to be filed when a president acted in an unofficial or personal capacity.",
      "Some of the alleged conduct included in Smith's 2023 indictment was disqualified from the case and the special counsel later secured a superseding indictment against Trump in an attempt to contour the charges to the Supreme Court's ruling. Trump pleaded not guilty to the new indictment earlier in September.",
      "Before Smith asked her to dismiss the case, Chutkan was in the midst of applying the Supreme Court's immunity decision to the case. In October, she made public a key filing from Smith that provided a comprehensive look at the evidence prosecutors amassed in their case against Trump. The special counsel and his team said that when he lost the 2020 race, Trump \"resorted to crimes\" to hold onto power.",
      "The filing described how Trump and his aides allegedly planned to challenge the results of the 2020 election well before Election Day and pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "In one striking passage, prosecutors said Trump replied, \"So what?\" when he was told that Pence could be in danger at the Capitol, where Congress had convened to tally state electoral votes. A mob of Trump's supporters breached the building, leading to the evacuation of Pence and lawmakers.",
      "The White House declined to comment on Smith's filing to dismiss the charges.",
      "\"I'd refer you to the Department of Justice, and I would just underline that the president is proud to have restored the independence of the Department of Justice when it comes to critical matters \u2014 criminal matters,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.",
      "The special counsel is expected to make a similar request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, where judges were considering whether Smith's other case against Trump \u2014 dealing with classified documents \u2014 should be revived after a Florida federal judge dismissed the case in July. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled Smith was unlawfully appointed to the role of special counsel by Garland and as a result, the case against Trump was invalid. The Justice Department appealed her ruling.",
      "In addition to the two federal cases, Trump was charged by local prosecutors in separate cases in Fulton County, Georgia, and New York City. The New York case stemmed from a hush-money payment made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels after the 2016 election, and a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies in May, making him the first former president convicted of a crime.",
      "He was set to be sentenced last month in New York, but it was delayed following the election. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him in the sprawling racketeering case in Fulton County, which is related to an alleged effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
      "Trump's bid for a second term loomed over his prosecutions, as it was widely expected his federal cases would be dropped if he succeeded in winning the White House.",
      "Now, with both of Smith's cases closer to being settled, he is likely to file a final report with the attorney general, as is required by special counsel regulations, and is expected to resign from his post before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20, 2025, two sources familiar with Smith's plans previously told CBS News. Garland pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed during his tenure \u2014 a commitment he has so far upheld \u2014 and he is likely to do so in the Smith cases, too. Prior special counsels have testified before Congress about their reports, and Smith could, as well.",
      "Should the public release of Smith's report stall for any reason and be delayed into the Trump administration, the odds of its disclosure become increasingly slim, since the president-elect has said he intends to nominate many of his top defense attorneys to leadership roles within the Justice Department.",
      "Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who defended Trump in the two federal cases and other matters in New York, are set to serve as deputy attorney general and principal associate deputy attorney general respectively, two powerful posts within the Justice Department. Trump has said he will nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi for the top job as attorney general.",
      "He has also selected D. John Sauer to serve as solicitor general, who represents the government before the Supreme Court. Sauer argued the immunity case on behalf of Trump in April.",

The special counsel appealed the decision, but has now asked the 11th Circuit to dismiss his appeal.",
      "In his brief filing, Smith cited a separate request to dismiss his other case involving Trump, which involves an alleged scheme to overturn the 2020 election.

      "The federal judge overseeing the 2020 election case agreed to drop the charges against Trump just hours after Smith filed his request, marking the culmination of the monthslong prosecution against the president-elect. In the documents case, dismissing the appeal as to Trump would leave in place the lower court's order tossing out the charges against him. The appeal will continue as to Trump's two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, because unlike the president-elect, \"no principle of temporary immunity applies to them,\" Smith wrote.",
      "\"The special counsel's decision to proceed in this case even after dismissing it against President Trump is an unsurprising tribute to the poor judgment that led to the indictment against Mr. De Oliveira in the first place,\" John Irving, de Oliveira's lawyer, said in a statement. \"Just because you can doesn't mean you should. If they prefer a slow acquittal, that's fine with us.\"",
      "A lawyer for Nauta declined to comment.",
      "Trump became the first former president to face federal charges when a grand jury returned an indictment against him in June 2023. The prosecution came months after FBI agents conducted a court-authorized search of Trump's South Florida property, Mar-a-Lago, in August 2022 and recovered more than 100 documents marked classified that he kept after his first term ended in January 2021.",
      "Following the search, Trump mounted a separate legal battle that brought the appointment of an independent arbiter to sift through the material seized by the FBI, though the 11th Circuit ordered an end to that review in late 2022.",
      "Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November of that year to take over the federal investigation into Trump's handling of sensitive government records and pursued charges against the president-elect for unlawfully retaining national defense information and attempting to obstruct the Justice Department's probe. Trump was charged alongside two employees, Nauta, an aide, and de Oliveira, the property manager as Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Trump, Nauta and de Oliveira pleaded not guilty to all charges. The president-elect claimed his prosecution was a politically motivated attempt to harm his candidacy in the race for a second term.",
      "Prosecutors used court filings to reveal information about how Trump allegedly stored records containing the nation's secrets at his resort, as well as how he, with his co-defendants, allegedly engaged in a scheme to deceive federal investigators and stymie their probe.",
      "They included photos showing boxes of material stacked on the stage in Mar-a-Lago's ballroom and in a bathroom on the property. Other images taken by the FBI during its August 2022 search show boxes of records in a storage room and in Trump's office, some of which prosecutors said contained highly sensitive information alongside personal keepsakes and other items from his presidency.",
      "Cannon initially set a trial date for May 20, 2024, but she postponed the proceedings weeks before they were set to begin.",
      "The president-elect and his lawyers attempted to have the case against him dismissed on a variety of grounds, claiming he was selectively prosecuted, he was shielded from federal charges by presidential immunity and Smith was appointed in violation of the Constitution.",
      "Trump succeeded in persuading Cannon that the special counsel's appointment and funding for his office were unlawful, and she ordered the case to be dismissed in July.",
      "But Smith appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit. Both he and Trump's lawyers submitted filings with the court presenting their views on Cannon's ruling, though the court had not yet set a date for arguments. It was expected that an eventual decision from the 11th Circuit would wind up before the Supreme Court.",
      "The documents case was one of two that Smith brought against Trump. In Washington, D.C., he faced charges related to an alleged attempt to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election. The president-elect pleaded not guilty to the four counts he faced there, and the dispute landed before the Supreme Court as Trump argued presidential immunity shielded him from prosecution.",

    "story": [
      "A class of drugs known as GLP-1s have been helping people lose weight, but out of pocket costs put them out of reach for many Americans. In West Virginia, a subsidy program for public employees was showing promising results, but then the state abruptly ended it, leaving many searching for new solutions.",
      "One beneficiary was Hilaria Swisher. She has struggled with her weight since she was little, but GLP-1 drugs have recently helped her.",
      "\"That's not me,\" she said, of an old photo of herself. \"I look at that person and who I am now and I don't see me there. And even when this picture was taken, I didn't see me.\"",
      "Weight loss injectables have exploded in popularity, with an estimated 15.5 million Americans reporting using them.",
      "\"In January, when I took my first shot, my official weight was 236.6,\" Swisher told CBS News. \"I'm down to 170.2, so a total of over 27% of my body weight lost.\"",
      "West Virginia has America's highest obesity rate among adults, more than 40%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the second highest rate for GLP-1 prescriptions. But West Virginia is also the country's third poorest state, making the shots wildly unaffordable for many who lack insurance.",
      "In 2020, West Virginia launched a pilot program to subsidize the drugs for public employees. That means teachers, city workers and law enforcement officers were all eligible.",
      "Swisher, who qualified for the program through her husband, has a copay of $25 a month for the drugs. The out-of-pocket cost for GLP-1 drugs can be more than $1,000 per month.",
      "Dr. Laura Davisson, who directs the weight management programs at the West Virginia University Health System and oversaw care for hundreds of patients in the pilot program, told CBS News that GLP-1 drugs are \"absolutely a game-changer.\"",
      "But in March, the state insurance agency funding the West Virginia program announced it was over, saying there was not enough supply and it was too expensive.",
      "It was a painful development for people like Lori Osborne, who had lost 70 pounds and six sizes in her clothes. Now, she says she wouldn't have started using GLP-1 drugs if she'd known she'd be cut off from them in the future.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 17:08:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Susan Lorincz was sentenced to 25 years in prison for shooting Ajike Owens, her Black neighbor, through her front door last year.",
    "story": [
      "A white woman in Florida was sentenced Monday to 25 years in prison\u00a0for fatally shooting her neighbor, a Black mother of four, in a case that sparked outrage and yet another national reckoning over gun violence and racism.",
      "A jury convicted Susan Lorincz, 60, of manslaughter in August for killing Ajike Owens outside of her home in Ocala on June 2, 2023. Owens, who went by the name A.J., was 35. Ocala is a small city located about 80 miles northwest of Orlando.",
      "Lorincz faced a maximum sentence of 30 years imprisonment on the charges originally brought against her after the shooting \u2014 one count of manslaughter with a firearm and one count of assault \u2014 Bill Gladson, the state attorney for Florida's fifth judicial district,\u00a0announced later in June that year. In Florida, the lead prosecutor in each district is called a state attorney.",
      "On Monday, Judge Robert Hodges said Lorincz had ample time to call law enforcement and that there was no real risk that Owens was trying to break into her home. \"The shooting was based, I find, more in anger than in fear,\" Hodges said before the sentencing.",
      "The authorities and prosecutors involved came under scrutiny in the wake of Owens' death, in part because of the choice to charge Lorincz with manslaughter instead of second-degree murder, as well as the fact that Lorincz was not immediately taken into custody after the shooting occurred.",
      "Florida's \"stand your ground\" law, a controversial doctrine adopted in multiple U.S. states that allows individuals to use force in self-defense scenarios, played a role in those decisions. The law has come up in similar cases\u00a0in Missouri and elsewhere in recent years, after first entering mainstream public consciousness in connection with the deadly shooting of Trayvon Martin, a Black teenager, near Miami in 2012.",
      "\"In making the filing decision on this case, my office carefully examined the viability of both second degree murder and manslaughter with a firearm, both first degree felonies,\" Gladson's office said in a statement once Lorincz's charges were revealed. A second-degree murder charge required \"evidence of hatred, spite, ill will or evil intent toward the victim at the time of the killing,\" which the Marion County sheriff's criminal investigation did not sufficiently find, according to the state attorney.",
      "\"As deplorable as the defendant's actions were in this case, there is insufficient evidence to prove this specific and required element of second degree murder,\" that statement continued. It noted charges for second-degree murder and manslaughter with a firearm are both first-degree felonies.",
      "Lorincz shot Owens during an ongoing dispute between them over children in the neighborhood, including Owens' children, apparently playing in the area around Lorincz's residence, according to trial testimony and the arrest affidavit for Lorincz.",
      "Authorities said Owens approached the door of Lorincz's home the day of the shooting to confront her, after learning the older woman had engaged in an argument with the children outside, shouted, and threw a roller skate at one of them.",
      "Owens' 10-year-old son accompanied her to Lorincz's residence, where she knocked on Lorincz's door and demanded she come outside. Lorincz proceeded to fire a .380-caliber handgun through the door, striking Owens in the upper chest. Owens was unresponsive by the time authorities arrived at the scene and later pronounced dead at a hospital.",
      "The door to Lorincz's home was locked when she fired the shot and Owens was unarmed.",
      "Owens' mother, Pamela Dias, told \"CBS Mornings\" the week after her death that her grandson witnessed the shooting and felt guilty he could not save his mother. He was the 10-year-old child hit by the roller skate.",
      "\"I still can't believe this happened,\" Dias said. \"When does a person get shot for knocking on a door?\"",
      "Attorneys for Lorincz claimed throughout her trial that the woman fired her gun in self-defense, the same stance she took in interviews with law enforcement after Owens' death. Lorincz told authorities she feared for her life when Owens approached her home, and just \"fired the gun\" because she felt she was in \"mortal danger,\" according to the arrest affidavit.",
      "She also said a prior altercation with Owens was the reason she purchased the handgun, which Lorincz said she had used only a handful of times at a shooting range, the previous year. Witnesses told law enforcement investigating the shooting that Lorincz was known to harass children in the neighborhood and call them, including Owens' children, horrendous racist slurs. Lorincz admitted to some of those allegations in conversations with detectives but denied she intentionally threw a roller skate at a child before the shooting.",
      "Following a weeklong trial, a jury, which consisted solely of white jurors, according to the Associated Press, found Lorincz guilty of manslaughter with a firearm on Aug. 16.",
      "\"This case is undoubtedly a tragic reminder of the devastating consequences of gun violence. The defendant's choices have left four young children without their mother, a loss that will be felt for the rest of their lives,\" said Gladson, whose assistant attorneys prosecuted the case, in a statement. \"While today's verdict can't bring AJ back, we hope it brings some measure of justice and peace to her family and friends.\"",
      "Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who famously represented the families of Trayvon Martin, George Floyd, and others in high-profile litigation over racial violence, also represented Owens' family in this case. Crump called Lorincz's conviction \"a critical step in securing justice\" for Owens and her family in a separate statement after the verdict came down.",
      "\"We are profoundly grateful that the jury has delivered a guilty verdict in this heartbreaking case. AJ Owens was a devoted mother whose life was tragically cut short, leaving her children, including a young son who witnessed this horrific act, to carry the burden of her loss,\" his statement said. \"While nothing can erase the pain they've endured, today's decision sends a clear message that senseless violence will be met with accountability. We will continue to stand by AJ's family as they heal and fight for a future where no family has to experience such devastating loss.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 15:26:14 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump, who ran on mass deportation and harsher immigration policies, could inherit a border that is relatively quiet.",
    "story": [
      "Unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border are on track to drop to a new low for the Biden administration in November, according to internal Customs and Border Protection figures obtained by CBS News.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol is on pace to record fewer than 50,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border unlawfully this month. The agency has been averaging roughly 1,550 apprehensions between legal border entry points each day so far in November, according to the internal data.",
      "While U.S. officials had been worried about a spike in migrant crossings after President-elect Donald Trump won the presidential election, due to his promises to seal the southern border, that has not materialized \u2014 at least not yet. In fact, illegal border crossings dropped slightly after Election Day.",
      "If the trend holds, illegal border crossings in November will be below the 54,000 apprehensions logged by Border Patrol in September, the current Biden-era low. The last time illegal border crossings were lower was in the summer of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic sharply reduced migration.",
      "Spikes in migrants journeying to the U.S. border have bedeviled Republican and Democratic presidents alike. But migrant apprehensions soared to record highs under Mr. Biden, peaking at 250,000 in December. The Trump-era monthly high was 133,000 in May 2019.",
      "The current four-year-low in illegal immigration reflects a broader decrease that began earlier this year and that has been mainly attributed to efforts by the Mexican government to stop migrants from reaching American soil and asylum restrictions enacted by President Biden in June.",
      "That stringent asylum policy has dramatically cut the number of migrants released into the U.S. and allowed to apply for legal protection, government statistics show.",
      "Trump has vowed to enact even stricter measures, promising to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history and dismantle Biden administration programs that allow certain migrants to enter the country legally. Under one of those policies, the U.S. is currently processing about 40,000 migrants each month at official border crossings after they secure appointments through a smartphone app.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas argued the Biden administration built a new border policy \"model\" that both enforces U.S. law and adheres to the country's values.",
      "\"Through tough measures at our border, newly-built capabilities to remove people more quickly, the construction of lawful pathways that enable people to obtain relief in a safe and orderly way, and an unprecedented attack on the smuggling organizations, we have driven border encounters below their 2019 level, made the border more secure than it was then, and upheld our standing as a country of refuge for those who qualify under the law,\" Mayorkas said.",
      "The \"ultimate irony\"",
      "Trump made the situation at the border under Mr. Biden central to his campaign, and his hardline immigration proposals resonated with many voters. Mass deportation, for example, continues to enjoy support from a majority of Americans, CBS News polling shows. But Trump could very well inherit a border that is relatively quiet.",
      "\"It is an ultimate irony, and it is going to put Trump in a position of declaring victory,\" said Doris Meissner, who led the now-defunct Immigration Naturalization Service during the Clinton administration and currently serves as a senior fellow at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute.",
      "The lull at the border, should it persist, could allow the incoming Trump administration to focus limited immigration enforcement resources in the interior of the country, to carry out the president-elect's mass deportation plan, which faces formidable logistical hurdles.",
      "With roughly 6,000 law enforcement officers and 41,000 detention beds, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch currently lacks the manpower and resources to arrest, detain and deport the millions of unauthorized immigrants Trump and his allies have promised to expel from the country.",
      "Trump's top advisers have floated proposals to tap into the Department of Defense's vast resources, including by using military planes for deportations and tasking National Guard soldiers with carrying out immigration arrests. But the feasibility \u2014 and legality \u2014 of those plans remain open questions.",
      "Meissner said the relative calm at the southern border could allow Trump's administration to redirect Border Patrol resources towards interior immigration enforcement. But she warned that the lull in illegal border crossings could be disrupted if Mexican enforcement eases or if programs that discourage migrants from crossing the border illegally by offering them a legal path to enter the U.S. are terminated.",
      "\"There is a formula right now that even though it's fragile, is working,\" Meissner said. \"The Trump administration is very disruptor oriented, and it could actually find itself having more of a problem than is now the case at the border.\"",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence can help you research travel destinations as well as simplify tasks like making reservations. But can AI also plan a trip or vacation better than you can?",
      "To put AI to the test, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave used\u00a0Google's Gemini bot\u00a0to explore travel options, while CBS News correspondent Nancy Chen, herself a seasoned traveler, relied on more conventional online tools to compare deals across flights, hotels and activities. Here's what they found.",
      "Which approach saved time and money?",
      "For the sake of comparison, both Van Cleave and Chen set out to travel to Las Vegas, Nevada, but they went about planning the trip in different ways.",
      "Using Google's Gemini AI app, Van Cleave spent under a minute on his mobile phone to generate a potential itinerary. For her part, Chen spent about 45 minutes comparing deals and reviews across websites including Expedia, Kayak and Tripadvisor.",
      "The upshot? He saved time, while the total cost of a flight and three nights at a five-star hotel came out to $741.48, compared to $780.05 for the same itinerary rustled up by Chen.",
      "\"I think he won this round, and I really need a vacation now,\" Chen said.",
      "Communication breakdown",
      "Yet while Gemini found some savings, it fell short once the pair was on the ground, and Van Cleave tasked it with creating an itinerary of free activities and events.",
      "\"I am on my way, letting AI guide my day,\" Van Cleave said. The technology directed him to visit the Bellagio Resort & Casino, where it suggested he visit a free botanical garden. But that information appeared to be outdated.",
      "\"What it didn't tell me \u2014 they seasonally tear it down for a holiday display,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Chen, guided by her own internet research, visited the Pinball Hall of Fame, which was open and which displayed hundreds of pinball machines, including vintage games from 1953.",
      "AI also fell short for Van Cleave when it told him that morning fountain shows at the Bellagio are less crowded than those that take place in the afternoon.",
      "\"The reason the morning fountain shows are less crowded is because there are no morning fountain shows,\" Van Cleave said. \"They don't start until three.\"",
      "Van Cleave was misdirected yet again when he arrived at what he expected to be the Mirage, a casino resort, for a volcano show. In its place was a construction site where a new Hard Rock Cafe has yet to open.",
      "More successfully, AI steered Van Cleave to Vegas' art district on Fremont Street, and booked a dinner reservation that was to the correspondents' liking.",
      "To err is human",
      "Not that Chen's search was foolproof. She visited the Stratosphere Tower, the tallest observation tower in the U.S., in hopes of scoring a free ride to its top floor drinks lounge. There was just one hitch.",
      "\"I thought it would be free to go up to the drinks lounge...but turns out it charged admission as well,\" she said.",
      "In the end \u2014 and recognizing the unscientific nature of CBS News' experiment \u2014 AI was a clear winner on speed. But it still appears to require human surveillance to ensure its recommendations are up to date and accurate.",
      "One AI travel tool company, GuideGeek, told CBS News it is 98% accurate, but that it is continually upgrading the tech to better advise users on attractions' business hours and other information. Users are also instructed to give the AI feedback when it provides a faulty recommendation in order to improve the product for other travelers.",
      "Indeed, major travel service providers seem confident that \"generative AI,\" which functions by creating text, videos and other content based on existing data, is here to stay. Expedia, just to name one major travel site, has also launched its own AI travel tool, to provide customers with a range of information, such as the best time to visit certain destinations.",

      "\"President Biden, as far as legacy, has many successes to point to,\" Doggett said. \"But the most important success would have been had he stepped aside a year ago and given us a better chance of preventing Trump from coming back and doing all the damage that he will do to our country.\"",
      "Mr. Biden ran for the White House four years ago in an attempt to end Trumpism, touting his wisdom as an experienced political hand who had spent decades in the U.S. Senate and service for eight years as Barack Obama's vice president. He'll soon leave office at the age of 82, with his White House tenure wedged between Trump's first and second terms as president and a Republican-led Congress riled by Mr. Biden's tenure leading the nation.",
      "\"Jimmy Carter is going to be very happy now that he wasn't the worst president of my lifetime,\" Florida GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez gloated. \"\u2026.[Biden's] policies got pretty soundly defeated in this last election.\"",
      "As Democrats sort through the aftermath of what went wrong, among those in Congress who helped push him out of the 2024 race, there remains respect for what Biden accomplished.",
      "\"For where America was going at the time, he saved our democracy, at least for four years,\" Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley said.",
      "But hindsight has also brought about the belief that acting sooner might have made a difference.",
      "\"[Harris] ran a pretty good campaign, actually a really good campaign, and she had the disadvantages of not having the time to distance herself from Biden,\" California Rep. Scott Peters said. \"Every campaign you make mistakes. And because she had such a compressed time frame, she didn't really have time to recover from the mistakes. But I thought it was certainly better than the alternative. I think if the president had been on the ticket, it would've just been a slaughter.\"",
      "Back in 2019, Biden said he believed history would look back on four years of President Trump \"and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time.\" His campaign carried the implicit hope for Democrats that while Trump may have changed politics for the time being, defeating him would bring back a measure of civility in a nation that increasingly appeared to have long moved past wanting such courtesy.",
      "Now, Trump has found his way back to the White House after trying to overturn his loss in 2020 and spreading falsehoods that the election was stolen, claims that stirred the mob of his supporters who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. 2021 and scarred the normally peaceful transfer of power. He overcame indictments and a group of younger Republican primary challengers. He survived two assassination attempts and won a clear victory this fall, becoming the first man in over a century to be elected to non-consecutive terms as president.",
      "In this last election, many voters sided with a far different vision for America than the one espoused by Mr. Biden. Trump's approach is far more combative, his agenda centered around undocumented immigration and a vow to conduct mass deportations along with moves enticing the far right, like potential pardons for Jan. 6 rioters. He's also promised tariffs and tax changes targeted at Americans' economic concerns.",
      "Before July, Democratic leaders publicly shook off concerns about Mr. Biden's age and ability to win again, choosing instead to overhaul the party's primary process at his own urging, paving the way for him to face little resistance about his decision to run for reelection until after his fateful debate performance.",
      "In his lone White House term, Biden led the nation out of the coronavirus pandemic and worked with Democrats' narrow congressional majorities at the time to pass a $1.9 trillion relief proposal during his first 100 days in office, relying on that same power more than a year later to put in place a landmark plan to fight climate change, both being party-line initiatives praised by Democrats and fiercely opposed by Republicans.",
      "He signed into law major bipartisan bills on infrastructure, gun safety and domestic production of semiconductor computer chips. He helped bolster support for Ukraine as it faces Russia's brutal invasion, work that may soon be undercut given that notable Trump administration picks either haven't been supportive of providing continued assistance to Ukraine or have advocated for a negotiated end to the war.",
      "But inflation troubles drowned out other aspects of Mr. Biden's economic record while the border, immigration, and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan were key issues that Biden's presidency struggled with as he asked Democrats to get behind him for another term.",
      "\"Look, there's going to be a lot of punditry, a lot of election experts who are going to have their opinions, who are going to have their thoughts, but the president is very, very proud,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters after the election. \"Very proud of what he's been able to accomplish and incredibly impressed for what the vice president was able to do.\"",
      "A source familiar with the president's standing at the time said internal campaign polling \"showed a slight hit\" from the June 27 debate and contended that \"it wasn't until the circular firing squad picked up and there was regular coverage of Democrats calling for an exit that we really took more damage.\"",
      "Yet among the Democrats who called on him to leave the race before Mr. Biden dropped out on July 21, there is a sense that they were right, that they did what needed to be done even if it didn't get them where they wanted to be.",
      "\"In retrospect, I feel certain that Biden was facing certain defeat and that we were certainly going to see the loss of the House and the Senate, and I felt the House would be much worse than it is now,\" said California Democratic Rep. Mark Takano, who still regards Biden as having had an \"amazing run as the president.\"",
      "Others didn't share the same introspection.",
      "Even after going public with his call for Biden to end his campaign, Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown lost his own contest, a defeat which helped give Republicans the Senate and unified control of Washington. Reeling from his loss and facing reporters as he hurried through the Capitol a few days after the election, Brown said \"I don't have any thoughts on Biden's legacy.\"",
      "\"I'm just focused on what we need to do here these last few weeks,\" Brown said. \"I'm not a pundit.\"",
      "And the man who defeated Brown didn't hesitate to credit Mr. Biden for helping bring Trump back to power.",
      "\"Biden was the greatest thing to ever happen to President Trump because he showed the country how insane the left has gotten,\" said Bernie Moreno, the Republican who ousted Brown from his Senate seat.",
      "Mr. Biden isn't quite an afterthought in Washington \u2014 however, the spotlight that was so squarely trained on him for most of the last four years has drifted to Trump and the vision his allies on the right have for the president-elect's return to power.",
      "In these waning days of his presidency, Mr. Biden isn't the only one quietly finishing his tenure. Political life in the nation's Capitol rarely ends in climactic fashion, with most leaving the halls of power because of retirement or defeat rather than one final victory before calling it a career.",
      "Like Mr. Biden, Republican Utah Sen. Mitt Romney is a former party standard bearer. And like the president, his political career is coming to an end as a man they both opposed prepares to retake the White House, that \"aberrant moment\" Mr. Biden once described returning for an encore.",
      "\"President Biden is a good and fine man,\" Romney said. \"But I think he badly misread the American public.\"",

The book has sold more than 30 million copies and was the basis of a 1984 television miniseries starring Jenny Seagrove as a young Emma and Deborah Kerr as Emma late in life.",
      "\"And if you want to meet the real Emma, meet me,\" Bradford told the Telegraph of London in 2009. \"Emma had to be tough and ruthless at times: but then so am I. I have to be, as a businesswoman. And I'm a bloody good businesswoman.\"",
      "Bradford and Emma Harte were linked by more than money: both had family secrets. As a young woman, Emma became pregnant by a man who refused to marry her and gave birth to a daughter. Years later, Bradford learned through her biographer that her own mother had been born out of wedlock. It is now believed that Bradford's maternal grandfather was Frederick Oliver Robinson, the second Marquess of Ripon and owner of the Studley Royal estate in Yorkshire, which is now a World Heritage Site.",
      "Seagrove, who became friends with Bradford after starring in the miniseries, described her as a \"powerhouse of glamour and warmth\" and a \"force of nature\" who stayed true to her roots.",
      "\"Success never diluted her warmth and humor or her ability to relate to everyone she met, whether a cleaner or a princess,\" Seagrove said. \"She never, ever forgot that she was just a girl from Yorkshire that worked hard and made good. RIP dear friend.\"",
      "Bradford had a strict writing routine: at work behind her IBM Lexmark typewriter by 6 a.m., break around 1 p.m., then back to writing until 6 p.m., at the latest. According to an authorized 2006 biography, Piers Dudgeon's \"The Woman of Substance,\" Bradford more than adapted to her midlife fortune, living in a 5,300 square foot apartment overlooking Manhattan's East River, collecting Impressionist art and enjoying refills of pink champagne poured by her Moroccan butler. When the Bradfords put their apartment up for sale in 2010, the asking price was just under $19 million. (They sold it to Uma Thurman in 2013 for $10 million).",
      "Over the years, she met many other celebrities. Bradford befriended Sean Connery before he appeared in his first James Bond movie and remembered advising him, thankfully in vain, that he should lose his Scottish accent if he wanted to succeed.",
      "Around the same time, she met a fellow journalist at the Yorkshire Evening Post. He was \"lanky and disheveled with acne,\" and kept trying to talk to her even after she turned him down for a date at the movies.",
      "He was Peter O'Toole.",
      "\"Years later, (Evening Post editor) Keith Waterhouse and I were at an event where the producer Sam Spiegel introduced the star of his new movie,\" she told The Guardian in 2021. \"Out walked the most beautiful man I'd ever seen, dressed as Lawrence of Arabia. Keith said: 'Don't you wish you'd gone to the pictures with him now?' I never got over Peter's transformation.\"",
      "According to the obituary on her website, when Bradford was recently asked what would be on her epitaph, she replied: \"She made her dreams come true.\"",
      "According to the obituary, Bradford will be laid to rest alongside her husband at Westchester Hills Cemetery, New York following a private funeral at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue.",

The agency praised as \"incredible\" the efforts made by hundreds of people to help save the foundering pod.",
      "\"It's amazing to witness the genuine care and compassion people have shown toward these magnificent animals,\" Joel Lauterbach, a Department of Conservation spokesperson, said in a statement. \"This response demonstrates the deep connection we all share with our marine environment.\"",

A pilot whale's typical lifespan is anywhere from 35 to 60 years, although their survival is threatened by several factors including chemical contaminants, disease, entanglement in fishing gear and ocean noise.

    "story": [
      "Vilnius, Lithuania \u2014 A DHL cargo plane crashed early Monday near the airport in Lithuania's capital, killing one person, authorities said as they searched for clues to what caused the tragedy. Lithuanian officials, who in the past weeks have been investigating incendiary devices allegedly sent on Western-bound cargo planes, stopped short of linking the crash with that investigation.",

      "The pre-dawn strikes, which destroyed an eight-story building and left a crater in the ground, were the fourth in Beirut in less than a week.

The warning, posted on X, told people to evacuate at least 500 meters away.",
      "The army said that over the past day it had conducted intelligence-based strikes on Hezbollah targets in Dahiyeh, in Beirut's southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. It said it hit several command centers and weapons storage facilities.",
      "Also Saturday, a drone strike killed two people and injured three in the southern Lebanese port city of Tyre, according to the Lebanese state-run National News Agency.

      "United Nations climate talks adopted a deal to inject at least $300 billion annually in humanity's fight against climate change, aimed at helping developing nations cope with the ravages of global warming in tense negotiations.",
      "The $300 billion will go to developing countries who need the cash to wean themselves off the coal, oil and gas that causes the globe to overheat, adapt to future warming and pay for the damage caused by climate change's extreme weather. It's not near the full amount of $1.3 trillion that developing countries were asking for, but it's three times a deal of $100 billion a year from 2009 that is expiring. Some delegations said this deal is headed in the right direction, with hopes that more money flows in the future.",
      "But it was not quite the agreement by consensus that these meetings usually operate with and some developing nations were livid about being ignored.",
      "COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev gaveled the deal into acceptance before any nation had a chance to speak. When they did they blasted him for being unfair to them, the deal for not being enough and the world's rich nations for being too stingy.",
      "However, Chandni Raina, a representative for India's COP 29 delegation, slammed the deal.",
      "\"We are disappointed in the outcome which clearly brings out the unwillingness of the developed country parties to fulfil their responsibilities,\" said Raina, according to Reuters.",
      "She called it \"nothing more than an optical illusion,\" saying it \"will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face. Therefore, we oppose the adoption of this document.\"",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres   also indicated in a social media post disappointment in the outcome, saying that he \"had hoped for a more ambitious outcome, on both finance and mitigation, to meet the great challenge we face.\"",
      "He said the agreement is a \"base on which to build. It must be honored in full and on time. Commitments must quickly become cash.\"",
      "In a statement, President Biden called the deal a \"historic outcome,\" saying it \"will help mobilize the level of finance \u2013 from all sources \u2013 that developing countries need to accelerate the transition to clean, sustainable economies, while opening up new markets for American-made electric vehicles, batteries, and other products.\"",
      "He added that \"in the years ahead, we are confident that the United States will continue this work...While some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that's underway in America and around the world, nobody can reverse it \u2014 nobody.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has said he will, for a second time, exit the\u00a0Paris Agreement, which was signed in in 2016 and seeks to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The world is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius and carbon emissions keep rising.  The U.S. formally\u00a0withdrew\u00a0during Trump's first term, but then\u00a0rejoined under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, a long line of nations agreed with India and piled on, with Nigeria's Nkiruka Maduekwe, CEO of the National Council on Climate Change, calling the deal an insult and a joke.",
      "\"I'm disappointed. It's definitely below the benchmark that we have been fighting for for so long,\" said Juan Carlos Monterrey, of the Panama delegation. He noted that a few changes, including the inclusion of the words \"at least\" before the number $300 billion and an opportunity for revision by 2030, helped push them to the finish line.",
      "\"Our heart goes out to all those nations that feel like they were walked over,\" he said.",
      "The final package pushed through \"does not speak or reflect or inspire confidence,\" India's Raina said.",
      "\"We absolutely object to the unfair means followed for adoption,\" Raina said. \"We are extremely hurt by this action by the president and the secretariat.\"",
      "Speaking for nearly 50 of the poorest nations of the world, Evans Davie Njewa of Malawi was more mild, expressing what he called reservations with the deal. And the Alliance of Small Island States' Cedric Schuster said he had more hope \"that the process would protect the interests of the most vulnerable\" but nevertheless expressed tempered support for the deal.",
      "There were somewhat satisfied parties, with European Union's Wopke Hoekstra calling it a new era of climate funding, working hard to help the most vulnerable. But activists in the plenary hall could be heard coughing over Hoekstra's speech in an attempt to disrupt it.",
      "Eamon Ryan, Ireland's environment minister, called the agreement \"a huge relief.\"",
      "\"It was not certain. This was tough,\" he said. \"Because it's a time of division, of war, of (a) multilateral system having real difficulties, the fact that we could get it through in these difficult circumstances is really important.\"",
      "U.N. Climate Change's Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called the deal an \"insurance policy for humanity,\" adding that like insurance, \"it only works if the premiums are paid in full, and on time.\"",
      "The deal is seen as a step toward helping countries on the receiving end create more ambitious targets to limit or cut emissions of heat-trapping gases that are due early next year. It's part of the plan to keep cutting pollution with new targets every five years, which the world agreed to at the U.N. talks in Paris in 2015.",
      "Countries also anticipate that this deal will send signals that help drive funding from other sources, like multilateral development banks and private sources. That was always part of the discussion at these talks \u2014 rich countries didn't think it was realistic to only rely on public funding sources \u2014 but poor countries worried that if the money came in loans instead of grants, it would send them sliding further backward into debt that they already struggle with.",
      "\"The $300 billion goal is not enough, but is an important down payment toward a safer, more equitable future,\" said World Resources Institute President Ani Dasgupta. \"This deal gets us off the starting block. Now the race is on to raise much more climate finance from a range of public and private sources, putting the whole financial system to work behind developing countries' transitions.\"",
      "And even though it's far from the needed $1.3 trillion, it's more than the $250 billion that was on the table in an earlier draft of the text, which outraged many countries and led to a period of frustration and stalling over the final hours of the summit.",

      "Sociologist Emiliana De Blasio, of Rome's LUISS University, told CBS Saturday Morning that for Italians, time spent cooking is akin to \"religion.\" It also provides a way for families and loved ones to gather. With more and more women joining the workforce and a the desire for good, home-cooked meals lingering, male identity in the nation is \"changing,\" according to De Blasio.",

      "Meanwhile, another student, Riccardo, does the bulk of the cooking at the home he shares with his fianc\u00e9e, Chiara. She works late, so he cooks. He likes the time spent preparing a meal \u2014 and the look on his fianc\u00e9e's face when she comes home to a prepared table.",

      "Her latest tirade was set off by the decision by House members allied with Romualdez and Marcos to detain her chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, who was accused of hampering a congressional inquiry into the possible misuse of her budget as vice president and education secretary. Lopez was later transferred to a hospital after falling ill and wept when she heard of a plan to temporarily lock her up in a women's prison.",

I said 'if I'm killed, you'll kill BBM, Liza Araneta and Martin Romualdez. No joke, no joke,'\" the vice president said without elaborating and using the initials that many use to call the president.",
      "\"I've given my order, 'If I die, don't stop until you've killed them.' And he said, 'yes,'\" the vice president said.",
      "Under the Philippine penal code, such public remarks may constitute a crime of threatening to inflict a wrong on a person or his family and is punishable by a jail term and fine.",
      "Amid the political divisions, military chief Gen. Romeo Brawner issued a statement with an assurance that the 160,000-member Armed Forces of the Philippines would remain nonpartisan \"with utmost respect for our democratic institutions and civilian authority.\"",

I mean, I've only been in office for three years,\" Carey said. \"I was in the private sector before that. So I'm not a career politician. But the opportunity to serve the state that I love, you know, I grew up in Cincinnati and Sabina and served in the military up at Camp Perry. My family's from Cleveland and spent my career in Appalachia. So there's nobody that knows the state any better than me.

Flutter makes it easier for app developers to design their software, but its unique structure also helps hackers hide their malicious code, making it harder for experts to detect.",
      "Once installed, the malware connects to a remote server (think of it as a command center for hackers) to receive instructions. These instructions could include running commands on your computer without your knowledge. One trick this malware uses is running AppleScripts, a type of script built for macOS systems, which can quietly execute commands to steal your data or even control your device.",

      "North Korea has a history of using cyberattacks to fund its operations or disrupt systems worldwide, often targeting financial systems or vulnerable individuals. In this case, the malware seems to be in the testing phase, potentially laying the groundwork for a larger attack in the future.",
      "The apps containing the malware were designed to look harmless. These tactics suggest a focus on tricking people through social engineering, a method North Korean hackers have used in the past.",
      "By embedding the malware within apps that appear useful or fun, the attackers can increase the chances of someone downloading and using the infected software. While this particular malware has not yet been linked to active attacks, its connection to North Korea\u2019s cyber playbook is a strong indicator of potential risks ahead.",

      "1) Use reliable antivirus software:\u00a0A strong antivirus program is your first line of defense against malicious links and malware that could steal your private information. Avoid clicking on random links, especially in emails or messages that claim to be urgent or demand updates. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. It can also warn you about phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping to keep your personal data and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Be careful with downloads and links:\u00a0Only download apps from trusted sources like the Mac App Store or official websites of known developers. Hackers often disguise malware as legitimate updates or harmless apps.",
      "3) Keep your software up to date:\u00a0Regular updates for macOS and installed apps are essential because they patch security flaws. Apple frequently rolls out updates to address vulnerabilities, so enabling automatic updates ensures you stay protected without the hassle of manually checking for them.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0A strong password can help keep your Mac safe from unauthorized access. Avoid reusing passwords across different accounts. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here\u2014it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2024 here.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Activate\u00a02FA for key accounts like your Apple ID, email, and financial services. This adds a second layer of security, making it much harder for attackers to access your accounts\u2014even if they have your password.",

It just shows that no device is completely safe, not even one made by Apple. Hackers, including those backed by North Korea, are constantly finding new ways to trick users into downloading malicious software. These attacks often fly under the radar because they look like regular, safe apps. With these threats becoming more sophisticated, it\u2019s more important than ever to stay aware of the risks and be cautious about what you download and click on.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A Stanford University \"misinformation expert\" has been accused of using artificial intelligence (AI) to craft testimony later used by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in a politically-charged case.",
      "Jeff Hancock, a professor of communications and founder of the vaunted school's Social Media Lab, provided an expert declaration in a case involving a satirical conservative YouTuber named Christopher Kohls. The court case is about Minnesota's recent ban on political\u00a0deepfakes, which the plaintiffs argue is an attack on free speech.",
      "Hancock's testimony was submitted to the court by Ellison, who is arguing in favor of the law. Hancock is \"well-known for his research on how people use deception with technology, from sending texts and emails to detecting fake online reviews,\" according to Stanford's website.",

      "\"[The] Declaration of Prof. Jeff Hancock cites a study that does not exist,\" lawyers argued in a recent 36-page memo. \"No article by the title exists.\"",
      "The \"study\" was called \"The Influence of Deepfake Videos on Political Attitudes and Behavior\" and was purportedly published in the Journal of Information Technology & Politics. The Nov. 16 filing notes that the journal is authentic, but had never published a study by that name.",
      "\"The publication exists, but the cited pages belong to unrelated articles,\" the lawyers argued. \"Likely, the study was a \u2018hallucination\u2019 generated by an AI large language model like ChatGPT.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs do not know how this hallucination wound up in Hancock\u2019s declaration, but it calls the entire document into question, especially when much of the commentary contains no methodology or analytic logic whatsoever.\"",
      "The document also calls out Ellison, arguing that \"the conclusions that Ellison most relies on have no methodology behind them and consist entirely of expert say-so.\"",
      "\"Hancock could have cited a real study similar to the proposition in paragraph 21,\" the memo states. \"But the existence of a fictional citation Hancock (or his assistants) didn\u2019t even bother to click calls into question the quality and veracity of the entire declaration.\"",

      "\"The title of the alleged article, and even a snippet of it, does not appear on anywhere on the internet as indexed by Google and Bing, the most commonly-used search engines,\" the document states. \"Searching Google Scholar, a specialized search engine for academic papers and patent publications, reveals no articles matching the description of the citation authored by \u2018Hwang\u2019 [the purported author] that includes the term \u2018deepfake.\u2019\"",
      "\"Perhaps this was simply a copy-paste error? It\u2019s not,\" the filing later flatly states. \"The article doesn\u2019t exist.\"",
      "The attorneys concluded that, if the declaration were partially fabricated, it is entirely unreliable and should be dismissed from court consideration.",
      "\"The declaration of Prof. Hancock should be excluded in its entirety because at least some of it is based on fabricated material likely generated by an AI model, which calls into question its conclusory assertions,\" the document concluded. \"The court may inquire into the source of the fabrication and additional action may be warranted.\"",

      "Benefits of privacy-focused email services",
      "Secure email providers offer several advantages over their free counterparts. One of the most significant benefits is enhanced encryption, which provides better protection for your communications. Unlike many free services that collect and sell user data to third parties, privacy-focused providers do not engage in such practices. They offer an ad-free experience and give you greater control over your personal information. This means that when you choose a secure email service, you are investing in a platform that prioritizes your privacy and security.",

      "Switching to a secure email service involves several steps that can enhance your online security. First, you should research and choose a provider that meets your needs by comparing features, pricing and user reviews. Once you have made your selection, create an account with your chosen service; many offer a free tier to get started. After setting up your account, it is essential to enable encryption by following the provider's instructions.",
      "Next, you can import any existing emails from your old account using the provider's import tool. Informing your contacts about your new email address is also important to ensure seamless communication moving forward. To further enhance security, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on your new account to add an extra layer of protection. Finally, take some time to familiarize yourself with the new interface and features offered by your secure email service.",

      "The value of investing in privacy",
      "While paying for an email service might seem unnecessary at first glance, it is an investment in your privacy and security that can yield significant benefits over time. By choosing a subscription-based model, you support the development of privacy-focused technologies that prioritize user interests over advertising revenue.

      "It\u2019s the perfect time to pick up holiday gifts for your family and treat yourself to that pricey watch you wouldn\u2019t splurge on otherwise.",
      "Black Friday is a worldwide cultural and economic phenomenon today. It comes with much anticipation, great discounts and a shopping frenzy. Its success is such that it now lasts the whole month. But don\u2019t let the excitement cloud your judgment.",

      "The devil\u2019s in the privacy policy",
      "Particularly when it comes to online shopping, we give up personal data with every purchase. Information such as your email address, name and address is necessary to create an account or receive a delivery. And that\u2019s fine as long as it\u2019s used for these purposes only.",
      "However, the fine print linked under \"Privacy Policy\" that you agree to at checkout often comes with a long list or, worse still, an unspecified number of third parties with which your data will be shared. Retailers often sell personal information and purchase histories to third parties, such as marketing companies and data brokers, who use it to build detailed consumer profiles. Once it\u2019s out there, it\u2019s very hard to remove your information from these third-party databases.",
      "Arguably, this happens all the time, Black Friday or not. But with all the marketing strategies pushing us to buy quickly and buy more, we\u2019re just less likely to pay attention.",

      "The term \"Black Friday\" was originally coined in the 1950s by Philadelphia police officers to describe the chaos that ensued the day after Thanksgiving, when hordes of shoppers and tourists flooded the city.",
      "After the shopping extravaganza of Black Friday, your inbox and phone may experience their own dark moments. A surge in spam is widely reported during the month of November. This unwanted communication can come from several sources.",
      "First, from the online shops where you\u2019ve left your email and phone number. Second, from all the companies that received your consumer profile, the ones listed (or not) in the fine print of the privacy policy. Third, from all the retailers you bought from in the past, including that one-time purchase of a kettlebell set three years ago (that you\u2019d rather forget).",
      "But that\u2019s not all; Black Friday is a fiesta for hackers, too, and the perfect time for social engineering attacks! The urgency and excitement of Black Friday deals encourage you to let your guard down. You\u2019re likelier to click on links or open attachments without checking the source. And less likely to notice that a phishing email pretending to be sent by a big retailer has sneaked into your inbox. Your data is being collected, shared and sold as you read this article.",

Depending on where you live, these options may simply not be available to you.",
      "An easier solution is to use a\u00a0disposable email address whenever you open an account for the sole purpose of making a purchase. Once you receive your order confirmation, you can disable it so that no further communication is sent your way. You can also use privacy-focused tools or browsers that block tracking cookies and prevent companies from collecting your data.",

      "As the dust settles from the shopping rush, it's crucial to be proactive; here are eight essential tips to help you protect your email and personal information from the surge of spam and scams that often follow.",
      "1. Create alias email addresses.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address. An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of best secure and private email services here.",
      "2. Use a\u00a0password manager to consistently use complex passwords that you can change frequently.",
      "3. Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from emails unless you are sure they are from a trusted source. Scammers or hackers can easily change the name of the sender to make it look like it came from a legitimate organization such as Amazon or an individual.\u00a0 But if you click the email header, you will see the sender's actual email address. By pretending to be a reputable organization, the crooks send urgent messages to make you click on links, reply or provide personal information in an attempt to fix a problem or claim a reward. If you click on a malicious link, then a scammer may be able to access your email and other personal data.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software on all your devices:\u00a0The best way to protect yourself from having your data breached is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. Having good antivirus software actively running on your devices will alert you of any malware in your system, warn you against clicking on any malicious links in phishing emails, and ultimately protect you from being hacked.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Malicious links are often disguised as legitimate ones, but they can download malware onto your device without your knowledge. Malware is a type of software that can damage your device, steal your personal information, or give hackers access to your data. Hackers can then use your data for various purposes, such as\u00a0identity theft, fraud or blackmail. This is why it is important to have antivirus software that can detect and remove malware before it causes any harm.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Go directly to the official site where you have any accounts, such as your financial institution, to check if any changes or charges were made instead of clicking links in the email you received or responding to the email. This way, you can avoid falling for phishing scams and keep your account secure.",
      "6. Limit the number of accounts or profiles you create with your personal email account.",
      "7.\u00a0Regularly scrub your personal information on the internet. You don\u2019t want spammers to take your email and add it to their lists, do you? That would result in annoying and potentially dangerous messages flooding your inbox. To prevent that, you need to make sure your personal information is not exposed on the internet. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "8. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0See my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "I've been scammed! What to do next?",
      "If a scammer gets hold of your email address, they can use it to access your other accounts, send phishing emails to trick you into revealing your passwords or personal details, or even impersonate you to commit fraud or other crimes. This is why it is important to protect your email address from falling into the wrong hands and to act quickly if you suspect that it has been compromised. Below are some next steps if you find you or your loved one is a victim of identity theft.",
      "1. If you can regain control of your accounts,\u00a0change your passwords and inform the account provider.",
      "2. Look through bank statements and checking account transactions to see where outlier activity started.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Use\u00a0identity theft protection services to manage your personal information on and offline. Identity Theft protection companies can monitor personal information like your home title, Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using identity theft protections services is that it can include identity theft insurance of up to\u00a0$1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager\u00a0helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4.\u00a0Report any breaches to official government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "5. You may wish to get the professional advice of a lawyer\u00a0before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theft, and if being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing.",
      "6.\u00a0Alert all three major credit bureaus and possibly place a fraud alert on your credit report.",
      "7. Run your own background check or request a copy of one if that is how you discovered your information has been used by a criminal.",
      "If you are a victim of identity theft, the most important thing to do is to take immediate action to mitigate the damage and prevent further harm.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Navigating the world of online shopping during Black Friday can be a thrilling yet daunting experience. While the discounts are enticing, they often come with hidden costs \u2014 namely, your personal data. As you prepare your shopping list, consider utilizing tools to safeguard your information. These resources can help you maintain your privacy while enjoying the benefits of online shopping. Also, remember that post-Black Friday, you may find yourself inundated with spam and unwanted communications from retailers and third parties. Taking proactive steps now can save you from future headaches.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:00:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Porch pirates are on the prowl this holiday season. Tech guru Kurt &quot;CyberGuy&quot; Knutsson has a number of tips to prevent holiday package thefts.",
    "story": [
      "The busy holiday shopping season is just around the corner and most of us will be targeted by an AI scam.",
      "As the holiday season approaches, the excitement of gift-giving can quickly turn into anxiety over package theft. With porch pirates on the prowl, your carefully delivered gifts can vanish right from your doorstep. In 2023 alone, a staggering\u00a0119 million packages were reported stolen, meaning one in every 180 deliveries disappeared into thin air.",
      "Cities like Seattle, Memphis and San Diego have become hot spots for these unfortunate heists.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever found yourself racing home to rescue a package, asking neighbors to keep an eye out or, worst of all, falling victim to these sneaky thieves, you\u2019re not alone. But don\u2019t worry! We\u2019ve got some tips that could save you from the holiday headache of package theft. Let\u2019s dive in.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "Alleged porch pirate taking packages from property (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 1: Get security cameras",
      "First things first, consider installing security cameras around your home. Having a good camera system can really make a difference when it comes to deterring those sneaky thieves. Depending upon how well your police department responds to porch pirate package theft, position your\u00a0video doorbell to capture the face of the pirate and your package deliveries. A Video Doorbell can push notifications to get a phone alert whenever anyone or anything approaches your door, even if they don't ring the doorbell.",
      "Also, you might want to consider adding a couple of nearly invisible\u00a0wireless cameras on tree limbs near the street at your house. We did it in hopes of being able to record a license plate if ever needed for police. I can set them to send a notification when the camera detects a person or car.",
      "When you\u2019re shopping for cameras, look for high-resolution video so you can see everything clearly, even at night, with night vision capabilities. Motion detection is a must. It\u2019ll alert you if someone gets too close to your front door. Plus, two-way audio lets you talk to anyone at your door, whether it\u2019s a delivery person or someone who shouldn\u2019t be there. And don\u2019t forget about cloud storage. This way, you can easily access footage whenever you need it. Check out my top picks for the\u00a0six best outdoor security cameras.",
      "Pro tip: If your camera has the feature, set your video camera to notify you when it identifies packages within view.",
      "GET MORE OF MY TOP PICKS TO AMP UP YOUR HOME SECURITY",
      "Image of a doorbell camera (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 2: Use tracking apps",
      "Next up, make sure you're using tracking apps for your deliveries. Most shipping companies offer tracking services that let you follow your package from the moment it leaves the warehouse until it arrives at your home.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "If you sign up for\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery, you\u2019ll get digital previews of what\u2019s coming to your mailbox, which is super handy. You can set up email or text alerts for delivery updates so you\u2019re always in the loop about when your packages are arriving. Some retailers even send you photos once your package has been delivered, giving you extra reassurance that it made it safely.",
      "A woman using a tracking app on her iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST BLACK FRIDAY LAPTOP DEALS",
      "Tip 3: Make sure someone is home",
      "Now, let\u2019s talk about timing. It\u2019s important to have someone around to receive packages as soon as they arrive. This can be tricky since many deliveries happen during work hours. If you can swing it, try working from home on days when important packages are expected. If that\u2019s not possible, coordinate with friends, family members or roommates so someone is always there to grab\u00a0the delivery right away.",

      "A woman receiving packages at home (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST HOME SECURITY SYSTEMS",
      "Tip 4: Coordinate with your neighbors",
      "Don\u2019t underestimate the power of community. Teaming up with your neighbors can be a game-changer in preventing package theft. Sign up for neighborhood porch pirate alerts from popular local networks like\u00a0Neighbors and\u00a0Nextdoor apps. This is where people often post when they've had a package stolen and sometimes upload videos or images of the suspected porch pirates. Plus, making an agreement with trusted neighbors to watch each other\u2019s packages can really enhance security; there's strength in numbers.",
      "A person picking up packages for their neighbor (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST BLACK FRIDAY PRINTER DEALS",
      "Tip 5: Have the package delivered somewhere else",
      "If home delivery feels too risky, consider alternative delivery options that offer more security. Many people choose to have their packages sent to their workplace if allowed; this way, they\u2019re less likely to be stolen than sitting on a porch all day. Retailers often provide secure pickup points where you can collect your packages at your convenience. Renting a P.O. Box or using services that hold packages for pickup at local shipping facilities are also great options for those valuable items.",
      "KURT\u2019S UNBEATABLE BEST BLACK FRIDAY DEALS",
      "A woman receiving packages at her workplace (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 6: Request a signature confirmation",
      "Another way to prevent package theft is to request a signature confirmation for your deliveries. This means that the delivery person will not leave the package at your door unless someone signs for it. You can request a signature confirmation from most delivery services, such as FedEx, UPS, USPS and DHL. This option may cost extra, but it can give you peace of mind that your package will not be stolen.",
      "Tip 7: Send to remote pick-up locations",
      "Did you know that most delivery services now offer remote pick-up locations? These can be secure lockers, post offices or retail counters. Amazon has hundreds of Amazon Lockers and pick-up counters across the country, which are free for Prime members.\u00a0See how\u00a0far away the nearest Amazon Locker is located from your home.",
      "When you're checking out, just click on\u00a0Change next to your shipping address, then select\u00a0Find a pickup location near you to see your options. Once your package is delivered, you'll get a notification or email with a code to retrieve it from the locker or pick-up point. Some items can even be returned at these locations.",
      "A person picking up a package from a locker (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 8: Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery",
      "We added a strong deadbolt to the door leading into the house from the garage before signing up. Now, when we are not home, an Amazon delivery can be placed securely inside our garage using the free service called Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery. The addition of a\u00a0smart garage controller is the first step. Once you've signed up for Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery, pick Key Delivery when checking out on Amazon to have your packages securely put in the garage. I really like that you can block access to your garage any time you want. The driver never needs your garage code, and access only works for their one-time delivery.",
      "A delivery being made using Amazon Key-In-Garage Delivery (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 9: Provide a delivery box",
      "Another great option is to invest in a\u00a0delivery box that allows packages to be securely dropped off and stored discreetly. Just remember that you'll need to inform delivery personnel about using the box and how it works.",
      "Package being placed in a delivery box (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 10: Sign up for delivery notifications",
      "You can get an alert each time a package arrives at your doorstep.\u00a0Both FedEx and UPS will send a text when you've just received a delivery.\u00a0Amazon will also send you a shipment text letting you know a package has just been delivered.",
      "To set up\u00a0Amazon delivery notifications, follow these quick steps.",

      "Red imported fire ants may be small, but their impact is anything but trivial.

      "A browser is one of the most popular apps we use. It's the gateway between the internet and its users, translating raw code into something we perceive as a web page and allowing us to interact with the web. It's safe to say that anyone who uses the internet uses a web browser.",
      "But while this tool is extremely useful, it can also be equally dangerous. For example, clicking malicious links can redirect you to harmful websites that either steal personal information or infect your device with malware.",
      "If you use a search engine like Google through Chrome, it can collect data on your searches, browsing history and even your location (if location services are enabled).

      "Browsers are much more than simple tools to navigate the web. They are, in many ways, tools for surveillance. While they help you access websites and services, they also track your every move online to feed the ever-hungry advertising industry.",
      "First off, most browsers collect data about your searches, browsing habits and even your location. This data isn't just stored to \"improve your experience,\" it's used to create a detailed profile of you, which is then shared with advertisers who target you with personalized ads.",
      "Google Chrome, for example, is notorious for tracking your activity. As you browse, it feeds data to Google\u2019s advertising engine, allowing it to serve highly targeted ads based on your behavior. This includes everything from your search history to the websites you visit, even down to the smallest detail, like how long you stay on a page\u200b.",
      "\"Google may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties,\" Google boldly\u00a0mentions on its privacy policy page.",
      "Browsers also use cookies to keep tabs on you. These cookies track your activity across different sites, even after you've left a site. This means that ads you saw on one website might follow you across others, creating a persistent digital footprint.

Google then used that data to track web traffic and sell ads.",

While Google Chrome is widely used, it tracks significant amounts of user information to power targeted advertising.

Tools like Incognito mode or cookie-blocking can help a bit, but they\u2019re not enough to truly protect you. If you\u2019re serious about staying private and secure, you need to up your game. Use a VPN, be cautious about what you click on and stay informed about the ways your browser might be working against you.",

      "The 'CyberGuy' walks you through which settings to adjust.",
      "With Apple rolling out the latest iOS 18.1 update, privacy has become an even hotter topic. The update introduces advanced AI capabilities through Apple Intelligence and Siri, giving your device more autonomy in understanding and learning from your behaviors.",

      "iOS 18.1 brings a slew of AI-powered features aimed at enhancing your experience with Siri and Apple Intelligence, but it\u2019s worth questioning: How much does your iPhone really need to know about you? If you're like most people, privacy is a top priority, especially when it comes to sensitive data such as banking information, health details and your location.",
      "When Apple Intelligence is enabled, it starts \"learning\" from your interactions with certain apps, creating a digital profile that can theoretically tailor your experience. This is a double-edged sword; while personalization might sound appealing, it\u2019s crucial to consider what data Apple\u2019s AI is learning and why you might want to limit its reach.",

This customization is entirely up to you, but it\u2019s essential to know where these toggles are and what each does.",
      "Why you should revisit these settings regularly",
      "One thing about privacy settings is that they can change with each software update. As Apple introduces more features, some apps may automatically gain access to Apple Intelligence. It\u2019s essential to check these settings periodically to ensure that no new permissions have been granted without your knowledge.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The arrival of iOS 18.1 is exciting, especially with the enhanced AI features, but it\u2019s crucial to stay vigilant about your privacy. Banking, health and location apps contain some of your most sensitive data, and allowing Apple Intelligence to learn from them might open up unintended risks. By turning off \"Learn from this App\" in settings, you\u2019re taking a proactive step to control your personal information. Remember, gray is off, green is on, and when it comes to privacy, sometimes it\u2019s best to err on the side of caution.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump on Monday said his incoming administration would slap new tariffs on imported goods from Mexico, Canada and China, solidifying a key campaign promise that could have a major impact on trade.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he plans to impose a 25% tariff on products imported from Mexico and Canada, framing the proposal as a response to the ongoing fentanyl crisis.",
      "\"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\" Trump wrote. \"This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\"",
      "Trump said that he would also seek to impose additional tariffs on China.",
      "\"I have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States \u2014 But to no avail,\"  Trump wrote. \"Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America.\"",
      "Mexico and Canada are the United States\u2019 top two trading partners, accounting for nearly 30% of trade volumes. The vehicle manufacturing industry, dairy, paper products, and building supplies like wood are just some of the products that would face disruptions.",
      "Embassies for Canada, China and Mexico did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday night.",
      "The U.S. and China\u00a0held high-level talks\u00a0this year about the fentanyl crisis in an effort to resume counternarcotics cooperation after President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping\u00a0met in California last year. Biden also announced he would increase the tariff rate on various goods from China, saying in May that he would increase the tariffs on electric vehicles from 25% to 100% this year.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump declared he would impose 20% blanket tariff on all imports, and add tariffs of\u00a0at least 60%\u00a0to Chinese products.",
      "During a presidential debate with then-Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, who called Trump's tariffs a \"sales tax on the American people,\" Trump cast the proposed tariffs as a kind of payback.",
      "Any proposed tariffs are likely to receive some pushback from businesses and on Capitol Hill, as NBC News has previously reported.",
      "Economists and retail trade groups estimate that tariffs on goods flowing into the U.S. could cost Americans $78 billion annually. For example, a $50 pair of shoes could cost almost $65, according to the National Retail Federation. The cost of a $2,000 mattress could rise by $190. Retail chain Five Below, online outlet Wayfair and Dollar Tree are some of the most vulnerable stores in a trade war, according to a CNBC analysis.",
      "\u201cOther countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we\u2019ve done for the world, and the tariff will be substantial,\u201d Trump said during his Sept. presidential debate against Harris.",

      "The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, also known as the USMCA, was negotiated during Trump's first administration and went into effect in July 2020. Tariffs proposed by Trump in his social media posts would likely violate the pact, according to Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico's former ambassador to the U.S."

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 22:00:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Special counsel Jack Smith filed to drop all charges against Donald Trump over his handling of classified documents and efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Special counsel Jack Smith on Monday filed motions to drop all federal charges against President-elect Donald Trump regarding his mishandling of classified documents and his effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the lead-up to the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S Capitol.",
      "Hours later, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan granted Smith's motion to dismiss the Jan. 6-related indictment, formally bringing to an end the case that alleged Trump unlawfully conspired to overturn his 2020 loss to President Joe Biden.",
      "Trump was first indicted in June 2023 in a federal court in Miami on 37 felony counts related to mishandling classified documents that he took from the White House to his Florida home. They included willful retention of national defense information, making false statements, and conspiracy to\u00a0obstruct justice. A Florida judge dismissed the case, but Smith's office had sought an appeal.",
      "Trump was separately indicted on four felonies in August 2023 for his attempt to reverse the 2020 election results: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiracy against rights.",
      "The case was then put on hold for months as Trump\u2019s team argued that the case should be thrown out for multiple reasons, including that a former president cannot be prosecuted for his actions in office.",
      "Trump has claimed that the prosecutions were politically motivated. He has never publicly conceded that his election claims were, in fact, false, and he pleaded not guilty in both federal cases.",
      "The federal indictments of Trump marked an extraordinary moment in American history \u2014 the first-ever accusation that a president sought illegally to cling to power, mishandled classified information and attempted to obstruct a federal investigation.",
      "Their dismissal also marks a historic moment. Fifty years after lawmakers from both parties forced Richard Nixon to resign the presidency amid allegations of criminal conduct in office, half of American voters chose to return Trump to the presidency.",
      "Trump's election victory means that the Justice Department\u2019s longstanding position that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime will apply to Trump after he takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "\"That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government\u2019s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Government stands fully behind,\" Smith\u2019s office wrote in Monday\u2019s filing.",
      "\u201cThe Government\u2019s position on the merits of the defendant\u2019s prosecution has not changed. But the circumstances have,\" the special counsel added.",
      "The DOJ policy, which was adopted during the Watergate scandal, notes that Congress has the power to impeach a president if they commit crimes. It is designed to allow sitting presidents to perform their duties without being hindered by legal cases.",
      "That legal position from DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel is the same one that helped Trump avoid being charged in connection with Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel probe during Trump\u2019s first presidency. Mueller\u2019s team decided that they could not reach a final conclusion on whether they believed Trump committed a crime, since they could not charge a sitting president.",
      "Charging Trump was \u201cnot an option we could consider,\u201d Mueller explained in 2019. Now the same OLC opinion is preventing Smith\u2019s case from going forward.",
      "Following Trump\u2019s re-election, the special counsel\u2019s office was caught between \u201ctwo fundamental and compelling national interests,\u201d Smith\u2019s team wrote. \u201cOn the one hand, the Constitution\u2019s requirement that the President must not be unduly encumbered in fulfilling his weighty responsibilities ... and on the other hand, the Nation\u2019s commitment to the rule of law and the longstanding principle that \u201c[n]o man in this country is so high that he is above the law.\u201d",
      "Smith and his team plan to resign before Trump takes office, one source told NBC News earlier this month. Special counsel regulations require Smith to file a report to the attorney general explaining his charging decisions before he steps down.",
      "Key help from conservative judges",
      "Conservative judges on the Supreme Court handed Trump a sweeping victory in the case with its ruling on presidential immunity. The justices first took months to issue a decision, making it impossible for the federal judge in Washington overseeing the case, Chutkan, to conduct a trial before the election.",
      "In a July ruling, they gave the president sweeping new immunity from prosecution, finding that all of a president's interactions with the attorney general were \"absolutely immune\" from prosecution. In a dissenting opinion, liberal justices argued that the ruling gave presidents the power to order federal criminal investigations of their rivals without legal consequences.",
      "Two weeks later, the Trump-appointed federal judge overseeing the classified documents case, Aileen Cannon, threw out all of the charges against Trump accusing him of mishandling classified documents and attempting to obstruct the investigation.",
      "In a decision that legal experts widely criticized and that Smith vowed to appeal, Cannon found that Smith had not been properly appointed as a special counsel. The surprise ruling reversed decades of past rulings by both liberal and conservative judges.",
      "In August, a new federal grand jury indicted Trump on the same four charges in the election case, alleging that Trump\u2019s false claims about mass voter fraud during the 2020 election were \u201cunsupported, objectively unreasonable, and ever-changing\u201d and that Trump \u201cknew that they were false.\u201d But Trump's re-election ended Smith's ability to move forward with those charges.",
      "Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement, \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump, and is a major victory for the rule of law. The American People and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.\u201d",
      "Many Jan. 6 defendants have told judges they lament that they were \"gullible\" enough to fall for Trump's falsehoods, which were echoed by the president-elect's allies, Republicans in Congress and conservative influencers on social media.",
      "The Justice Department is focused on arresting the \"most egregious\" rioters before Trump returns to office. The president-elect has said he will\u00a0pardon\u00a0some undetermined portion of Jan. 6 rioters, whom he\u2019s called \u201cwarriors,\u201d \u201cunbelievable patriots,\u201d political prisoners and \u201chostages.\u201d",
      "He is expected to walk through the lower west tunnel, where some of the worst violence of Jan. 6 took place, to be sworn in as president on Jan. 20, 2025."

    "story": [
      "As President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to lead the CDC, Dave Weldon, a former congressman from Florida and a physician, is positioned as an important anti-vaccine ally for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick for health secretary.",
      "Experts say the Weldon nomination comes at a critical time for the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: The U.S. is dealing with various health threats, including H5N1 bird flu, whooping cough and a spike in measles cases.",
      "Weldon served 14 years in Congress, representing the 15th District of Florida, where he was an outspoken critic of the public health agency and its vaccine program.",
      "In 2007, he introduced a bill to transfer responsibility for the nation\u2019s vaccine safety from the CDC to an independent agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, significantly reducing the CDC's role. It didn't get beyond committees.",
      "He also pushed a false claim that thimerosal, a preservative used in vaccines, is linked to autism, and advocated for limits on abortion.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Weldon will have considerable influence over vaccine policy in the U.S.\u00a0The CDC is responsible for tracking and responding to infectious diseases, developing vaccine guidelines, collecting and analyzing health data and managing public health emergencies.",
      "He would also work under Kennedy, since the CDC is one of 13 divisions overseen by HHS.",
      "Kennedy is known as a leading anti-vaccine activist, particularly for making a false claim that vaccines are tied to autism.",
      "\u201cAnti-vaccine people are celebrating this because they firmly see Weldon as an ally,\u201d said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy researcher at the University of California Law-San Francisco. \u201cIn Congress, he believed that vaccines caused autism, and he tried to promote that belief.\u201d",
      "The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Kennedy and Weldon \u2018in the driver\u2019s seat\u2019",
      "In a Friday post on Truth Social about Weldon's nomination, Trump said the current health of Americans is \"critical\" and the CDC must \"step up and correct past errors.\"",
      "It's unclear what Kennedy or Weldon, if confirmed, would do about vaccines that have already been approved or the agency overall, although Kennedy told NBC News this month that despite previous comments, he wouldn\u2019t \u201ctake away anybody\u2019s vaccines.\u201d",
      "Still, Kennedy and Weldon could have enormous influence over how vaccines are recommended in the U.S., including for children.",
      "The CDC provides vaccine recommendations for the public, including the pediatric vaccine schedule, which is followed by schools and parents. It includes vaccinations for diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, polio and hepatitis, and is updated annually.",
      "Typically, the CDC director follows the recommendations developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, an outside group of more than a dozen pediatricians, public health experts and vaccine researchers, said Jennifer Kates, director of the Global Health & HIV Policy Program at KFF, a health policy research group. The ACIP was formed in 1964, and aside from children's vaccines, it also advises on adult vaccines, such as those for influenza, shingles and Covid, vaccine recommendations for travelers and provide guidance during disease outbreaks.",
      "However, Kates said, the CDC director has authority to decide whether to accept those recommendations, and the HHS secretary can choose who sits on the vaccine committee.",
      "\u201cThis puts CDC, and HHS, in the driver\u2019s seat for determining vaccine recommendations going forward,\u201d she said.",
      "States are not required to follow the CDC\u2019s guidance, but most do, Reiss said.\u00a0States can also provide exemptions from school immunization requirements. The CDC recently reported that the rate of children with vaccine exemptions entering kindergarten reached an all-time high of 3.3%.",
      "As HHS secretary, Kennedy could replace members of the ACIP with anti-vaccine advocates who make recommendations that the CDC approves, Reiss speculated. Alternatively, Weldon, as the CDC director, could reject any ACIP recommendations that the administration disapproves of.",
      "\u201cIf they do that, states are a lot less likely to follow the guidance, or it could be fractured along political lines,\u201d she said, with Democratic states still following ACIP\u2019s recommended vaccines.",
      "It also has important implications for insurance coverage: Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies have to cover vaccines recommended by the ACIP.",
      "\u201cIf the committee makes a different recommendation and doesn\u2019t recommend some vaccines, insurance companies don\u2019t have to cover them,\u201d Reiss said. \u201cThey may cover them. They\u2019ve covered vaccines before the Affordable Care Act as well, but it\u2019s up to the good of their heart at that point.\u201d",
      "Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and a frequent target of anti-vaccine activists, said the CDC is vital as the U.S. has \u201csome very serious infectious disease and pandemic threats looming.\"",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got H5N1 accelerating in birds, in poultry and in cattle, and that\u2019s got to be an all-hands-on-deck starting Jan. 20,\u201d Hotez said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve got a fivefold rise in pertussis over the last year, these measles outbreaks.\"",
      "Cases of pertussis, more commonly known as whooping cough, in the U.S. are at the highest levels in a decade, according to CDC data.",
      "A recent report from the World Health Organization and the CDC found that cases of measles rose in 2023 to 10.3 million globally. More than 100,000 people around the world died from measles in 2023, mostly children under 5.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s going to manage this?\u201d Hotez asked."

    "story": [
      "Figuring out when to buy gifts for the holidays can be endlessly stressful: Is it better to scoop up purchases before the big Thanksgiving sales events, spring into action during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, or wait until the last minute? NBC News is helping shoppers answer those questions by tracking the online prices of five popular gift items in major categories this season.",
      "We evaluated products from kitchen appliances and TVs to Bluetooth headphones, toys and shoes, zeroing in on five that are likely to be bestsellers in their categories, according to experts at Consumer Reports, Wirecutter and Wired:",
      "General electronics: Apple AirPods Pro 2Toys: Magna-TilesKitchen appliances: Ninja 12-cup programmable coffee brewerApparel and footwear: Reebok Club C sneakersTVs: TCL 65-inch TV",

      "Kitchen appliances: Ninja 12-cup programmable coffee brewer",
      "Apparel and footwear: Reebok Club C sneakers",
      "TVs: TCL 65-inch TV",
      "We\u2019ve been tracking the prices of these items on major retail websites \u2014 including Amazon, Target, Walmart and others \u2014 every week from Amazon\u2019s Prime Day back in July through the holiday shopping period, highlighting when each of them is cheapest.",
      "What we\u2019ve found so far: For one thing, Amazon tends to set the pace of discounts, but its major rivals are following closely on the e-commerce giant\u2019s heels with increasingly competitive discounts of their own. Second, retailers change prices regularly, making unannounced price cuts on various items all the time. That creates something of a trade-off for customers \u2014 with more opportunities to hit on a deal but fewer ways to plan ahead to snag one.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a race, it\u2019s a game,\u201d shopping expert Trae Bodge told NBC News last week.",
      "Even so, the discounts are now ramping up. Take the AirPods and the Ninja coffee maker, for example: This past weekend, both hit their lowest online prices since NBC News began tracking them months ago.",

      "For the first time in several years, holiday shoppers are confronting an economy in which inflation has almost entirely slowed to a normal rate, even though many consumers are still adjusting to the higher levels where prices have settled. In a holiday survey the accounting firm PwC shared with NBC News, 59% of consumers said inflation was likely to influence their shopping decisions.",
      "Even so, consumer sentiment has been inching higher for the last four months, and bargain-hungry shoppers are rewarding many retailers for leaning into deals and discounts. Overall spending is projected to increase by 7% to an average of $1,638 per shopper this holiday season, according to PwC.",
      "Adobe, which tracks e-commerce spending, told NBC News it forecasts total holiday spending to top $240 billion this year, up 8.4% from last year \u2014 which would be the biggest annual jump since the start of the pandemic. Over half of this spending is expected to be driven by electronics, apparel, furniture and home goods.",
      "The company foresees holiday discounts roughly as deep as those on offer last year but a \u201cmuch stronger reaction from the consumer,\u201d according to Adobe lead digital analyst Vivek Pandya.",
      "People are \u201cwilling to spend on discretionary goods, holiday gift items, but they want to at the right price and at really strong value levels,\u201d he said.",
      "Indeed, 37% of shoppers recently told Deloitte researchers that they only plan to make purchases around Black Friday and Cyber Monday if items are at least 50% off.",
      "Average discounts aren\u2019t expected to be quite that deep. After peaking at roughly 30% around Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday four days later, Adobe expects them to soften again for the rest of December \u201cbut remain relatively favorable for consumers,\u201d Pandya said.",
      "The best time to buy might vary by product category.",
      "Thanksgiving Day should be an ideal time to shop for toys, appliances, furniture and sporting goods, Adobe said, whereas Black Friday will have the lowest prices for televisions. Cyber Monday should see some of the steepest discounts on general electronics and apparel, but the best deals for computers are projected to arrive on Saturday, Nov. 30.",
      "The upsides for shoppers could go beyond price, Pandya added. Retailers are also \u201cgoing to have to decide how they compete on price versus other differentiators that they offer, be it shipping perks [or] perks around loyalty and membership programs,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, senior politics reporter Alex Seitz-Wald breaks down the long-standing Democratic truisms that were challenged by the results of the 2024 elections. Plus, special counsel Jack Smith filed to drop all federal charges against Donald Trump in the election interference and classified documents cases.",

      "5 Democratic assumptions shattered by the 2024 election",
      "Democrats have been eager to draw tactical lessons from their second loss to Donald Trump, but they\u2019ve so far been more reluctant to reconsider some of the fundamental assumptions about the broader political landscape that has guided their strategy.",
      "The party has been slow to update its mythology to the Trump-era political realignment, leading many Democrats to continue leaning on truisms that may no longer be true.",
      "As the final votes are still being counted, it will take some time for the full story of the election to become clear. But exit polls and results from key areas around the country have already revealed new realities that Democrats will need to adjust to as they rebuild for the future.",
      "Here are five of the party\u2019s core assumptions that have been challenged by the 2024 election outcome:",
      "1. Higher turnout benefits Democrats: Democrats have long taken for granted a simple truism: The more people who vote, the better for Democrats. That may have been true once \u2014 though that is also unclear \u2014 and it\u2019s a feel-good story for a party that aligns itself with democracy.",
      "But in the Trump era, Democrats have become the party of more reliable voters (college-educated, higher-income and older voters), while Republicans often stand to gain by turning out low-propensity voters (non-college-educated and blue-collar voters) who are mostly apolitical but like Trump.",
      "That dynamic helps why Democrats have performed better in recent midterm, off-year and special elections and why polls have consistently underestimated Trump\u2019s support. Non-presidential elections have lower turnout, so the edge often goes to the party with the most reliable voters, which until recently was typically Republicans.",
      "2. Democrats are the party of the working class: For more than a century, Democrats have viewed themselves as the party of workers and the GOP as the party of the bosses. Strongly aligned with labor unions, Democrats have supported welfare programs and populist economic politics like higher taxes on the wealthy.",
      "In 2024, Democrats lost the working class by the two most common measures \u2014 income and education levels. NBC News exit polls show Trump won voters without college degrees 56%-42%, while he narrowly won voters with family incomes of $30,000 to $100,000 annually. Kamala Harris won voters with annual incomes over $200,000.",
      "That\u2019s a reversal from the previous elections. Even as she lost the 2016 election to Trump, Hillary Clinton still won low-income voters by double-digit margins and kept the education gap close, while Barack Obama easily won non-college-educated voters in 2012, according to NBC News exit polls.",
      "3. Trump can\u2019t expand his base: This is one reason why some Democrats viewed Trump as beatable, especially after his 2020 defeat. But on his third run for the White House, Trump expanded his base of support into major cities, onto Native American reservations and into heavily Latino communities.",
      "He gained ground in battleground state cities like Philadelphia and Detroit, while improving his performance in even famously liberal areas like Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles County and Chicago\u2019s Cook County. And he regained ground in affluent suburbs that had drifted away from the GOP in recent years, such as Loudoun County, Virginia.",
      "4. Latinos and immigrants will vote against restrictive immigration policies: Democrats have based their Latino outreach and immigration policies around this implicitly accepted assumption.",
      "But Trump had the best-ever performance for a Republican presidential candidate among Latinos, according to NBC News exit polls, outright winning Latino men, while increasing support among Asian Americans and in immigrant communities from Dearborn, Michigan to Lawrence, Massachusetts.",
      "Trump nearly swept the heavily Latino counties in Texas along the border with Mexico, several of which have voted Democratic for generations. And the only Manhattan precinct to go for a Republican presidential candidate this decade is an apartment complex that\u2019s home mainly to Chinese immigrants.",
      "5. The Electoral College is biased against Democrats: Until this month, both Republicans elected president in the 21st Century lost the popular vote, leading many Democrats to conclude the Electoral College is structurally biased against them.",
      "The idea has some merit, as big blue states like California and New York are unrepresented relative to low-population red ones like Wyoming. But Trump won both the Electoral College and popular vote this year as Harris\u2019 performance fell in those Democratic bastions.",
      "Jack Smith files to drop all federal charges against Trump",
      "Special counsel Jack Smith on Monday filed motions to drop all federal charges against President-elect Donald Trump regarding his mishandling of classified documents and his effort to overturn his 2020 presidential election in the lead-up to the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S Capitol.",
      "Hours later, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan\u00a0granted\u00a0Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss the Jan. 6-related indictment, formally\u00a0bringing\u00a0to an end the case that alleged Trump unlawfully conspired to overturn his 2020 loss to President Joe Biden.",
      "Trump was indicted in June 2023 in a federal court in Miami on 37 felony counts related to mishandling classified documents that he took from the White House to his Florida home. They included willful retention of national defense information, making false statements, and conspiracy to obstruct justice. A Florida judge dismissed the case, but Smith\u2019s office had sought an appeal.",
      "Trump was separately indicted on four felonies in August 2023 for his attempt to reverse the 2020 election results: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights.",
      "Trump has claimed that the prosecutions were politically motivated. He has never publicly conceded that his election claims were, in fact, false, and he pleaded not guilty in both federal cases.",
      "The federal indictments of Trump were an extraordinary moment in American history \u2014 the first-ever accusation that a president had illegally sought to cling to power, mishandled classified information and attempted to obstruct a federal investigation.",
      "Their dismissal is also a historic moment. Fifty years after lawmakers from both parties forced Richard Nixon to resign the presidency amid allegations of criminal conduct in office, half of American voters chose to return Trump to the presidency.",
      "Trump\u2019s election means that the Justice Department\u2019s longstanding position that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime will apply to him after he takes office on Jan. 20.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 19:53:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Many South Asian immigrants are worried a second Trump term will either drastically slow down or quash the potential of securing an H1B.",
    "story": [
      "Like many visa-holding immigrants, a 24-year-old Ph.D. student in upstate New York said she lives in a constant state of anxiety. The student, who asked to be anonymous out of fear of retaliation, is currently on an F-1 student visa and worries that if she leaves the country even on a vacation, she might not be let back in, that her status might suddenly change.",
      "With President-elect Donald Trump preparing to retake office with a crew of Cabinet members with anti-legal immigration platforms, she now has an additional worry: it might be impossible for her to get on a more permanent H-1B, a visa for specialized occupations, when she graduates.",
      "\u201cI am anxious to know how and what changes he ends up making,\u201d the student said. \u201cIn four years, the world could be literally at 180 degrees.\u201d",
      "Following Trump\u2019s re-election victory, many immigrants are worried a second Trump term would introduce restrictions on the H-1B visa program, like he attempted to do during his first term. Trump himself, his allies and Cabinet picks have made promises to make cuts to the program, which experts say would have a huge impact on the tech sector.",
      "\u201cPeople are in a state of panic \u2026 they are expecting the worst,\u201d said Shakeel Syed, executive director of the nonprofit South Asian Network. \u201c\u2018Is my application going to be accepted? During the course of my approval process, where do I stand? Can I be deported?\u201d",
      "The H-1B, or high-skill visa program, is overwhelmingly used by Indians. They make up about 75% of all petitioners, far outpacing even the next highest group, Chinese workers, who make up under 12%.",
      "While the visa program can encompass any field that requires a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, the tech industry makes up the vast majority and would face the most severe impacts of increased restrictions.",
      "Stephen Miller, who is joining Trump\u2019s White House as deputy chief of staff for policy, is expected to be a leader in the administration\u2019s immigration agenda. During his previous role as a senior adviser, Miller took staunch-anti-immigration stances and influenced policy that raised H-1B denials and tightened restrictions on the program.",
      "\u201cStephen Miller has been very effective in the previous administration in cutting down immigration numbers,\u201d said Gaurav Khanna, an assistant professor of economics and an immigration scholar at the University of California, San Diego.",
      "The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment on behalf of Trump or Miller.",
      "Other allies like Vivek Ramaswamy, nominated alongside Elon Musk to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, has in the past said he would \u201cgut\u201d the H-1B program if given the chance.",
      "Ramaswamy\u2019s representatives did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump himself has shared that opinion. Answering a question about H-1Bs during a 2016 Republican presidential debate, he said, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have it. Very, very bad for workers.\u201d",
      "What action has the federal government taken in the past?",
      "Immigration experts say that while only Congress can\u2019t set visa caps, the federal government can make the processes for visa applications slower and more difficult.",
      "The first Trump administration increased wage requirements for H-1B applicants beyond what citizens working in those sectors would earn, impacting entry-level workers. The rule was eventually shot down by a federal judge in 2020, but it caused tech companies to scramble, according to immigration law firm Berry Appleman & Leiden.",
      "Trump\u2019s Department of Homeland Security also attempted to narrow the definition of a \u201cspecialty occupation\u201d that qualified for an H-1B. That was also shot down in court.",
      "\u201cThey do have the power to heavily audit firms and make life very difficult for companies that are hiring H-1B workers,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cThe tech sector is heavily reliant on H-1B workers. If you cut off that supply, the tech sector is going to be unhappy.\u201d",
      "During the 2016 presidential debate, Trump admitted he had hired H-1B workers himself. At his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump also regularly hires immigrant workers, sponsoring H-2A visas to bring in seasonal employees.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that I frankly use and I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.\u201d",
      "A possible chilling effect, at minimum",
      "While she waits for answers about her place in the U.S., the Ph.D. student from upstate New York says she\u2019s worried that anti-immigrant sentiment will make her life difficult no matter what her status is.",
      "\u201cMy defenses are always up,\u201d she said.",
      "Khanna and Syed both said that anti-immigrant rhetoric from the Trump administration might, by itself, be an effective tool at creating an H-1B chilling effect at companies who normally sponsor these visa-holders. While it would dent the tech sector, everyday South Asians working in the U.S. would be targeted, despite their immigration status.",
      "\u201cThat anti-Asian phobia, anti immigrant phobia is going to be impactful in spite of having full legal status,\u201d Syed said."

    "story": [
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will provide rebates to residents if President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration does away with a federal tax credit for electric vehicles.",
      "In a news release issued Monday, Newsom said he would restart the state's Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, which provided financial incentives on more than 590,000 vehicles before it was phased out late 2023.",
      "\"We will intervene if the Trump Administration eliminates the federal tax credit, doubling down on our commitment to clean air and green jobs in California,\" Newsom said. \"We\u2019re not turning back on a clean transportation future \u2014 we\u2019re going to make it more affordable for people to drive vehicles that don\u2019t pollute.\"",
      "The federal rebates on new and used electric vehicles were implemented in the Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022. When Trump's second term in office begins next year, he could work with Congress to change the rules around those rebates. Those potential changes could limit the federal rebates, including by reducing the amount of money available or limiting who is eligible.",
      "Limiting federal subsidies on electric vehicle purchases would hurt many American automakers, including Ford, General Motors and the EV startup Rivian. Tesla, which also builds its automobiles in the United States, would take a smaller hit since that company currently sells more EVs and has a higher profit margin than any other EV manufacturer.",
      "Newsom also announced earlier this month that he will convene a special session in December \"to protect California values,\" including fundamental civil rights and reproductive rights, that he said \"are under attack by this incoming administration.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Democratic National Committee will elect a new chair Feb. 1, the party announced Monday, as it reels from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory earlier this month.",
      "Democrats will hold four public forums throughout January for candidates to make their pitches ahead of the party\u2019s winter meeting in National Harbor, Maryland, just outside Washington, where they will elect new officers, including the chair.",
      "The only voters are the 448 active members of the DNC, which includes party insiders, elected officials and leaders of allied groups like unions from across the country, but the party says it is soliciting input from outsiders and the general public.",
      "Details of the rules governing the contest will be fleshed out when the party\u2019s Rules and Bylaws Committee meets Dec. 12, but current rules require candidates to secure signatures of support from at least 40 DNC members in order to be in contention and on the ballot.",

Martin O\u2019Malley and Minnesota Democratic Chair Ken Martin \u2014 while several others are actively considering bids. That includes Wisconsin state party Chair Ben Wikler, who is set to announce a decision right after Thanksgiving, a person with knowledge of his thinking said.",

    "summary": "The Congressional Black Caucus will have 62 members in the 119th Congress, contributing to a record 67 Black representatives.",
    "story": [
      "The Congressional Black Caucus will boast a record 62 members for the next session of Congress, contributing toward the highest number of Black federal lawmakers in history, according to a post-election report by the organization shared with NBC News.",
      "In all, 67 Black people will serve in Congress. Five Republican members are not listed as members of the CBC.",
      "While the caucus's members had planned to uphold a policy agenda for Black and marginalized people under a Kamala Harris administration, instead Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said the CBC's role will be to hold President-elect Donald Trump and his congressional supporters accountable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve always been the conscience of the Congress, and that\u2019s no matter who\u2019s in charge,\u201d Meeks, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told NBC News. \u201cWe always try to work with folks where we can. But we call them out also. And now we have more of these leaders to call truth to power, to make sure that the voices of the voiceless are heard.\u201d",
      "The Congressional Black Caucus, established in 1971, is not tied to a political party, though all members are Democrats. Its mission has been to represent Black and marginalized groups through voter enfranchisement, health care access, broader educational opportunities, jobs, reform of the criminal justice system and foreign relations with predominantly Black nations around the world. According to its website, members of the CBC currently represent 120 million people in the U.S. and 41% of Black Americans.",
      "Meeks said the CBC\u2019s mission will be clear for Congress\u2019 119th session: to challenge the Trump administration on policies that affect Black people especially, like health care access and prescription drug costs, among other issues. And \u201cloudly,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cInstead of just having a quartet, now you\u2019ve got a whole choir,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cAnd we will be loud, we will be clear, and we\u2019re going to be constant and consistent, because this administration is a danger.\u201d",
      "Meeks criticized Trump\u2019s Cabinet selections and policies, particularly Dr. Mehmet Oz, who has been chosen to oversee Medicaid and Medicare, and Linda McMahon, Trump\u2019s secretary of education pick. Meeks said he expects the group will maintain vocal dissent when necessary, but will proactively focus on policies that will affect average people.",
      "The Trump transition team did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Meeks pointed to calls to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, which the CBC would\u00a0vehemently oppose. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be showing exactly who is working on that effort, because it\u2019s going to have a direct effect on our community,\u201d he said.",
      "Both the House and Senate will be in Republican control, limiting the potential impact the CBC and congressional Democrats more broadly. Niccara Campbell Wallace, executive director of the Rolling Sea Action Fund, said this makes the CBC\u2019s growth from 60 members in the 118th Congress all the more noteworthy.",
      "\u201cDespite the Republicans having the House and the Senate\u201d next session, she said, \u201cyou feel good about what these historic number of Black Congress members can do in terms of helping influence what comes down the pipe.\u201d",
      "Rolling Sea Action Fund is a hybrid PAC that raises money for Black congressional candidates as well as for ads and other election expenses.",
      "Wallace said her work and the CBC\u2019s are vital because \u201cBlack Americans have believed in the ideals of what America can and will be, despite us not always having a seat at the table or being in the forefront of the Founding Fathers\u2019 minds.\u201d",
      "Beyond legislating and countering the Trump administration, Meeks said he is already looking ahead to the midterm elections of 2026.",
      "\u201cTwo years go around very fast,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be campaigning and moving forward for the entire two years.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be making it clear that in just two years, we can reverse and stop some of the things, some of the tragedies, of the administration-elect,\u201d he continued, \u201cand that their policies will be putting the plague on our communities, as well as poor white communities. It\u2019s going to have an effect on the whole country.\u201d"

      "A white Florida woman who fatally shot her Black neighbor through a locked door was sentenced to 25 years in prison Monday for the \"completely unnecessary\" gunfire.",
      "Marion County Circuit Court Judge Robert Hodges said Susan Louise Lorincz, 60, did \"significant harm\" to the victim and her family.",
      "\"I find that the shooting was completely unnecessary,\" the judge said. \"In this case, Ms. Lorincz was behind the door. The door was locked.\"",
      "Lorincz, who residents said had a history of harassing children and using racial slurs, was convicted of manslaughter three months ago for last year\u2019s slaying of Ajike \u201cAJ\u201d Owens.",
      "She faced up to 30 years in prison. However, her defense lawyer told the court she deserved less than the 11.5-year minimum, saying that she has a mental disorder and was under \u201cextreme duress\u201d during the deadly confrontation.",
      "The judge said he couldn't see his way clear to letting her off with probation as the defense had asked.",
      "\"She\u2019s a victim of child sex abuse was a significant mitigating factor, and she has no criminal record, which is also a significant factor,\" the judge said. \"However, we also have a tremendous harm inflicted upon this family and the victim's family.\"",
      "Owens knocked on Lorincz's door in Ocala, about 70 miles north of Walt Disney World, on June 2, 2023, not long after Lorincz had bickered with the victim\u2019s children who were playing nearby.",
      "Lorincz fired a single round from a .380-caliber handgun and killed Owens, a mother of four, who was standing on the other side of a locked door, authorities said.",
      "Pamela Dias, the victim's mother, said the slaying has impacted every aspect of her life.",
      "\u201cI stand before you not only mourning the loss of my daughter, but also the loss of our hopes, dreams and the future that we often spoke of,\u201d Dias told the court.",
      "\u201cI\u2018m still trying to grasp and cope with the fact that my daughter, my baby girl, is lying six feet underground, breathless, lifeless.\u201d",
      "Owens\u2019 four children, were between 3 and 12 when their mother was killed.",
      "\u201cShe won\u2019t be present for the baptisms, the prom, graduations, their first love, their first breakups, engagements, marriages, children, all the (pivotal moments), all the important moments that a parent and a child, share together,\" Dias said.",
      "\u201cOur pain and suffering didn\u2019t end when Susan was found guilty of manslaughter. Our pain and suffering won\u2019t end with today\u2019s sentencing. Our pain and suffering will last a lifetime.\u201d",
      "The all-white, six-person jury found Lorincz guilty\u00a0of\u00a0manslaughter after just 2 1/2 hours of deliberations.",
      "Lorincz, dressed in a yellow jail jumpsuit in court Monday, said she regrets pulling the trigger.",
      "\"I am so sorry.\u00a0 I never intended to kill her,\" she told the court.\u00a0 \"I am just profoundly sad. Not only did a mother die but a daughter, a sister, I think of your family's loss.\"",
      "Two friends of Lorincz\u2019s and her pastor testified that the shooting was totally out of character for Lorincz. Her sister testified that they both suffered terrible physical and sexual abuse at the hands of their father.",
      "When Owens knocked on her door, the defense team's psychologist said Monday that Lorincz\u2019s PTSD led her to make a tragically bad choice.",
      "\u201cIt will be my opinion that, yes, that her ability to appreciate the criminality of her conduct or to conform her behavior will be substantially impaired because she\u2019s perceiving that her life is in danger,\u201d psychologist Jenny Castillo said in court.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s perceiving that the door, the locked door with the bolt, will not hold, and that Ms. Owens is going to victimize her. She describes shaking. She describes being overcome by fear, and in that moment, there is a lack of consideration.\u201d",
      "Lorincz wasn\u2019t immediately arrested after the shooting, drawing protests from Owens\u2019 family.",
      "Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods said his investigators needed that time to fully evaluate Lorincz's claim that was reasonably fearful when she opened fire.",
      "The sheriff said that while he supports Florida\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d law, he concluded it didn\u2019t apply here.",
      "Florida law grants wide latitude for use of deadly force in cases where there\u2019s a \u201creasonable\u201d fear of\u00a0 \u201cimminent death or great bodily harm.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis situation is a prime example of when it was not justified,\u201d the sheriff said when announcing Lorincz\u2019s arrest. \u201cIt was simply a killing.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A federal judge said Monday he may hold an evidentiary hearing next month to help determine whether to approve the sale of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' media company to satirical publication The Onion.",
      "Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston clarified the sale, which comes after a Nov. 13 auction, remains in limbo until such a hearing, when interested parties can make their case and he can decide which of Jones' assets, if any, can be sold. A date was not immediately set.",
      "He also declined to immediately rule on Jones' request for a temporary restraining order to disqualify the Onion's bid, and said \"whatever was status quo pre-auction remains status quo\" \u2014 essentially allowing Jones to remain broadcasting from his flagship platform, Infowars, for the time being.",
      "\"Firing folks a week before Thanksgiving is not what we do, but it sounds like that's not what occurred,\" Lopez said. \"Folks are continuing to work.\"",
      "Another bidder, First United American Companies, a limited liability company affiliated with Jones' dietary supplements business, had challenged the results of the auction after it said it bid twice as much cash as the Onion.",
      "At stake is the ownership of Infowars' intellectual property, including its website \u2014 the prized asset in the auction in which proceeds are largely meant to help satisfy defamation verdicts awarded to several families of the victims of the 2012\u00a0Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "The families won lawsuits against Jones in 2022 after he repeatedly called the massacre that left 20 children and six staff members\u00a0dead in Newtown, Connecticut, a \"hoax\" on his Infowars broadcast. He filed for bankruptcy in his home state of Texas in the wake of the nearly $1.5 billion in legal judgments.",
      "Jones' company, Free Speech Systems, was set to go to the Onion, which has often mocked him in its faux news coverage, after bankruptcy trustee Christopher Murray\u00a0announced the winning bid.",
      "But First United American Companies quickly contested the results, saying in an emergency filing attempting to block the sale that it had offered $3.5 million in cash \u2014 compared to the Onion's $1.75 million.",
      "The auction process approved by Lopez did not require Murray to automatically select the bidder that submitted the highest amount, and the trustee could reject the bid that was \"contrary to the best interests\" of the estate creditors.",
      "Lopez said Monday that the focus of an evidentiary hearing will be on Murray's business judgment in regard to how the auction was held. He said he may decide to approve the sale, order another auction or hold additional hearings.",
      "\"I want a fair and transparent process, and let's see where that process goes,\" Lopez said, adding, \"Everyone will have their day in court.\"",
      "At a prior court hearing following the auction, Murray said, \"the creditors ended up significantly better off\" under the Onion's bid. He also explained in a filing that the majority of Sandy Hook families were willing to forgo their share of the sale proceeds and instead take a percentage from future revenues from a revamped Infowars, which would allow the other creditors to collect more money.",
      "The Onion estimates its total bid value is $7 million.",
      "But Walter Cicack, a lawyer for First American United Companies, said in its filing that the arrangement amounts to a \"Monopoly\" money bid since any future revenues are undetermined.",
      "\"This was not simply collaboration,\" he said of the Onion's support from Sandy Hook families, \"this was outright collusive bid rigging.\"",
      "Chris Mattei, an attorney for some of the victims' families, said in a previous statement that\u00a0the Onion did \"a public service\" by spearheading the purchase and \"will meaningfully hinder Jones' ability to do more harm.\"",
      "Lawyers for the Onion said in a filing Sunday that the company has been \"harassed and threatened by the Debtor and members of his audience since their winning bid was announced.\" They argued that the sale should proceed, writing that a joint bid \"does not amount to collusion\" and disputing the idea that there was a lack of transparency because the auction used a sealed bid process.",
      "\"Sealed bids maintain the competitive tension between bidders and force bidders to offer up their best terms irrespective of where other bids sit,\" the lawyers wrote, adding, \"Far from maintaining this process in secrecy, once the Trustee selected the Successful Bidder, the Trustee publicly disclosed all information about the Qualified Bids, including by disclosing copies of the initial and final bids submitted by each Qualified Bidder.\"",
      "Onion CEO Ben Collins \u2014 who previously covered disinformation and conspiracy theories for NBC News \u2014 had said on social media that while \"the judge had some questions about process and assets,\" its \"bid with the families is clearly the best.\"",
      "Collins also wrote that the Onion plans to relaunch Infowars as \"the dumbest website on the internet.\" A person with knowledge of the sale\u00a0told NBC News the new platform will include well-known internet humor writers and content creators.",
      "In announcing the sale, the Onion put out a news release written in the voice of a satirical CEO of Global Tetrahedron, the publication's Chicago-based parent company.",
      "Infowars was briefly shut down after the sale was announced before it resumed operating with Jones, who claimed the site was \"hijacked.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Jones \u2014 who built a small media empire off of promoting conspiracy theories and misinformation \u2014 has claimed that Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump are investigating the bankruptcy auction in his favor after Musk's X Corp. filed a notice of appearance in the case. X Corp. is presumed to be an interested party because Jones uses X to broadcast his show and the case involves the potential transfer of Jones' X handle in the sale.",
      "Lawyers for Jones filed a request last week for a temporary restraining order to invalidate the Onion's bid, and asserted that   First United American Companies should be the successful bidder. Jones described the auction process as \"fraudulent,\" but told his audience that regardless of what happens with Infowars, he won't be silenced."

      "Judge S. Kato Crews, with the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, denied the emergency motion for a preliminary injunction filed this month against the Mountain West Conference.",
      "The plaintiffs in the lawsuit that preceded the emergency motion included San Jose's co-captain Brooke Slusser and 10 athletes from other schools who argued that their Title IX rights are being violated by allowing the athlete to play for a women\u2019s sports team, according to the news outlet.",
      "The 132-page lawsuit sought to prevent the player from participating in the conference tournament.",
      "In addition to barring the athlete from the tournament, the emergency motion also sought to rescind the conference's policy that establishes wins, losses and forfeits if a member of a non-canceling team has a transgender player; rescind the wins SJSU had and losses against teams that refused to play SJSU and to recalculate winning percentages based on games from earlier this season that some teams forfeited and apply the new calculations, and seedings, to the conference tournament that begins Wednesday.",
      "Several conference teams have refused to play SJSU and instead forfeited the games.",
      "The player, whom NBC News is not naming, has never spoken publicly, and SJSU has not confirmed that one of its players is transgender.",
      "In Monday's ruling, the judge determined that the emergency motion was a heavy lift for the conference at the 11th hour and was not needed because teams that had previously forfeited did so knowing the conference's 2022 transgender policy.",
      "\u201cThe relief requested with the Emergency Motion would risk confusion and upend months of planning and would prejudice, at a minimum, Defendants and other teams participating in the tournament depending on the results of any reseeding. On balance, the equities favor the MWC\u2019s interest in conducting and proceeding with the tournament as planned,\" the ruling read.",
      "The judge also cited other laws and previous rulings noting that it's impossible to discriminate against a person based on transgender status without discriminating against them based on sex.",
      "In a statement Monday, San Jose State lauded the judge's decision.",
      "\"San Jos\u00e9 State University will continue to support its student-athletes and reject discrimination in all forms,\" the university said said. \"All San Jos\u00e9 State University student-athletes are eligible to participate in their sports under NCAA and Mountain West Conference rules.\"",

      "Last month, multiple teams canceled games against San Jose State, including on Oct. 24, when the University of Nevada, Reno, canceled citing it would not have enough players.",
      "Nevada players announced\u00a0that they were refusing \"to participate in any match that advances injustice against female athletes,\u201d without providing further details. The school's athletic department said it wouldn\u2019t back out from the match, referencing state equality laws, but added that no players would be disciplined.",
      "The game was switched to San Jose, California, \u201cin the interest of both programs,\u201d the teams said in a joint statement \u2014 with no further explanation \u2014 before Nevada elected to forfeit.",
      "Earlier this season, Southern Utah, Boise State, Wyoming and Utah State also canceled games against their conference foe.",
      "This month, a group of more than a dozen Republican lawmakers urged the Mountain West to ban transgender women from competition after it was reported that a trans student competed on the women\u2019s volleyball team.",
      "In a\u00a0letter sent\u00a0Nov. 18 to the commissioner of the Mountain West Conference, Republican senators and representatives said the conference was violating Title IX sex discrimination protections and failing to meet its own requirements regarding gender equity.",

      "\u201cOver the last few years, more and more people who are going to Cuba are looking for ways to help,\u201d said Rebecca Shoval, program director for Not Just Tourists New York City, a volunteer effort that has connected underserved countries with hard to find resources for over 30 years. This year, they\u2019ve sent a \"record number\" of shipments to Cuba, according to the organization.",
      "Avi D'Souza, executive director of Not Just Tourists Toronto, said the organization has sent 475 suitcases of supplies this year \u2014 62% more than in 2023 and the majority of it to Cuba. In bulk, they've sent 298,000 lbs of medical supplies and equipment via container, 24% more than last year, he said.",
      "Shoval explained that tourists are given suitcases filled with medical supplies to bring to drop-off locations on the island.",
      "Anthony ImBoden, of Ontario, is one of many who expressed concerns and asked questions on a public Reddit forum regarding his upcoming vacation to Cuba. A diabetic whose insulin needs to be refrigerated, ImBoden asked for tips on how to travel with \u2014 and preserve \u2014 his medication through the power outages.",
      "Even though a Canadian travel advisory encourages visitors to \u201cexercise a high degree of caution in Cuba due to shortages of basic necessities including food, medicine and fuel,\" ImBoden said he\u2019s \u201ctaking [the concerns] with a grain of salt.\u201d",
      "While some people told him not to go, Imboden said his diabetes is well controlled and it\u2019s a risk he's \"willing to take.\u201d",
      "The Cuban government has blamed U.S. sanctions as well as the effect of the pandemic on tourism for the tougher economic conditions on the island, while the U.S. has blamed Cuba\u2019s centrally planned, communist economy. Cuba\u2019s lack of hard currency has affected its ability to import basic necessities.",
      "Recent travelers like Monica Joseph \u2014 who stayed at an Airbnb in  Cuba just before the massive outage \u2014 noted a feeling of safety in more tourist-centered areas like Havana, the capital. Though she did not experience blackouts herself, she did speak to many residents who described an inability to find goods like soap or sanitary products.",
      "Joseph, who lives near Washington, D.C., said she was told \u201cthat it was a bit better to be in the city\" but would have \"issues\" outside of Havana.",
      "The conditions outside of cities and tourist areas are a source of frustration for Cuban Americans like Mailen Rodr\u00edguez, 23, a kindergarten teacher from Houston who emigrated from Cuba when she was seven years old.",
      "\u201cIt was bad in 2007, but now it\u2019s even worse. \u2026 Back then, I don\u2019t ever remember sleeping without any light. Now, when I went in October, the [blackouts] were four to five hours every single day,\u201d Rodriguez said, asking why tourists aren\u2019t affected.",
      "\u201cWhy is it only affecting the people in the provinces that are scared to speak up and protest?\u201d",
      "The Cuban government didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on whether tourist areas are being given priority for electricity power and on countries' travel advisories warning of current conditions on the island.",
      "When Rodriguez visited Cuba in October, she brought her family basic necessities like toothpaste, toothbrushes, deodorant, shampoos, razors, clothing, shoes, and cooking seasonings \u2014 emphasizing that this was a luxury not afforded to many Cubans.",
      "\u201cThe people that have relatives over here, thankfully, they have a source of income, they have money for food, for any necessities,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t have family outside of the island, you\u2019re kind of stuck \u2014 it\u2019s really hard to get any resources.\u201d",
      "Carl Eaton, director of the Orange County California Chapter of Not Just Tourists, has become more aware of the needs in Cuba through his work.",
      "\u201cPeople who live in Cuba love Cuba, and they want to stay there because they love the island. However, a lot of people are reaching the end of the rope,\u201d Eaton said, mentioning that more people are trying to leave; the country has seen record migration out of Cuba.",
      "For tourists who want to help, \u201cCuba is probably one of the easiest countries in the world as far as aid warrants. They need the help, and they\u2019re not going to discourage anybody from bringing supplies into the country,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cThe big thing is to get through to the traveler that this is something that they can do, where they can make a difference.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian Wladimir Klitschko, a longtime boxing champion considered one of the greatest heavyweights ever, accused podcaster Joe Rogan of \u201crepeating Russian propaganda,\u201d following an episode in which Rogan implied that the Ukrainian and American leaders were \u201cabout to start World War III.\u201d",
      "In Friday\u2019s episode of \u201cJoe Rogan Experience,\u201d the host criticized President Joe Biden\u2019s move to authorize Ukraine to strike Russia with U.S.-provided long-range missiles and said he didn\u2019t feel safe that \u201cthey\u2019re launching missiles into Russia.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow are you allowed to do that when you\u2019re on the way out? Like the people don\u2019t want you to be there anymore,\u201d Rogan said. \u201cThis should be some sort of a pause for significant actions that could potentially start World War III. Maybe that would be a good thing that we would like to avoid from a dying former president.\u201d",
      "Rogan extended his criticisms to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, referring to a presidential address in which Zelenskyy had said that \u201cPutin is terrified,\u201d following the launch of ballistic missiles into Ukraine last Thursday, following Ukraine\u2019s strike against Russia earlier that week.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy says Putin is terrified. F--- you man. F--- you people. You F---ing people are about to start World War III,\u201d Rogan said.",
      "Rogan even accused Zelenskyy of \u201cdoing a lot of blow.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is cocaine-like behavior. \u2018Putin\u2019s fu----- scared, man, Putin\u2019s terrified. We got him.",
      "We got him, man, we got him.\u2019 Like, what are you talking about? He has nuclear missiles. You f----ing monkeys,\u201d Rogan said.",
      "False drug claims regarding Zelenskyy have been pushed by Russian propagandists in the past, including through a widely shared digitally altered video where Zelenskyy appears to say he uses cocaine, and through a disinformation campaign from Russian propaganda group Storm-1516. Last year, pro-Russian propagandists had also tricked celebrities into creating paid videos on Cameo that were then doctored to insinuate Zelenskyy had a drug problem.",
      "Klitschko, the retired Ukrainian boxer, responded by posting a video on X, addressed to Rogan, that has amassed 11 million views as of Monday. He called Rogan\u2019s commentary \u201cRussian propaganda.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou talk about these American weapons being sent to Ukraine, which you believe will lead to the Third World War, so let me tell you that you\u2019re repeating Russian propaganda,\u201d Klitschko said in his video. \u201cPutin\u2019s Russia is in trouble, so they want to scare you and people like you. His war was supposed to last three days. It has lasted three years thanks to the heroism and sacrifice of us Ukrainians. So you\u2019re using the only weapon that Putin really intends to use, propaganda, and this weapon really weakens our democracies.\u201d",
      "Klitschko closes off his video by calling on Rogan to have him on his podcast, where he said the two could discuss \u201clike free men\u201d his \u201cpoints of difference.\u201d",
      "Rogan\u2019s X account for his podcast later replied to Klitschko\u2019s video, writing \u201cDoes this make sense to anyone or just an attempt to get on the podcast?\u201d Klitschko then responded by saying \u201cFear Factor = Offering a public opinion about a nation, but not able to discuss your opinion and facts with another public figure of the nation you had the opinion about. We would only meet in the podcast ring not in the boxing ring. Let\u2019s do it! What are you waiting for?\u201d",
      "Klitschko held belts from the International Boxing Federation, the World Boxing Organization and the International Boxing Organization from 2008 until 2015. The former boxer did not lose a single fight from 2004 to 2015, and later retired in 2017. Klitschko\u2019s brother, Vitali Klitschko, is currently the mayor of Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, and was also a former heavyweight champion.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also addressed Rogan\u2019s comments, writing in an X post, \u201cHi @joerogan, freaking at Ukrainians without giving them a chance to speak isn\u2019t a fair fight. If you ever feel like having a real conversation, let\u2019s sit down and chat about anything Ukraine-related \u2014 dragons included. You know your stuff, I know mine. Cigars on me.\u201d",
      "Rogan also said in his Friday episode that he believes that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s upcoming administration would alleviate further conflict between Russia and Ukraine saying, \u201cWe voted Trump in and his idea is to stop all this sh--, and hopefully he can do that.\u201d",
      "Rogan endorsed Trump the day before the election, having previously had him as a guest on his podcast.",
      "CNN reported that Zelenskyy recently said that he believed that the war in Ukraine \u201cwill end faster with the policy of this team that will now lead the White House,\u201d referring to the Trump administration."

Is it possible I heard him yell, \u201cAlright, alright, alright!\u201d on the quad one sunny afternoon, or handed him a Solo cup at a party? Probably not, but I would bet money we once unknowingly duked it out through the telephone enrollment exchange for that last seat in Intro to Psychology.",
      "Still, what seems more meaningful in this context are our shared Irish roots and Texas upbringing, ranging from the southwest to the northeast parts of the state. We probably grew up surrounded by many of the same culinary influences \u2014 delicate Guajillo honey, enchiladas swimming in chili gravy, chicken fried steak at Luby\u2019s Cafeteria, red popsicles dripping in the light of a heat mirage and, yes, chilled tuna salad when it was too sweltering to turn on the oven.",
      "This is not my grandmother\u2019s tuna salad, though. The wasabi alone would have driven her to hysterics.",
      "Since there\u2019s no written recipe, I\u2019ll have to make some guesses about the details. I\u2019ll bet McConaughey grew up eating chunk light in water like the rest of us, a healthy pick if perhaps a little lacking in texture, but surely he buys the good stuff now? Let\u2019s assume this is a 21st-century McConaughey tuna salad, casually mature. I\u2019m going with a great middle-of-the-road solid pack in olive oil, but if you want to allocate an extra couple of bucks to make it really special, my top dietitian\u2019s pick is Scout for flavor, dolphin-friendliness and sustainability. You can also eat lower on the food chain if you\u2019re concerned about contaminants, and switch out sardines for canned tuna in any recipe. Feeling apprehensive? I find Mediterranean sardines to be less frighteningly fishy, and Bela is one of my favorite more-reasonably-priced-but-quality brands.",
      "I wander the aisles of Texas grocery titan H-E-B, choosing the rest of my raw materials. Tasked as I am with representing our shared influences accurately, I suddenly feel the selection of each component is infused with gravest import, and I wonder at the karmic vibe of my quest. Did I ever wait in line behind McConaughey at the H-E-B on East 41st, he with a frozen pizza and two pints of butter pecan, me with Reduced Fat Triscuits and an eggplant? The truth is lost to history.",
      "The apple? Granny Smith, surely. The pickles? He says \u201cdill gherkins,\u201d but is that dill-comma-gherkins as in both, or gherkins which are dill instead of sweet? Based on context cues, I\u2019m calling it the latter. The wasabi? Alas, most of what you will get stateside is actually fake wasabi made from ground European horseradish and some kind of coloring rather than real Japanese horseradish, which is expensive and only ephemerally pungent. Mine is fake but workable enough.",
      "One special ingredient note \u2014 the crispy jalape\u00f1os he refers to, I believe, are a kind of jalape\u00f1o version of fried French\u2019s onions, and you should find them near the other salad fixings at your grocery store. They are unbelievable. If you happen to be making green bean casserole for Thanksgiving, mix a few into your topping for a cut-above side dish.",
      "I\u2019ve made a couple of minor substitutions \u2014 I\u2019m using a shallot instead of red onion, and a little extra pickle juice instead of vinegar. I suggest mixing the dressing separately so the wasabi is evenly distributed without mauling your tuna. It seems like a lot of stuff piled on a modest hunk of fish, but after tasting it, I actually went back in and added more lemon, pickle juice, jalape\u00f1o chips, dill gherkins and especially more wasabi \u2014 I started out with about a quarter teaspoon but ended up adding a full teaspoon. (Note that if you\u2019re using the real-deal leftover-from-your-lunch sushi, you may want less.)",
      "The final result is simply stellar, the best tuna salad I\u2019ve ever had, much less made myself. It\u2019s unconventional, to be sure, but it hits all the right notes. The crunch from the apple and fried jalape\u00f1os, the sweetness of the agave, the pickle punch. I wasn\u2019t at all sure about the corn, but I have to admit, it works. I had worried that the wasabi would take over, but it just pulls everything into harmony \u2026 almost. My one complaint is that occasionally the green peas pop up to undesirable prominence. If you don\u2019t love them, you could omit them or replace them with celery without altering the fundamental appeal of the recipe.",
      "As good as it was right away, after chilling for several hours, it was spectacular. I felt like the rat in Ratatouille, swooning in my kitchen. And yes, the apple was still pristine thanks to the lemon and vinegar, although the crispy jalape\u00f1os lost a bit of crunch. Consider adding those just before serving.",
      "I\u2019m tickled pink as David Wooderson\u2019s jeans with this tuna salad from my buddy, my pal, my old college chum Matthew McConaughey. I hope you head out on your own shopping trip, and if it\u2019s dinner for four, use two cans of tuna; I went back for seconds and then snuck a couple more bites later on. It\u2019s high-protein, heart-healthy if you go a little easy on the mayo, and contains both fruits and vegetables, so I\u2019m sold as a registered dietitian as well as a diner.",
      "Speaking of old buddies, now that I think of it, part of the charm of his tuna salad is that it echoes McConaughey\u2019s favorite role of mine, a lesser-known one as Deputy Buddy Deeds in \u201cLone Star\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s spicy salty, complex, terrifying at the outset and just the thing if you want to see deeply into the truth of what it means to be from here. Plus, despite early appearances, it all makes sense in the end.",
      "Except for the peas. I\u2019m just still not sure about those."

      "With the highly-anticipated musical now out in theaters, fans are no doubt already wondering when \u201cWicked\u201d will be available to stream at home.",
      "While a streaming date has not yet been announced, the film will likely land on Peacock, since it's distributed by Universal Pictures. (Peacock is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.) If this is the case, the Broadway adaptation could be available to stream as early as January, as Variety reported in 2021 that Universal films can premiere on Peacock as early as 45 days after their theatrical release date.",
      "However, some Universal movies take longer than 45 days to make their streaming debut.\u00a0The Universal film \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d for example, came out in theaters in July 2023 but did not premiere on Peacock until February 2024.",
      "In the meantime, \u201cWicked\u201d is enjoying strong numbers at the box office as it competes with Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II,\u201d in what some have dubbed the \u201cGlicked\u201d phenomenon, similar to the \"Barbenheimer\" craze.",
      "Both movies opened on Nov. 22 with strong numbers, but \u201cWicked\u201d beat out \u201cGladiator II,\u201d which opened at an estimated $55.5 million, according to CNBC.",

      "Before \u201cWicked\u201d opened, fans were debating online whether it would be appropriate to sing along in the theater to the movie\u2019s beloved songs, including \u201cPopular\u201d and \u201cDefying Gravity.\u201d",
      "Grande and Erivo weighed in on the sing-along debate in a recent interview with NBC News.",

    "story": [
      "While the rest of the world was waiting to see if Taylor Swift would make it to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas from her \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Tokyo to watch Travis Kelce, two women were invested in this year\u2019s game for a different reason.",
      "On Super Bowl Sunday, Samantha DiPippo,\u00a0Hallmark\u2019s senior vice president for programming, was at a watch party texting friends and fellow Hallmark executives.",
      "Their eyes were on the Kansas City Chiefs, a centerpiece of the NFL season if not for a star player\u2019s new courtship with the world\u2019s biggest pop performer, then for entering their fourth Super Bowl in five seasons. Those folks at Hallmark, a mainstay for romance lovers, had some ideas. Could another Lombardi Trophy for the Chiefs help bring those ideas to fruition?",
      "They were about to see \u2014 and the game was a nail-biter. The San Francisco 49ers held on to an early lead, 10-3, going into halftime. After Kansas City pulled ahead in the third quarter, the score was tied 19-19 by the fourth, sending the championship game into overtime.",
      "DiPippo\u2019s phone was blowing up with messages from her team. Then, thanks to the \u201cpower of the Chiefs,\u201d and, she says, \u201ca little bit of magic,\u201d Kansas City won 25-22 after a touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Mecole Hardman.",
      "\u201cCandice (DiLavore, senior manager at Hallmark) and I are just texting back and forth thinking, \u2018I hope this happens. I hope this happens,\u2019\u201d DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cAs it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "The answer to that question became a resounding yes. That movie is Hallmark\u2019s \u201cHoliday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story,\u201d premiering on the network Nov. 30. The film was shot over a period of about 15 days on location in Kansas City, including three days at Arrowhead Stadium.",
      "As it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hallmark executive Samantha DiPippo",
      "TODAY visited the set of the film in July to meet the stars and see Jenna Bush Hager make her film debut with a cameo. This was all while witnessing firsthand the hundreds of extras, dozens of Christmas trees and four football fields worth of lights to make, in the words of DiPippo, \u201cthe largest movie that Hallmark Channel\u2019s ever done.\u201d",
      "A match made in Hallmark heaven",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was announced in June as part of Hallmark\u2019s 2024 \u201cCountdown to Christmas\u201d lineup, which included a new partnership between the Chiefs and Hallmark.",
      "You\u2019re forgiven if you thought this movie would follow the true-to-life plot laid out by Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s romance, though.",
      "For the uninitiated, the Swift-Kelce timeline looks like this: In September 2023, Swift attended a Chiefs home game after rumors that Swift and tight end Travis Kelce were an item. Kelce notably had attended her \u201cEras Tour\u201d show in Kansas City just months before, and after the concert, used his podcast to tell the world that he tried (and failed) to give Swift his number.",
      "The rest, as many know, is history.",
      "Though Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s story produced an audience with an appetite for more football romance, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d isn\u2019t about a player and a pop star (Lifetime has that movie); this follows a Chiefs employee and an NFL super fan.",
      "The screenwriter of \u201cHoliday Touchdown,\u201d Julie Sherman Wolfe, who\u2019s written more than 20 films for Hallmark, says she\u2019s always wanted to write \u201ca big football movie.\u201d The offer for this project came just a week after the Super Bowl, when her team, the 49ers, experienced that crushing defeat.",
      "When tackling the script, Wolfe says she leaned into her own family\u2019s unique superstitions and traditions.",
      "\u201cIt really was coming from a place in my heart about what we love the most about the game. I guess I would love people to know that you don\u2019t have to be a Chiefs fan to enjoy this movie,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThe Chiefs are in the movie, and it is about them, but it\u2019s about more than that. It\u2019s about things that are bigger than a team. It\u2019s about your team.\u201d",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d first introduces Alana (Hunter King) and her family of Chiefs super fans who run a merch store. In comes Derrick (Tyler Hynes), who\u2019s in charge of fan engagement for the Chiefs and oversees the annual fan of the year contest (which is real, by the way). Alana\u2019s family is, of course, in the running.",
      "Though Wolfe says one doesn\u2019t have to love the Chiefs to appreciate the movie, its cameos will elate those who do: NFL mom Donna Kelce, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis all appear.",
      "The film even took inspiration from a real job in the Chiefs org. Jayne Martin has been the vice president of fan experience for 23 seasons. She says she is \u201cbridging the gap between the team and our fans.\u201d",
      "In March, Wolfe spoke with Martin to go over the premise of the storyline. They touched on Martin\u2019s job responsibilities and walked through potential scenarios that the film\u2019s leading man might encounter.",
      "\u201cIt was very important for (Wolfe) to ensure that the narrative was realistic,\u201d Martin says.",
      "Wolfe also brought aspects of her own football fandom to the plot. Alana\u2019s last name, Higman, came from her friend\u2019s maiden name, in honor of her family of Chiefs fans. Derrick\u2019s last name meanwhile is Young \u2014 a nod to the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl competitors.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s for Steve Young from the 49ers,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cI had to put something in there.\u201d",
      "Then there\u2019s the Higmans\u2019 lucky Chiefs hat, which drives a subplot. Alana\u2019s family has a superstition: The Chiefs only go to the Super Bowl when that old beanie is worn by a family member on Christmas. Derrick doesn\u2019t believe it though \u2014 so when the hat goes missing, things go awry.",
      "Originally, Wolfe\u2019s draft referenced a vintage Chiefs baseball hat. After they sent a couple pages of the script to the Chiefs, DiPippo recalls one of the team\u2019s executives saying, \u201cI\u2019m reading this, and I\u2019m just thinking of my grandpa. My grandfather had a vintage Chiefs winter hat, and he would wear it all the time while he was shoveling snow, and that\u2019s my memory of him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading it, I\u2019m in my kitchen crying, and I text one of our other execs, and I said, \u2018It\u2019s a winter hat now, it\u2019s a winter hat now!\u2019\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "The Taylor Swift of it all",
      "It\u2019s undeniable that NFL experienced in 2023 season what has been dubbed the \u201cTaylor Swift effect,\u201d or the increase in exposure and female audience that follows the famous singer.",
      "\u201cThe magic, the romance of the Taylor Swift and Kelce union really got people in that romance mood \u2014 and romance plus football, right?\u201d Wolfe says.",
      "Exactly. For Hallmark, project ideas really started flowing in December 2023, after a pair of commercials leaned into just that.",
      "The first was a Hallmark ad, which aired Christmas Day on ESPN and stars Wolfe herself. In it, she sits at her computer as if typing a screenplay and lists the many ways the 2023 NFL season played out like a Hallmark movie, from \u201cincredible stories\u201d to \u201cunexpected romance.\u201d",
      "Then in January, the Chiefs released a postseason commercial titled \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which is framed as a spoof trailer for a Hallmark-esque film about a diehard NFL fan who works at a Chiefs gift shop. (Sound familiar?) Hynes plays that fan, and Donna Kelce notably makes a cameo.",
      "DiPippo says the ESPN ad was a \u201cgreat catalyst\u201d to \u201cHoliday Touchdown.\u201d Then \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which she calls a \u201clittle bit of a love letter to Hallmark,\u201d helped inspire the premise of the movie.",
      "Hynes says that when the Chiefs approached him for the \u201cFalling for Football\u201d commercial, it felt a little more \u201ctongue in cheek.\u201d But starring in \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d required him to treat the type of film spoofed in the commercial with integrity.",
      "\u201cThis is a legitimate Hallmark movie that is filled with all the heart, sincerity, warmth and joy that these movies always have,\u201d says Hynes, who has been in more than 15 Hallmark films, including six in the 2024 season.",
      "Martin says Chiefs fan demographics have changed since Swift first appeared at Arrowhead Stadium and is now about 57% female. \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d is an example of an attempt to reach and engage that new audience with the Chiefs and the NFL as a whole, Martin says.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened.\u201d",
      "Screenwriter Julie Sherman Wolfe",
      "Though DiPippo believes Hallmark\u2019s partnership with the Chiefs could have happened without Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s 100% a pure Hallmark movie at heart,\u201d she says \u2014 Wolfe believes\u00a0a little of fate was still at play.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened. It was meant to be,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThey got the right people and the right time and Travis and Taylor, and everything happened the way it was meant to happen for this movie.\u201d",
      "Christmas in July",
      "While \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d strays from the Travis Kelce-Swift relationship, being part of the film is surreal for star Hunter King, who identifies as a Swiftie and has her own \u201cinvisible string\u201d connection to it all.",
      "Kelce and Swift\u2019s storybook romance notably started after he attended an \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Kansas City. On July 7, King attended a Kansas City show with her sister, actor Joey King, who appeared in Swift\u2019s \u201cMean\u201d music video in 2011, then in \u201cI Can See You\u201d almost 13 years later. At that July 7 concert, Joey King joined Swift onstage.",
      "\u201cThe day that we started filming I think was almost exactly a year later,\u201d Hunter King says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Wait a second. It really is a full circle moment for me.\u2019\u201d",
      "The production kicked off shrouded in secrecy. Casting was \u201cincredibly difficult,\u201d DiPippo says, because they couldn\u2019t share many details about the project, and \u201ceverything had NDAs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the most secretive we\u2019ve ever had to be on any project,\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "So when production started up around Kansas City in July, it drew a crowd. In addition to Arrowhead Stadium, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was filmed in the suburb of Independence, Missouri. The local pizzeria Square Pizza was transformed into a fictional barbecue restaurant called Norma & Nic\u2019s, managed by Donna Kelce\u2019s character. Inside, garlands with red ornaments bordered the ordering counter. Chiefs memorabilia hung on the walls, and wreaths decorated every door.",
      "The entire production involved about two dozen Christmas trees used in rotation \u2014 including 18 used in one day \u2014 as well as more than 400 yards of lights of \u201cevery color ornament bulb you can imagine,\u201d according to Daniel King, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u2019s\u201d production designer.",
      "Most behind the scenes were met with challenges, like set decorator Christi Whiteley, who was in charge of decorating and re-decorating up to 20 trees over the course of a few days, and property master Hunter Nelson, who made sure edible props like holiday meals and gingerbread houses were preserved at certain temperatures.",
      "And speaking of temperatures \u2014 the July heat was a hurdle for everyone.",
      "At Arrowhead, about 1,000 extras filmed inside the stadium, wearing parkas, scarves and other winter gear as the temperature reached 99 degrees, though felt more like 102, according to the Weather app.",
      "Hunter King filmed the Arrowhead Stadium scenes with an ice pack in her pants, a neck fan and an undershirt fan. On a discomfort scale of 1 to 10, Hunter King says filming in the sun felt like a 9.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s mostly the sweaters and then the coat over it, and in this heat and in the humidity, that\u2019s what really, really cranks it up a notch,\u201d she says.",
      "The heat didn\u2019t deter fans, though. At one point, while filming in Independence, there were about 70 people watching and standing in the sun, DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cThey were coming in Chiefs gear. There were kids, there were grandparents. It was just so cute to see how excited they were just because we\u2019re filming in their town,\u201d she says.",
      "TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager, who makes a cameo as a sports journalist, wore a heavy wool coat paired with a sweater-like tank top and white trousers. While rehearsing her scene on the field of Arrowhead, crew members held up umbrellas for the actors. One of the director\u2019s last calls before \u201caction\u201d was the cue to put on jackets. The first thing each actor did after hearing \u201ccut\u201d was rip those coats off.",
      "Chiefs players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis appear in the film during a game scene, so they got to dress in their Chiefs uniforms.",
      "And luckily for Andy Reid, the head coach\u2019s cameo only took about 15 minutes to film.",
      "Before he left Arrowhead after delivering his lines, Reid told Jenna that he never would have imagined his stadium as the setting for not one, but now two love stories.",
      "He adds, \u201cWhere we\u2019re at in today\u2019s world, this is a healthy thing.\u201d"

      "A new three-part Netflix documentary series, \u201cCold Case: Who Killed JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey\u201d examines how the actions of law enforcement and the media at the time may have influenced the investigation.",
      "Tips and leads have emerged in the case over the years, and experts are still piecing them together in the hopes of solving her murder.",
      "\u201cI believe this crime can be solved,\u201d Joe Berlinger, the documentary\u2019s director, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Berlinger says he created the documentary partly to \u201cput some pressure\u201d on police to reexamine evidence from the original crime scene using today\u2019s more advanced DNA testing technology.",
      "\u201cThere were items that were tested, but the DNA technology back then was so primitive that it\u2019s time to retest those items,\u201d he says.",
      "Berlinger also says that in his view, the evidence presented in the documentary suggests that an outside intruder, not JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey\u2019s parents, committed the crime.",
      "\u201cThere is a disturbing amount of people in my mind who clinging to this theory that the Ramseys did it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I just hope that my reporting is so rock solid that I will change some hearts and minds on this subject.\u201d",
      "In December 2023, the Boulder Police Department brought together the Colorado Cold Case Review Team to examine the original homicide investigation.",
      "\u201cOne focus of the new investigation is DNA testing. While forensic testing was available in 1996, the science behind DNA testing continues to rapidly evolve,\u201d Boulder police said in a 2023 release, adding they are \u201cworking with leading DNA experts from across the county to ensure the latest forensic techniques are used to analyze remaining DNA samples.\u201d",
      "The review team also digitized and consolidated all the evidence collected over the years in the case, including more than 21,000 tips, more than 1,000 interviews, and samples of DNA, fingerprints, shoeprints and handwriting from more than 200 people, per the 2023 release.",
      "\u201cThe overarching goal is to look at the facts and evidence with fresh eyes and an open mind, armed with the latest developments in forensic science,\u201d Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said in the release.",
      "While the identity of her killer, or killers, remains to be discovered, certain facts about the circumstances of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey\u2019s death are known, including her cause of death and the details of the injuries she suffered the night of Dec. 26, 1996.",
      "Read on to learn more about what happened to JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, according to her autopsy.",
      "What does JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey\u2019s autopsy say?",
      "JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey\u2019s cause of death was \u201casphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma,\u201d according to an autopsy released by the Office of the Boulder County Coroner on Dec. 27, 1996.",
      "According to the autopsy, she suffered from ligature strangulation and had a deep ligature furrow, or an indentation from something being tied, reaching all the way around her neck. There was also a ligature around her right wrist.",

      "JonBen\u00e9t also had a scalp contusion, or bruise, as well as a fracture on the right side of her skull.",
      "Other head injuries included subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage, which are both types of bleeding in the brain, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "In addition, the autopsy notes abrasions on her right cheek, right shoulder, left lower back, and left lower leg.",
      "The autopsy also notes an \u201carea of abrasion\u201d involving the \u201chymen and distal right lateral vaginal wall,\u201d as well as a \u201csmall amount of dried blood\u201d on parts of the perineum and labia majora.",
      "The report notes additionally that a toxicologic screening detected no drugs or ethanol in her blood.",
      "What else did her autopsy find?",
      "JonBen\u00e9t was first examined at the Ramsey\u2019s home by pathologist John E. Meyer on the night she was murdered on Dec. 26.",
      "\u201cI initially viewed the body in the living room of the house,\u201d Meyer wrote in the autopsy. \u201cThe decedent was laying on her back on the floor, covered by a blanket and a Colorado Avalanche sweatshirt. On removing these two items from the top of the body the decedent was found to be lying on her back with her arms extended up over her head.\u201d",
      "He noted that Ramsey was just under four feet tall and weighed an estimated 45 pounds.",
      "The autopsy also noted that she was found wearing a yellow bracelet with the name \u201cJonBen\u00e9t\u201d on one side and the date \u201c12/25/96\u201d on the other side. She also had a \u201cred ink line drawing in the form of a heart\u201d located on her left palm.",

      "Yang, who\u2019s worked on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d since 2018, says he was \u201creally hesitant\u201d to see the film. In \u201cWicked,\u201d Yang plays Pfannee (pronounced \u201cfanny\u201d), a student at Shiz University and one of Glinda\u2019s (Ariana Grande) friends \u2014\u00a0or, as Yang puts it, Glinda\u2019s \u201cpublicists.\u201d",

      "\u201cI was so nervous. I was terrified, because it was a long, really tough time, just to juggle both at the same time,\u201d he adds.",
      "Then, he thought of his first time visiting New York City.",
      "\u201cI begged my parents to go to the Gerswhin (Theatre, home of \u201cWicked\u201d). We couldn\u2019t afford tickets, but I was like, \u2018Can I at least go so I can press my face up against the glass?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe same day, we went two avenues over to Rockefeller Center to go do the NBC Studios tour. We picked the TODAY show, we went to Conan, and then we went to \u2018SNL.\u2019\u201d",
      "Now, seeing \u201cWicked\u201d as a member of the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast felt \u201cfull circle,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect way to close that loop, like I have to see it with \u2018SNL\u2019 people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the perfect way to do it. I\u2019m so glad I did it that way.\u201d",
      "As for any notable reactions from his castmates?",
      "\u201cSarah Sherman was there, and she sobbed the entire movie. Just to watch her cry with joy and being emotional about things is my favorite thing. She\u2019s the emotional, validating force in my life,\u201d he says.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Yang shares his thoughts on the \u201cWicked\u201d set, discusses all those Glicked (\u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d) memes and, in true \u201cLas Culturistas\u201d fashion, his rules for Ozian culture.",
      "This interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "Most surprising, shocking set moment was, I think just walking into Shiz (University) the first day. Like every single person was awestruck. Even the people who were on the crew who had worked on like every Marvel movie, all the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d movies and like, every other big blockbuster, was like, \u2018We\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u2019 So it just blew everyone\u2019s expectations out of the water.",
      "But then the most shocking single moment was \u2014 there's a giant sculpted face of Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard that I'm sure you know what I'm talking about in the movie. And Ari (Ariana Grande) and I were just walking around set one day, just like having a little walk about, and then we just popped up on it, and it really gave us a jump scare. But it\u2019s just because he\u2019s so striking and handsome, of course.",
      "That's Jeff Goldblum. I think it's the first time you ever see him in the movie. It's really amazing. It's quite \u2014 it leaves an impression.",
      "Yeah, it felt like a Sleep No More immersive theater experience. You just walked around and like, it felt so intimate. It felt we were at school, just in the quad, just walking around.",
      "Definitely. All of us were like, within these social dynamics of being at school. It felt very freshmen orientation-y because it was like, we're in a classroom together. Seating arrangement was very intentional. I think it accelerated familiarity with everybody.",
      "First person I met when I got to rehearsals was Ari. Yeah, it was really special. It was Ari, and then it was Bronwyn James, who plays Shenshen, my other half, my other extension.",
      "We would have wine nights after shoots, especially when we were shooting remotely out in the countryside. The Shiz campus was like, all the way outside of London. And so they put us up in this place where we would just like, have a little night cap. And it was just a really tasteful adult thing. And then we would all go to bed and show up to work the next morning. It just felt like an adult summer camp.",
      "I\u2019ve been obsessed with it. Cynthia (Erivo) and I have the same thing where we didn\u2019t see it until much later in our lives, but we knew the songs and the story, obviously... If you were in a drama club in the aughts, it was just the thing, like you lived and breathed it.",
      "I just remember going to the library and renting out the original Broadway cast recording and flipping through the booklet \u2014 remember those? And just seeing pictures of Idina (Menzel, the original Elphaba) and Kristin (Chenoweth, the original Glinda). I was like, something has changed within me. I was like, this is the best, this is the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.",
      "Pfannee's vibe. There's a moment where Pfannee and Shenshen run up to Galinda when she gets off the boat at Shiz that you might see in an extended version of the film. But they are just there to rekindle this friendship with Galinda that they've had since they were kids.",
      "That's background, that's not totally necessary, but I think, what's really interesting about them as characters is that they see and they operate on status. They see Galinda, and they're like, she's someone that we can, like, glom onto.",
      "We talked about them early on and Jon (M. Chu) was like, \"I don't think these are the lackeys, or like the snickering best friends. I think there's something more to them.\" And we were like, \"Yeah, what is it?\" I think what we landed on was that they are kind of Galinda's publicists.",
      "Ari was very protective of Galinda not being the one to enact the bullying, she\u2019s good. And so it falls on these two characters to be the nefarious ones. We\u2019re the ones who give her the hat and are like, \u2018You know who should wear this? Elphaba.\u2019\u201d",
      "We're just protecting our client! Exactly.",
      "I think the star of the internet discourse of \u201cWicked\u201d is that little flying squirrel that plays the drums at the Ozdust. That little diva.",
      "He was on set, and he was a real charmer. I think everybody had a moment with him in private, and it was very steamy \u2014\u00a0No! We didn't have any (animals).",
      "Barbenheimer (\u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d) is such a perfect portmanteau. Glicked... I don\u2019t know.",
      "Glad \u2014\u00a0Gladwick. I like Gladwick.",
      "Gladwick's cute. It sounds like a candle you buy a target. Gladwick.",
      "Oh yeah, we're so excited. This is the perfect time of year to do a double feature. You've totally got nothing but time, hopefully.",
      "I think \u201cGladiator II\u201d is going to be slightly more intense, maybe more of an emotional drain, perhaps. It\u2019s going to be very, I think, quite violent.",
      "And I think our movie is a cute salve to put over that wound. Yeah, maybe watch \u201cWicked\u201d after \u201cGladiator.\u201d",
      "The rules of Ozian culture are: The train to the Emerald City is too small. That's rule of culture No. 7.",
      "Rule of Ozian culture No. 61 is animals know how to party better than humans do. That's why they're at the Ozdust.",
      "And rule of Ozian culture No. 4 is Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) is unfortunately a style icon, even though she's a villain.",
      "Look, everyone\u2019s like, \u2018This is the longest intermission ever.\u2019 It needs to be that because a lot of time passes between the acts.",
      "A lot happens right when we pick up. Galinda is in this very front-facing position. Pfannee and Shenshen are at her side still, but a lot is in motion. The world has literally changed, and the landscape of it is very different. There is this campaign against this one person that they're like, the reason for all the problems in the world.",
      "The story is so flexible how it relates to our real world, but I think, it's going to be interesting to see it \u2014",
      "(Editor\u2019s note: Paul Mescal, star of \u201cGladiator II,\u201d stopped to say hello to Yang in the TODAY green room.)",
      "And a lot has shifted in the topography of things. But yeah it needs that, because if you go straight from \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d to what happens in Act 2, it just feels like too much of a lurch."

      "Menzel and Chenoweth\u2019s cameo occurs toward the end of the film, during Glinda and Elphaba\u2019s memorable duet, \u201cOne Short Day,\u201d which follows the friends as they visit the Emerald City for the first time to meet the Wizard.",
      "During the song, Elphaba and Glinda stop for a spectacle called Wizomania, which gives a glossy and glittery retelling of how the Wizard managed to take power in Oz.",
      "That moment is expanded on in the 2024 film with a new song and dance performed by two members of an Emerald City theater troupe playing Oz's Wise Ones.",
      "The two Wise Ones are played by Menzel and Chenoweth. Each gets their moment in the spotlight and sings about a prophecy involving the Grimmerie, a spell book.",
      "According to the song, the Wise Ones wrote down their spells in the Grimmerie using a \"strange and secret language.\" But a prophecy foretells that after their deaths, in \"Oz's darkest hour,\" a powerful figure will lead Oz, distinguishable by their ability to read the Grimmerie.",
      "By the end of the Wise Ones\u2019 song, that figure is revealed to be the Wizard of Oz (though the ending of \u201cWicked: Part 1\u201d calls his authenticity into question).",
      "At the end of the cameo, Chenoweth and Menzel stand next to Grande and Erivo, respectively, and look affectionately at the actors playing the role they originated. Menzel even fixes the hat Erivo wears as Elphaba.",
      "Schwartz tells TODAY.com that they had \u201call sorts of ideas\u201d about how Chenoweth and Menzel could be in the film.",
      "\u201cWe wanted, obviously, to honor Kristin and Idina by having them be in the movie,\u201d he says.",
      "Some of those ideas were Chenoweth playing Glinda\u2019s mother, or Chenoweth and Menzel appearing as teachers at Shiz University, the fictional college where Glinda and Elphaba meet.",
      "At the same time, Schwartz and Winnie Holzman, who wrote the book for the \u201cWicked\u201d musical and the screenplay for the 2024 film, were working on expanding the song \"One Short Day\u201d already.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to expand \u2018One Short Day\u2019 to show more of the propaganda that the Wizard was disseminating and really understand better this magic book \u2014 the Grimmerie, what is that? Because it figures so significantly in the plot,\u201d Schwartz says.",
      "It was none other than director Jon M. Chu who connected the dots between Menzel and Chenoweth and the \u201cOne Short Day\u201d expansion, Schwartz says.",
      "\u201c\u2018Why don\u2019t we just make them two wise women of Oz, and it can be Kristin and Idina?\u2019\u201d Schwartz recalls Chu saying.",
      "\u201cAnd then of course we were able to tailor the number to have Easter egg tributes to their performances in the show,\u201d Schwartz adds.",
      "Easter eggs within an Easter egg",
      "In addition to recognizing Chenoweth and Menzel, fans of \u201cWicked\u201d will also likely clock certain moments of their performance as winks to their legacies as Glinda and Elphaba.",
      "During the vocal arrangement written for them, both Menzel and Chenoweth hit some of their signature notes. Menzel sings the signature \u201cOh!\u201d riff heard at the very end of \u201cDefying Gravity.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, \u201cKristin has to do her soprano,\u201d Schwartz says. \u201cShe hits a high D flat.\u201d",
      "The two Wise Ones also seem to have a bit of a rivalry, which \u201csatirizes the press at the time when they tried to make (Chenoweth and Menzel) into rivals,\u201d Schwartz adds. (For a bit of \u201cWicked\u201d history, both Menzel and Chenoweth were nominated for best performance by a leading actress in a musical at the 2004 Tonys, which Menzel won.)",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a wonderful moment where Ariana is about to hit a high note, and Kristin puts her hand over her mouth,\u201d Schwartz adds.",
      "The whole number is \u201cone big Easter egg,\u201d Schwartz says.",
      "Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman's cameos in 'Wicked'",
      "Schwartz and Holzman even make an appearance in the scene.",
      "Holzman appears in the scene as one of the citizens of the Emerald City watching the Wizomania performance. Toward the end of the Wise Ones' song, an image of the Wizard landing in Oz and seemingly reading the Grimmerie plays out in the sky.",
      "Holzman's character points up at the image and says, \"He can read it. He must be... a Wizard!\"",
      "Then, at the very end of \"One Short Day,\" Schwartz appears as one of the Wizard's palace guards. When Elphaba and Glinda show their invitation, Schwartz's character squints down at the piece of paper from a watchtower. He breaks out in a smile and memorably shouts, \"The Wizard will see you now!\"",
      "Filming \u201cOne Short Day\u201d and being part of a scene that had Chenoweth, Grande, Menzel and Erivo all together was \u201cemotional,\u201d Holzman says.",
      "\u201cIt was that kind of, \u2018Pinch me, is this really happening?\u2019\u201d Holzman says. \u201cThose four women are very extraordinary women and artists and they all really admire and respect each other deeply.\u201d"

      "Connie Nielsen, who plays Lucilla in the original film and in the sequel, spoke to TODAY's Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager alongside Mescal on Nov. 22 about returning to the role, more than two decades after the first movie was released.",
      "\u201cIt was magic, it was moving, it was so strange. It was a little bit like coming home to something,\u201d Nielson said. \u201cAnd at the same time, I wasn\u2019t going back in time \u2014 I was where Lucilla would have been, 20 years later in her life, and telling that story about what happened to her.\u201d",

      "How does \u2018Gladiator II\u2019 begin?",
      "In the sequel, a now-adult Lucius is taken prisoner after Acacius takes siege over the city he was taken to as a child, years after Lucius\u2019 mother dispelled him from Rome over concerns for his safety once his father Maximus was killed in the first film.",
      "After being captured, Lucius and several other prisoners are sent into the Colosseum where they are forced to fend off a pack of feral baboons \u2014 or die.",
      "\u201cThat sequence is absolutely insane, almost unfathomable when you see it,\u201d Mescal said, according to the film\u2019s press notes. \u201cHe is taken prisoner and dragged into Rome. He has an intense anger towards everything Roman that will grow as the film progresses.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen he enters the arena for the first time, he sees Acacius, the\u00a0 general who led the siege of his city and was responsible for killing his wife. He sees him sitting there with his\u00a0own wife and he vows to himself to kill them or be killed,\u201d Mescal continues.",
      "Lucius soon realizes the heavy implication of that vow. Acacius' wife, played by Connie Nielsen, is his mother \u2014 and no one appears to remember his true identity.",
      "Lucius' performance against the baboons in the Colosseum catches the attention of Denzel Washington\u2019s character Macrinus, who teases Lucius with an opportunity at freedom and a chance to face Acacius.",
      "But before those things can happen, Macrinus, an astute Roman businessman with great wealth and connections across the empire, forces Lucius to become his gladiator in order to repay him and earn his freedom.",
      "Viewers soon find out that Macrinus has ulterior motives \u2014 including toppling the twin emperors Geta and Caracalla, played by Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger, respectively.",
      "\u201cLucius is a natural-born leader and a great fighter, which makes him useful in many ways. But pure rage is not a tool; it\u2019s a disadvantage. Macrinus never wants to lose control. He doesn\u2019t want to be the emperor. He wants to control the emperor,\u201d Washington said, according to the press notes.",
      "\u201cAnd power is an addictive drug. Once you have it, you can\u2019t live without it. Once he had a taste for taking, he had to have more. He doesn\u2019t really care about anyone. He uses them. If people can\u2019t make him more powerful, he has no interest in them,\u201d he added.",
      "How does \u2018Gladiator II\u2019 end?",
      "An attempted coup led by Acacius marks the beginning of the end in \u201cGladiator II.\u201d",
      "Pascal notes that Acacius\u2019 allegiances in film are strategic.",
      "\u201cBecause he is leading the Roman army, you\u2019ll think he\u2019s a villain,\u201d Pascal said of his character in the film\u2019s press notes. \u201cBut Acacius loves Lucilla, a beloved character from the first movie. So, then he\u2019s a good guy. And the movie plays those tricks on us continually.\u201d",
      "Acacius attempts to take over the government from the twin emperors, but Macrinus learns of his plan through his connections throughout the empire and thwarts it.",
      "The general is then thrown into the Colosseum as punishment and ordered to fight Lucius in front of the emperors and scores of Roman citizens. Though Lucius has previously vowed to kill Acacius to avenge the killing of his wife, he ultimately decides not to kill him in the arena, which angers Geta and Caracalla.",
      "The emperors order for the guards to kill Acacius, and several soldiers shoot him to death with arrows sent flying from across the arena. The crowd hates the decision \u2014 hinting at another uprising.",
      "The death of Acacius destabilizes the emperors\u2019 reign, which Macrinus capitalizes on. He begins plotting to turn the twin brothers against each other, and focuses on Caracalla\u2019s insecurity as the weaker leader. He convinces him to kill his own brother, and during the murder, Macrinus even helps him cut off Geta\u2019s head.",
      "An obvious nod to his instability, Caracalla appoints his pet monkey as first consul, but appoints Macrinus as his second consul, giving the businessman sweeping authority over the empire.",
      "Meanwhile, Lucius hears that his mother is set to be executed for her role in the attempted coup and decides to finally accept his destiny as a leader in Rome.",
      "He sends a messenger (along with a ring belonging to his father given to him by Lucilla) to a group of Acacius\u2019 soldiers gathered outside of Rome. His plan? To rally his fellow gladiators to try to stop his mother\u2019s execution and use the Acacius' soldiers to take back the city.",
      "As Lucilla is brought out into the Colosseum\u00a0to be executed, the gladiators overpower the guards, but not before Macrinus manages to shoot Lucilla in the chest with an arrow. He then rides out of the Colosseum to gather his own army to fight against the Acacius\u2019 soldiers.",
      "Lucius chases him, and the pair face off in an epic battle on the outskirts of town with their two armies watching. Lucius wins the battle, cutting off Macrinus' arm and killing him in a river. He then gives an inspiring speech to the soldiers about rebuilding Rome, just as his father Maximus would have wanted.",
      "In the film's final scene, Lucius returns to the Colosseum and picks up some of the dirt, an obvious homage to the first film. A brief clip, which appears to be from the original film, then plays and shows a hand touching wheat in a field, a moment symbolic of one passing through to the afterlife.",
      "The screen then fades to black, leaving fans and viewers to wonder if there will be a third film in the \u201cGladiator\u201d universe."

      "\u201cI think all of that has a negative effect on the tourism sector of Cuba,\u201d added Diaz, who\u2019s critical of the country\u2019s government. \u201cAmericans are reminded that, yes, there is a dictatorship in Cuba. Yes, Cuba is a communist country.\u201d",
      "Stephanie Herchak, from Orr Lake, Canada and a frequent visitor to Cuba, recently returned from a trip despite travel advisories against going from Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, citing shortages, the effects of the storms and increased crime.",
      "Aware of the increasingly dire conditions, Herchak brought food and sanitary items to hand out to locals, though she didn\u2019t stray far from the resort where she was staying with her partner.",
      "\u201cAll the houses and things that we\u2019ve driven by are just shambles with no windows or anything, people with no power,\u201d she said.",
      "Herchak, who stayed at the Sanctuary by Grand Memories in Santa Maria, said she didn\u2019t experience power outages at the resort while she was there.\u00a0 In a phone call with NBC News, resort staff confirmed they have not had blackouts and use their \u201cown generators.\u201d",
      "But Herchak said she heard from many locals and hotel staff she spoke with that power was still out for hours at a time in residential areas.",
      "Reddit pages and several Facebook Cuba travel groups have become home to conversations on the situation in Cuba; some share concerns regarding upcoming trips and others share rare glimpses into current conditions, even encouraging visitors to reconsider their vacation.\u00a0Many ask for advice on which goods are most needed by locals.",
      "\u201cOver the last few years, more and more people who are going to Cuba are looking for ways to help,\u201d said Rebecca Shoval, program director for Not Just Tourists New York City, a volunteer effort that has connected underserved countries with hard to find resources for over 30 years. This year, they\u2019ve sent a \"record number\" of shipments to Cuba, according to the organization.",
      "Avi D'Souza, executive director of Not Just Tourists Toronto, said the organization has sent 475 suitcases of supplies this year \u2014 62% more than in 2023 and the majority of it to Cuba. In bulk, they've sent 298,000 lbs of medical supplies and equipment via container, 24% more than last year, he said.",
      "Shoval explained that tourists are given suitcases filled with medical supplies to bring to drop-off locations on the island.",
      "Anthony ImBoden, of Ontario, is one of many who expressed concerns and asked questions on a public Reddit forum regarding his upcoming vacation to Cuba. A diabetic whose insulin needs to be refrigerated, ImBoden asked for tips on how to travel with \u2014 and preserve \u2014 his medication through the power outages.",
      "Even though a Canadian travel advisory encourages visitors to \u201cexercise a high degree of caution in Cuba due to shortages of basic necessities including food, medicine and fuel,\" ImBoden said he\u2019s \u201ctaking [the concerns] with a grain of salt.\u201d",
      "While some people told him not to go, Imboden said his diabetes is well controlled and it\u2019s a risk he's \"willing to take.\u201d",
      "The Cuban government has blamed U.S. sanctions as well as the effect of the pandemic on tourism for the tougher economic conditions on the island, while the U.S. has blamed Cuba\u2019s centrally planned, communist economy. Cuba\u2019s lack of hard currency has affected its ability to import basic necessities.",
      "Recent travelers like Monica Joseph \u2014 who stayed at an Airbnb in  Cuba just before the massive outage \u2014 noted a feeling of safety in more tourist-centered areas like Havana, the capital. Though she did not experience blackouts herself, she did speak to many residents who described an inability to find goods like soap or sanitary products.",
      "Joseph, who lives near Washington, D.C., said she was told \u201cthat it was a bit better to be in the city\" but would have \"issues\" outside of Havana.",
      "The conditions outside of cities and tourist areas are a source of frustration for Cuban Americans like Mailen Rodr\u00edguez, 23, a kindergarten teacher from Houston who emigrated from Cuba when she was seven years old.",
      "\u201cIt was bad in 2007, but now it\u2019s even worse. \u2026 Back then, I don\u2019t ever remember sleeping without any light. Now, when I went in October, the [blackouts] were four to five hours every single day,\u201d Rodriguez said, asking why tourists aren\u2019t affected.",
      "\u201cWhy is it only affecting the people in the provinces that are scared to speak up and protest?\u201d",
      "The Cuban government didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on whether tourist areas are being given priority for electricity power and on countries' travel advisories warning of current conditions on the island.",
      "When Rodriguez visited Cuba in October, she brought her family basic necessities like toothpaste, toothbrushes, deodorant, shampoos, razors, clothing, shoes, and cooking seasonings \u2014 emphasizing that this was a luxury not afforded to many Cubans.",
      "\u201cThe people that have relatives over here, thankfully, they have a source of income, they have money for food, for any necessities,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t have family outside of the island, you\u2019re kind of stuck \u2014 it\u2019s really hard to get any resources.\u201d",
      "Carl Eaton, director of the Orange County California Chapter of Not Just Tourists, has become more aware of the needs in Cuba through his work.",
      "\u201cPeople who live in Cuba love Cuba, and they want to stay there because they love the island. However, a lot of people are reaching the end of the rope,\u201d Eaton said, mentioning that more people are trying to leave; the country has seen record migration out of Cuba.",
      "For tourists who want to help, \u201cCuba is probably one of the easiest countries in the world as far as aid warrants. They need the help, and they\u2019re not going to discourage anybody from bringing supplies into the country,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cThe big thing is to get through to the traveler that this is something that they can do, where they can make a difference.\u201d"

      "Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry said 66 people were wounded in the strikes, which were the fourth in central Beirut in less than a week.",
      "The escalation comes after U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein\u00a0traveled to the region\u00a0in pursuit of a deal to end\u00a0months of fighting\u00a0between Israel and Hezbollah that has erupted into full-on war.",
      "Israeli attacks have killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon, according to Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry.

      "Developing countries are seeking $1 trillion a year by the end of the decade, much of it from developed economies, to transition to green energy and adapt to extreme weather driven by climate change.",
      "As the World Meteorological Organization says 2024 is on track to be the hottest year on record, some experts are so worried they are calling for a completely new approach. In an open letter published last week, signatories including former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the whole framework of U.N. climate talks is \u201cno longer fit for purpose.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can choose to be proactive about climate, and the time for being proactive is rapidly shrinking,\u201d said Ruth Townend, a senior research fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House who attended the conference. \u201cOr we can choose to be reactive, which is much more expensive, much harder and has a higher human cost.\u201d",
      "Some of the highest human costs will be paid by smaller nations that are disproportionately affected by climate change, including Pacific Island nations whose existence is threatened by rising seas. But with COP29 weighed down by geopolitics and domestic turmoil, some were reluctant to attend at all.",
      "Deepening divides",
      "Top leaders from a number of major economies were notably absent in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.",
      "They included President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, leaders of the two biggest carbon emitters. Though British Prime Minister Keir Starmer did attend, most other leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries did not, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "While the bulk of the work happens among lower-level negotiators during long nights in windowless rooms, the presence of heads of state has symbolic value, Townend said.",
      "\u201cIt is really disappointing to see that world leaders haven\u2019t shown up in force in solidarity,\u201d she added.",
      "Despite his physical absence, one person whose presence has been felt here is Trump.",
      "U.S. officials have sought to reassure conference attendees after Trump\u2019s victory.",
      "While Trump \u201cmay put climate action on the back burner,\u201d U.S. climate envoy John Podesta said, \u201cthe work to contain climate change is going to continue.\u201d",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said states, cities, nongovernmental organizations and companies are still \u201call-in\u201d on pursuing climate goals. She also noted that 80% of the funding from Biden\u2019s two signature bills, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has gone to Republican districts including to promote the manufacturing of electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels.",
      "She said Trump could slow, but not stop, U.S. climate efforts.",
      "\u201cIt would be political malpractice to undo those opportunities when people are just now getting hired,\u201d Granholm told NBC News. Some 400,000 people have been hired because of the bills, she added.",
      "Even companies that stand to benefit from Trump\u2019s pledge to loosen restrictions on oil and gas exploration have expressed concern. Darren Woods, chief executive of Exxon, said he hoped the Trump administration would take a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d to reducing emissions and remain in the Paris Agreement.",
      "Meeting the goals under the agreement, which include keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial temperatures, could cost as much as $8 trillion annually, according to a report released last week by the Independent High Level Expert Group on Climate Finance.",
      "Who foots the bill?",
      "Nations that are highly affected by climate change despite being relatively small emitters themselves have grown frustrated with major polluting countries they see as shirking responsibility for helping them cover the costs and trying to hold back their development in the name of environmental protection.",
      "The host of the conference, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev, struck a tone of defiance in his keynote address, saying countries like his should not be castigated for exporting fossil fuels, especially by the U.S. and other wealthy nations that continue to rely on them.",
      "Aliyev and others whose countries have developed more recently, many of which were colonized by the West, say they should not be punished economically for the past emissions of wealthier nations.",
      "\u201cWho created this pollution that we have? It\u2019s 120 years of industrial revolution,\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s climate envoy, Adel Al-Jubeir, said.",
      "Lord Adair Turner of Britain, who chairs a global coalition known as the Energy Transitions Commission, said the Saudi climate envoy was living in a \u201cdiplomatic fantasy land.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor Saudi Arabia to say \u2014 with its level of per capita income \u2014 that it\u2019s a developing country is an insult to true developing countries like in sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe are going to have to have financial flows not just from rich developed countries in the classic sense in the G7, but also from the rich countries of the Middle East and indeed also from China.\u201d",
      "Though China industrialized later than many of the world\u2019s biggest polluters, analysts from the U.K.-based Carbon Brief said during the conference that China had surpassed the European Union as the world\u2019s second-biggest historical emitter after the United States.",
      "The infighting has only further exasperated Pacific Island nations such as Papua New Guinea, whose Prime Minister James Marape said in August that it would boycott the Baku conference as \u201ca protest at the big nations\u201d that continue emitting while balking at paying.",
      "Marape did eventually send a delegation under pressure from activists.",
      "Even as many world leaders skipped the conference or tried to, it also had first-time attendees from Taliban-led Afghanistan. Though the Taliban have struggled to gain international recognition over their rollback of women\u2019s rights and other abuses, Afghanistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change.",
      "The agriculture-reliant country has been pushed into a \u201cperil position,\u201d said Asadullah Jawid, an assistant professor at the American University of Afghanistan who has studied the effects of climate change on the country\u2019s farmers.",
      "\u201cDecades of war and instability, economic challenges, devastated infrastructure and an impoverished workforce have left Afghanistan with few resources for climate adaptation initiatives,\u201d he said.",
      "Dan Murphy reported from Baku, Azerbaijan, and Mithil Aggarwal from Hong Kong."

    "title": "Chess' future looms over the world championship, once again missing its biggest star",
    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 14:07:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The 2024 World Chess Championship is set to kick off this week, a showdown between 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju of India and reigning champion Ding Liren of China.",
    "story": [
      "One of the world\u2019s biggest sporting competitions got underway Monday morning, with reigning champion Ding Liren taking game 1 of the World Chess Championship against 18-year-old phenom Gukesh Dommaraju.",
      "While the world championship is still considered chess' marquee event, the absence of Norway\u2019s Magnus Carlsen, the five-time champion who declined to defend his title in 2022, looms large.",
      "Grandmaster David Howell, a close friend of Carlsen\u2019s who is also one of the official match commentators in Singapore, believes the world championship still holds a special place in the chess world, but said this year is unique.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, it\u2019s been the one thing that defines what has been otherwise quite a disorganized tournament system,\u201d Howell said. \u201cNormally, the world championship is very successful at finding and celebrating the best player in the world. It\u2019s still got a lot of prestige, but this year it\u2019s a bit of a strange one.\u201d",
      "In some ways, the $2.5 million showdown between Liren, a soft-spoken assassin from China, and Gukesh, an up-and-coming prodigy from India, should be the biggest world championship yet.",
      "A chess boom during the pandemic has made the game more popular than ever, but that surge of interest has mainly been felt online. Chess.com now boasts 190 million users worldwide, up from 51 million in January 2020. The world\u2019s biggest chess platform told NBC News that 1 in 10 Americans have an account. Chess.com is also busy organizing its own money-spinning tournaments, slowly encroaching on the game\u2019s governing body, the International Chess Federation, also known as FIDE.",
      "That\u2019s led to a growing discussion over whether the championship format \u2014 14 games that often last more than three hours each \u2014 still works for a game that is often embracing quicker matches.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big debate over whether it needs to be modernized, or whether it\u2019s still the most efficient way of finding the best player in the world,\u201d Howell said. \u201cI still think it does a fantastic job at that. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that the world No. 1 has stepped aside.\u201d",
      "The legacy of Magnus Carlsen",
      "Carlsen, who has dominated the chess world for over a decade, vacated the title in 2022, citing a lack of motivation. While Ding technically succeeded Carlsen, the Norwegian remains the consensus best player in the world and the sport\u2019s most marketable figure.",
      "Known as the \u201cGOAT\u201d (a popular acronym for the \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d), Carlsen has been a towering presence in chess since his teenage years. His last title defense, a dramatic series against Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021, drew record-breaking online audiences. At the height of the chess boom fueled by the pandemic and Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d Carlsen seemed poised to turn chess into a mainstream spectator sport.",
      "However, in 2022 Carlsen\u2019s image took a hit when he was drawn into a cheating scandal. Carlsen implied grandmaster Hans Niemann, then a teenager and one of the game\u2019s rising young stars, cheated when he beat him at the Sinquefield Cup. It led to a $100 million lawsuit before the players settled in August last year and said they had moved on from their rift. The terms of the settlement have not been made public.",
      "Howell noted that it\u2019s not particularly rare for the world chess championship to be without the game\u2019s top player.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s happened throughout history,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been several cases of a player being world champion, but maybe not being the strongest on paper. Thinking back, there was Max Euwe, maybe [Vasily] Smyslov, [Tigran] Petrosian and then [Vladimir] Kramnik later on. They weren\u2019t the No. 1 at the time, but they were the world champion.\u201d",
      "The stakes for Ding and Gukesh",
      "Beyond Carlsen\u2019s absence, the game of chess and its upcoming championship also face some broader challenges, including geopolitical tensions and questions about the form of one of the competitors.",
      "The most immediate challenge is Ding. The reigning champ is a move-calculating machine. But as he prepares for the biggest test of his career, Ding has at times looked badly out of sorts.",
      "Ding claimed the championship in 2023 after a dramatic match against Nepomniachtchi. The series was tied 7-7 after three weeks, with Ding recovering from a terrible start to clinch a comeback victory. It was a proud moment for China and affirmed its status as a chess superpower. But since then, the 32-year-old\u2019s form has gone from bad to worse.",
      "After taking a nine-month break, Ding returned to competition with disappointing results. His performance at Norway Chess in June was particularly alarming after he lost four games in a row \u2014 an unprecedented showing for a world champion. Ding has looked anxious at times, and his results have seen him slump to world No. 23 in the latest FIDE rankings.",
      "Ding admitted to mental health challenges, revealing how self-doubt and anxiety have affected his game.",
      "Facing Ding in this year\u2019s championship is Gukesh, a prodigy aiming to become the youngest world champion in history. Gukesh represents a new wave of Indian talent inspired by Viswanathan Anand, India\u2019s first world champion, who won the title in 2007 to break Russia\u2019s stranglehold over the sport.",
      "In stark contrast to Ding\u2019s struggles, Gukesh has been in serene form. In September, he led India to its first-ever team gold at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, scoring an impressive 9/10. Currently ranked 18 places above Ding, Gukesh has overtaken his rival as the favorite.",
      "Politics and power struggles",
      "Adding to the intrigue is the championship\u2019s political backdrop. Chess likes to present itself as a major world sport, but it remains one of the few still dominated by Russian leadership. FIDE, the international chess federation, is headed by Arkady Dvorkovich, a former Russian deputy prime minister.",
      "Despite global sanctions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, FIDE has retained strong ties to Moscow, fueling criticism that the game is a tool of Russian soft power.",
      "Russia\u2019s influence on chess is long-standing. For decades, Soviet and Russian players dominated the world championship, with only a few exceptions like Bobby Fischer and Anand breaking the mold. This year, however, there are no Russian contenders in the final, a rarity that underscores the shifting landscape of global chess. Nepomniachtchi is the sole Russian in the top 10.",
      "Howell points to \u201ca clear shift\u201d over the past 10 years away from Russia and toward China and India.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how many resources are going into chess in China. It\u2019s very much a mystery. But in India, a huge amount of government support and sponsorship is funding chess. It\u2019s not a coincidence that there\u2019s a golden generation emerging right now. So in terms of dominance, India seems to be the new Russia.",
      "\u201cThis is the battle of Asia,\u201d Howell added. \u201cIt is the two superpowers, India and China, battling it out. They\u2019re not going to be the first Asian world champions, but it\u2019s still huge for growing the game in India, which is probably the biggest chess economy right now.\u201d",
      "The 14-game match will run until Dec. 12 (or 13 if tiebreaks are needed). The FIDE World Chess Championship is presented by Google, with online coverage and commentary provided by FIDE and Chess.com."

    "summary": "During negotiations at COP29 in Azerbaijan, geopolitical turmoil and worries of a looming U.S. withdrawal from global climate cooperation loomed large.",
    "story": [
      "When COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev stepped to the podium at the closing meeting of the Baku climate summit on Sunday morning, hoping to clinch a hard-fought agreement on global climate finance, he carried with him two speeches.",
      "One was crafted around a hoped-for deal being struck, while the other for the possibility of a summit-collapsing impasse, according to two sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.",
      "One of the sources \u2014 a person in the COP29 presidency \u2014 told Reuters that they worked through challenging negotiations until the last minute to ensure what it called the Baku Breakthrough, but still prepared different versions of the final speech for different possible outcomes.",
      "In the end, Babayev managed to gavel through the $300 billion finance plan to help developing nations cope with the soaring costs of global warming over the next decade before critics had time to object, allowing him to read the more positive speech.",
      "He praised the agreement as a breakthrough and shamed the deal\u2019s doubters as \u201cwrong,\u201d even as many of the climate deal\u2019s intended recipients\u00a0slammed it as woefully inadequate.",
      "Babayev\u2019s preparation for different outcomes at the divisive summit in the Caspian Sea nation of Azerbaijan reflected what many in the audience had already known before it began: the Baku climate talks were never going to go smoothly.",
      "Expectations for a deal were depressed by worries of a looming U.S. withdrawal from global climate cooperation, geopolitical turmoil, and a rise of isolationist politics that had shunted climate change off much of the world\u2019s top priorities list.",
      "Those obstacles\u00a0loomed large in Baku\u00a0and will continue to overshadow global climate efforts in the months ahead as Brazil prepares for next year\u2019s much broader conference in the Amazon rainforest city of Belem \u2014 where the world will plot a years-long course for steeper emission cuts and building resilience in the fight against climate change.",
      "\u201cMultilateralism as a whole is under threat,\u201d said Eliot Whittington, chief systems change officer at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership.",
      "\u201cIndeed, the UNFCCC is probably the bright spot \u2014 proving that even in the face of incredibly hostile geopolitics and on fundamentally difficult questions, a deal can be made,\u201d he said, referring to the U.N. body sponsoring the annual climate summit.",
      "But the slow pace of progress, with global emissions still rising, has raised tensions and\u00a0calls for reform.",
      "\u201cThis is something that needs to be looked at, when just a handful of countries, based on their own economic interests, can almost wreck the entire process,\u201d Sierra Leone Environment Minister Jiwoh Abdulai told Reuters.",
      "Trump effect",
      "Among the biggest factors clouding the negotiations in Baku was the looming return of climate skeptic Donald Trump as president of the United States, the world\u2019s biggest economy, largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, and top producer of oil and gas.",
      "Trump, who takes office in January, has pledged to withdraw the United States from the global Paris Agreement on climate change, as he did during his first 2017-2021 term in the White House, and has called climate change a hoax.",
      "Negotiators at the Baku conference said that while the U.S. delegation had helped in coming up with the climate finance deal, the country was unable to take a high-profile leadership role like it has in past climate summits, and it could not provide assurances the next administration would honor its pledges.",
      "\u201cWith the United States, well, the voters have voted and that\u2019s the way it is. What they\u2019re going to do, we do not know,\u201d South African Environment Minister Dion George said.",
      "U.S. officials at the COP29 conference\u00a0sought to reassure global partners\u00a0that market forces, existing federal subsidies, and state mandates would ensure continued renewable energy deployment even if Trump disengages from the global process.",
      "The war in Ukraine and rising conflict in the Middle East, meanwhile, have diverted global attention to security and energy availability, and led many governments to tighten their purse strings, experts said.",
      "That made getting a bigger climate finance number hard, observers to the talks said.",
      "\u201cEven maintaining climate finance at current levels in the current political environment is a huge fight,\u201d said Joe Thwaites, senior advocate on international climate finance at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.",
      "The agreement to provide $300 billion annually by 2035 would theoretically triple rich countries\u2019 previous commitments to provide $100 billion by 2020. That earlier goal was reached in full only in 2022, and expires in 2025.",
      "The unwillingness of wealthy countries to offer more money and the pressure to conclude even a weak deal ahead of more political turbulence became a major source of frustration for the least developed countries and small island states, who told the Baku conference they felt sidelined in the negotiations.",
      "At one point in the summit\u2019s final stretch, negotiating blocs representing both groups walked out of talks in protest, delaying a deal by hours.",
      "\u201cWe came in good faith, with the safety of our communities and the well-being of the world at heart,\u201d Tina Stege, the climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, said at the closing plenary.",
      "\u201cYet, we have seen the very worst of political opportunism here at this COP, playing games with the lives of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\u201d",
      "India\u2019s envoy, Chandni Raina, used her time to roundly reject the climate finance deal gaveled through by Babayev.",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed in the outcome which clearly brings out the unwillingness of the developed country parties to fulfil their responsibilities,\u201d she told the summit.",
      "Climate advocates said that, while the deal is better than an outright impasse, the rifts exposed by the conference as well as the loss of trust in the process among poorer countries will pose a problem for Brazil as it prepares for COP30.",
      "\u201cI think this is a toxic chalice for Belem, and it\u2019s going to be up to Brazil how they\u2019re going to restore the trust,\u201d said Oscar Sorria, director of the Common Initiative, a think tank focused on global financial reform."

    "summary": "Supporters of jailed former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan marched on the Pakistani capital Islamabad as police locked down the city.",
    "story": [
      "PESHAWAR, Pakistan \u2014 The capital of Pakistan was locked down Monday as supporters of jailed former leader Imran Khan marched on the city to demand his release. It is the latest upheaval to hit this nuclear-armed United States ally after days of deadly clashes between rival sectarian groups.",
      "That violence between warring Sunni and Shia Muslim factions was halted with an uneasy truce Sunday, though reports of skirmishes continued to emerge from the country\u2019s often-unruly, mountainous northwest.",
      "Just as that crisis cooled, however, authorities in the capital Islamabad were scrambling to block highways with shipping containers and restricting internet coverage, as police began to clash with those backing Khan, a former cricket icon turned ex-prime minister. Protesters and police traded accusations of brutality, with the police saying one of their number had been killed and more than 70 injured.",
      "Khan remains a popular figure in this Muslim-majority country of more than 230 million people. That\u2019s despite his imprisonment a year ago on some 150 charges including corruption, leaking state secrets and violating Islamic law. Supporters say these are trumped-up allegations, part of a wider effort to keep him and his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) off the ballot in elections earlier this year \u2014 and out of power.",
      "These backers organized what they called a \u201cfinal call\u201d or a \u201clong march\u201d on Islamabad on Monday, with officials saying the convoy of vehicles numbered 9,000-10,000 supporters. Video posted by the PTI showed marchers, led by Khan\u2019s wife, Bushra Bibi, dancing, drumming and waving flags as they closed in on the capital. Fleets of cars, trucks and motorbikes spanned the road, many of them flying the red and green PTI flag.",
      "\u201cWe will not return till our leader Imran Khan is released from prison,\u201d senior PTI politician Shaukat Ali Yousafzai told NBC News, adding that police had been using tear gas, causing injuries to some PTI supporters.",
      "Responding to these allegations, the chief minister of the Punjab region, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, said police deployed to stop the protesters were unarmed, and in turn accused the marchers of wielding\u00a0 shotguns, knives and teargas shells.",
      "Punjab information minister Uzma Bukhari said one officer had been killed more than 70 injured in the clashes, some of them seriously, as police released two pictures of officers it said had been hospitalized in the violence.",
      "The military-backed government said the protest was merely designed to disrupt a visit by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.",
      "\u201cWhenever there is a high level and close ally visit to Pakistan, why does PTI become adamant in doing protests and agitations?\u201d the country\u2019s commerce minister, Jamal Khan, posted to X, a platform which is banned in the country. \u201cThese visits benefit us in a overall economic enhancement and contribute to our overall foreign policy stance.",
      "The government\u00a0 responded by locking down the capital, placing shipping containers across major highways and leading to social media users calling the city \u201cContaineristan.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press said ambulances and other emergency vehicles were seen turning around after being obstructed by these makeshift roadblocks. Yousafzai, the senior PTI leader, said party workers had successfully removed some of these containers from the highway between the capital and Peshawar.",
      "Meanwhile officials e closed all schools and shut down cellphone internet access and Wi-Fi services in parts of the country considered a \u201csecurity concern.\u201d",
      "The PTI responded to these restrictions by sharing a link to BBC coverage of the story.",
      "\u201cWhile our local compromised media has completely blacked out the largest mobilization in the history of Pakistan, international media is reporting live on all the developments of this historic march,\u201d it posted.",
      "A truce in Kurram",
      "The chaos comes one day after the government mediated a cease-fire between rival Shiite and Sunni Muslim militant groups after days of clashes near the Afghan border that killed at least 65 people.",
      "The cease-fire in the sectarian-riven Kurram tribal district is set to last seven days, Mohammad Ali Saif, a local government spokesman and member of the delegation that negotiated the deal, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cIt is a breakthrough as the situation was quite explosive after clashes and human casualties from both sides,\u201d Saif said, adding that the factions agreed to exchange prisoners and the bodies of those killed.",
      "The groups have been engaged in a decadeslong land dispute in the region. These tensions flared last week after unidentified gunmen opened fire on a convoy of civilian vehicles passing through the region.",
      "All of the 45 killed in that incident, including eight women and five children, were from the Shiite community. This sparked outrage, with hundreds of men from the Shiite community storming local villages, killing and kidnapping a number of people, and setting fire to gas stations and shops, according to the local government and police.",
      "The violence prompted the government to dispatch the delegation to the region, which is 150 miles from Islamabad and closer to the Afghan capital Kabul.",
      "\u201cBoth sides had serious reservations about the insecurity and deteriorating law and order situation, lack of enough police force etc,\u201d Saif said. \u201cWe carefully listened to them and assured them of full cooperation in resolving all genuine issues to restore peace and harmony in the tribal district.\u201d",
      "Small groups were still attacking each other\u2019s villages in the rural areas, Saif added, but he said that he hoped that they too would soon stop fighting.",
      "Mushtaq Yusufzai reported from Peshawar, Pakistan, and Alexander Smith from London."

      "Currently, between 30% to 50% of all gang members in the violence-wracked country are children, according to the U.N.",
      "\u201cThis is a very concerning trend,\u201d said Geeta Narayan, UNICEF\u2019s representative in Haiti.",
      "The increase comes as poverty deepens and violence increases amid political instability, with gangs that control 85% of Port-au-Prince attacking once peaceful communities in a push to assume total control of the capital.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re not doing this voluntarily,\u201d Narayan said. \u201cEven when they are armed with weapons, the child here is the victim.\u201d",
      "Easy prey",
      "In a country where more than 60% of the population lives on less than $4 a day and hundreds of thousands of Haitians are starving or nearing starvation, recruiting children is often easy.",
      "One minor who was in a gang said he was paid $33 every Saturday, while another said he was paid thousands of dollars in his first month in a gang operation, according to a U.N. Security Council report.",
      "\u201cChildren and families are becoming increasingly desperate in some cases because of the extreme poverty,\u201d Narayan said.",
      "If children refuse to join a gang, gunmen often threaten them or their families or simply abduct them.",
      "Gangs also prey on children who are separated from their families after they are deported from the Dominican Republic, which shares a border with Haiti on the island of Hispaniola.",
      "\u201cThose children are increasingly the ones targeted,\u201d Narayan said.",

Police said that at least 28 suspected gang members were killed that day as residents armed with guns and machetes fought side-by-side with officers.",
      "Increased vulnerability",
      "The gangs that recruit the most children are 5 Segond, Brooklyn, Kraze Barye, Grand Ravine and Terre Noire, according to the U.N. Security Council report.",
      "Usually, new recruits are ordered to buy food and are given money to \u201cbuy friends\u201d as gangs observe them. Then, they participate in confrontations and are promoted if they kill someone, for example. After two or three years in the gang, the recruit becomes part of the entourage if they prove they weren\u2019t a spy, according to the report.",
      "Recruitment is surging as many schools remain closed and children become increasingly vulnerable, with gang violence leaving more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years, including an estimated 365,000 minors. Many of them live in makeshift shelters where they\u2019re preyed upon by gangs and face physical and sexual violence.",
      "\u201cCriminal groups in Haiti are subjecting girls and women to horrific sexual abuse,\u201d stated a report published Monday by Human Rights Watch.",
      "The report quoted a 14-year-old girl from the capital who said she was abducted and raped multiple times by different men for five days in a house with six other girls who also were raped and beaten.",
      "Human Rights Watch noted that while fighting between armed groups has decreased this year, attacks on Haitians, police and critical infrastructure has increased.",

      "\u2018It\u2019s not all rosy\u2019",
      "Gangs are targeting children as young as eight years old, and the longer they spend with an armed group, the harder it is to rescue them and reintegrate them into society, according to experts.",
      "Violence is rewarded and encouraged, which Narayan said is extremely harmful to a child\u2019s psychosocial development.",
      "Children quit gangs in several ways: some leave willingly, others escape and sometimes nonprofits will find them and take them to centers where they receive medical care if needed as well as psychological help and other aid.",
      "\u201cThere is a transition period,\u201d Narayan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not all rosy. It does take time on all sides.\u201d"
