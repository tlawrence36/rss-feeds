      "The leading hip-hop superstar beef has been cranked up another notch, with Drake suing Universal Music Group for defamation over rival Kendrick Lamar\u2019s diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "A hip-hop superstar beef was cranked up another notch Wednesday when Drake sued Universal Music Group for defamation over rival Kendrick Lamar's diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges UMG published and promoted the track even though it included false pedophilia allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice. Lamar is not named in the suit.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard at Drake\u2019s Toronto home, as well as online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and decreasing his brand's value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year. The company has contracts with both stars.",
      "\u201cThe lawsuit is not about the artist who created \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019\" the lawsuit says, referring to Lamar. \u201cIt is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\u201d",
      "The suit later alleges, \u201cUMG did so because it understood that the Recording's inflammatory and shocking allegations were a gold mine.\u201d",
      "And, the suit claims, the music company has made large investments and used its connections to arrange for \u201cNot Like Us\u201d to be performed at next month's Super Bowl, where Lamar will be the halftime entertainment.",
      "The lawsuit, which is seeking a trial and an undisclosed amount of money for damages, also repeated allegations in other legal filings that UMG falsely pumped up the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on streaming services.",
      "Representatives for Drake declined to comment Wednesday. Representatives for UMG and Lamar did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "In a previous statement responding to similar allegations in pre-litigation filings, the record company said the \u201csuggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns.\u201d",
      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre\u2019s biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year.",
      "Drake's lawyers, from New York-based Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said the lawsuit seeks to hold UMG accountable for knowingly promoting false and defamatory allegations against him."

      "Another classic cinematic monster has been dusted off in \u201cWolf Man,\u201d an R-rated Blumhouse movie which hits theaters on Friday",
      "Blake Lovell thinks taking his wife and young daughter to rural Oregon to pack up his dead father's belongings is a good idea. It's a break from their urban life, might help repair his fraying marriage and reconnect them all with nature. \u201cIt would be good for us,\u201d he argues.",
      "It will not, of course, because this is a Blumhouse movie called \u201cWolf Man.\u201d It will not be good for Blake and it will not be good for the audience. That's because this film is a terrible misfire using a classic movie monster poorly rebooted by the modern home of horror.",
      "Slack when it should be terrifying, \u201cWolf Man\u201d suffers from cheap sentimentality, laughably obvious script reveals, poor continuity and a creature that is less predatory than painful. Pity comes to mind.",
      "Christopher Abbott stars as Blake, a father and husband whose own estranged dad was a tad unstable, constantly drilling in his son a survivalist ethic. \u201cIt's not hard to die. It's the easiest thing in the world,\u201d his dad says. He being officially declared dead 30 years after he disappeared into the forest starts this sludgy movie off.",
      "\"The Invisible Man\" writer-director Leigh Whannell \u2014 who co-wrote the story with Corbett Tuck \u2014 seems to be attempting a horror movie with his new message: Being overprotective can lead to your family being assaulted by a deranged manbeast. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe it's about inheritance? It's all a little muddled.",
      "A weird human-animal hybrid lurking in the Oregon wilderness \u2014 actually New Zealand pretending to be Oregon \u2014 kicks off what is supposed to be the scary part of this movie, but so much time is spent on the domestic drama set-up that the audience will be bored by the time the supposed thrill ride shows up. When it does, the filmmakers lean on creepy sounds way too much.",
      "There's a Wolf Man out there and he's, well, underwhelming. He is largely unseen for most of the movie because seeing the monster is always a bad idea. At one, point, he attacks through the cabin's doggie door, one of the most disappointing assaults on film.",
      "Now infected inside their barricaded cabin, Blake goes through a body-horror transformation, which includes the sweats, enhanced hearing, uncontrolled peeing, teeth readjustment, mottled skin, being made mute and hair loss. That's right, hair loss. This is the first Wolf Man movie that seems to endorse Rogaine.",
      "His wife, played by Julia Garner, is left here to sniffle and shriek, going from life partner to potential dinner. That means a lot of running and panting with a flashlight in hand. Their daughter, played by Matilda Firth, earlier so precocious, now asks really stupid questions like \u201cWhat's happening?\u201d and \u201cWhat's wrong with Daddy?\u201d",
      "So, outside the cabin lurks a Wolf Man. And inside is potentially another, but one still kind of trying to hold onto his humanity. \u201cMom, he wants this to be over,\u201d the girl says of her dad-wolf. We know the feeling.",
      "\u201cWolf Man,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cbloody violent content, grisly images and some language.\u201d Running time: 103 minutes. No stars out of four."

      "But the enormity of the destruction in Southern California has quickly snuffed out all festiveness in the movie industry\u2019s high season of celebration. At one point, the flames even encroached on the hillside above the Dolby Theatre, the home of the Academy Awards.",

Not for the first time this decade, the Oscars are facing the question of: Should the show go on? And if it does, what do they mean now?",
      "\u201cWith ALL due respect during Hollywood\u2019s season of celebration, I hope any of the networks televising the upcoming awards will seriously consider NOT televising them and donating the revenue they would have gathered to victims of the fires and the firefighters,\u201d \u201cHacks\u201d star Jean Smart, a recent Globe winner, wrote on Instagram.",

With so many left without a home by the fires, there\u2019s scant appetite for the usual self-congratulatory parades of the season.",

The ongoing nature of the crisis, which has killed at least 25 people, has made remaking well-laid plans a moving target. The Critics Choice Awards have been postponed. Nominations to the Producers Guild Awards have been delayed twice with no new date set. On Tuesday, the guild established a fund to support producers affected by the fires.",
      "The 67th Grammy Awards, scheduled to be held Feb. 2 in downtown Los Angeles, are going forward, albeit with significant changes. Harvey Mason jr., Recording Academy chief executive and Board of Trustees chair Tammy Hurt said this year's Grammys \u201cwill carry a renewed sense of purpose: raising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.\u201d",
      "Some telethon-like element also seems sure to accompany the Oscars. In recent days, many throughout the industry have voiced suggestions for how the broadcast could be reconsidered. A not dissimilar process happened during the 2021 Oscars, which were postponed to late April because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Oscars have been moved a few times throughout history, including in 1938, when the show was delayed a week due to historic flooding in Los Angeles.",
      "For the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, the wildfires have been acutely personal. Four of the academy\u2019s 55-person board of governors lost their homes, according to The Hollywood Reporter, including producer Lynette Howell Taylor, visual effects governor Brooke Breton, sound branch governor Mark P. Stoeckinger and animation branch governor Jinko Gotoh. The Pacific Palisades, which was largely destroyed by the fires, was home to many stars and executives.",
      "For potential nominees, this would normally be when they\u2019d be at their most active, campaigning in Q&As and other events tied to the all-important nominations voting period. All of that has ground to a halt. Isabella Rossellini, who\u2019s favored to be nominated for best supporting actress for her performance in \u201cConclave,\u201d on Instagram posted a photograph of an Oscar lying in ashes. The photo turned out to be fake, but it accurately captured Hollywood\u2019s current mood.",
      "Several high-profile TV series were forced to pause production because of the fires but notably few movie shoots were affected. That, in itself, is a reflection of a Hollywood that has seen the majority of film production seek tax incentives in other states.",
      "Work throughout the film and TV industry hasn\u2019t rebounded following the 2023 strikes, leaving large numbers of crew members unemployed. So quiet are studio lots that actress Natalie Morales (\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d) has advocated for studios, in the wake of the fires, to turn empty soundstages into temporary classrooms, erected by out-of-work craftspeople, for children whose schools burned down.",
      "It\u2019s a reminder that many in the film business need all the work they can find, including all the jobs that accompany the Oscars. Not only are the Academy Awards a vital spotlight on a wide swath of movies that otherwise might struggle to find audiences, the awards provide a lot of jobs to an awards season industrial complex of workers, stylists and vendors.",
      "With so many out of work before the fires hit, Silvina Knight, an Emmy-winning makeup artist, calls this latest crisis \u201canother setback \u2013 a big one.\u201d She is currently working on \u201cSuits LA,\u201d one of the series that stopped filming due to the fires.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how people are going to feel about getting dressed up and when they just lost everything,\u201d said Knight of the Oscars. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know, it might be a show of force when we come back. Yeah, this is tragic, but we are all coming together. Even driving home the other night, motorists were being very considerate of each other, which is unusual for Los Angeles.\u201d",

      "When Lucy Walker debuted her harrowing documentary about California wildfires, \u201cBring Your Own Brigade,\u201d at Sundance in 2021, it was during peak COVID",
      "NEW YORK -- When Lucy Walker debuted her harrowing documentary about California wildfires, \u201cBring Your Own Brigade,\u201d at Sundance in 2021, it was during peak COVID. Not the best time for a film on a wholly different scourge.",
      "\u201cIt was really hard,\u201d the Oscar-nominated filmmaker says now. \u201cI didn\u2019t blame people for not wanting to watch a film about the fires in the middle of the pandemic, because it was just too much horror.\"",
      "And so the film, though acclaimed \u2014 it was named one of the 10 best films of the year by the New York Times \u2013 didn\u2019t reach an audience as large as Walker had hoped, with its urgent display of the human cost of wildfires and its tough, crucial questions for the future.",
      "That could change. Walker thinks people may now be more receptive to her message, given the devastating wildfires that have wrought havoc on Los Angeles itself the past week. Firefighters were preparing on Tuesday to attack new blazes amid warnings that winds combined with severely dry conditions created a \u201c particularly dangerous situation.\"",
      "\u201cThis is probably the moment where it becomes undeniable,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "She added: \"It does feel like people are now asking the question that I was asking a few years ago, like, 'Is it safe to live in Los Angeles? And why is this happening, and what can we do about it? And the good news is that there are some things we can do about it. What\u2019s tricky is that they\u2019re really hard to accomplish.\u201d",
      "In \u201cBring Your Own Brigade\" (available on Paramount+), Walker portrays in sometimes terrifying detail the devastation caused by two wildfires on the same day in 2018, products of the same wind event \u2014 the Camp Fire that engulfed the northern California city of Paradise and the Woolsey fire in Malibu, two towns on opposite ends of the political and economic spectrum.",
      "She embeds herself with firefighters, and explores the lives of locals affected by the fire. She shares harrowing cellphone footage of people driving through exploding columns of fire as they try to escape, crying out \u201cI don\u2019t want to die!\u201d She plays 911 calls in which people plead vainly for rescue as fire laps at their backyards or invades their homes.",
      "And she conveys a layered message: Devastating fires in California are increasingly inevitable. Climate change is a clear accelerating factor, yes, but it\u2019s not the only one, and therein lies an element of hope: There are things people can do, if they start to make different (and difficult) choices \u2014 in both where and how they choose to live.",
      "But first, complacency must be vanquished.",
      "\u201cComplacency sets in when there hasn\u2019t been a fire for a few years and you start to think, it might not happen again,\u201d Walker says.",
      "It even affected Walker herself a few months ago. A British transplant to Los Angeles, she had chosen to live on the Venice-Santa Monica border \u2014 too scared, she says, to live in the city's lovely hilly areas with small winding roads, surrounded by nature and vegetation, near the canyons that wildfires love.",
      "But a few months ago, she started wondering if over-anxiety about wildfires had incorrectly influenced her choice. And then, of course, came the Palisades catastrophe \u2014\u201cthis God awful reminder that it only takes one event,\u201d she says.",
      "Walker became interested in making a film about wildfires after she arrived in the city and wondered if she was safe. \u201cWhy is the hillside on fire?\u201d she says she wondered. \u201cWhy do people just keep on driving?\u201d She had considered such fires \u201ca medieval problem.\"",
      "One thing she learned while filming: Firefighters were even more impressive and courageous than she'd thought. \u201cIf you want to watch a firefighter have their heart broken, it\u2019s when they want to do more,\u201d she says. \"I was just absolutely wowed by how incredibly selfless and brilliant they were.\u201d",
      "Not that the public wasn\u2019t angry at them \u2014 her film depicts angry residents of Malibu, for example, chastising firefighters for not doing enough.",
      "One of the most stunning parts of \u201cBring Your Own Brigade\u201d \u2014 the title is a reference to the economic inequity of wealthy homeowners or celebrities like Kim Kardashian hiring private firefighters \u2014 is watching the reaction of firefighters at a town meeting in Paradise, where 85 people had been killed in the fire. They've convened to discuss adopting safety measures as they rebuild. One by one, measures are rejected \u2014 even the simplest, requiring a five-foot buffer around every house where nothing is flammable. Safety takes a back burner to individual choice.",
      "\u201cIt was very shocking to be at that meeting in particular, given that people had died in the most horrible way in that community. And you have firefighters with tears in their eyes saying, 'This is what we need to have happen to keep us safe, and then (they) get voted down.\"",
      "Walker is not the only filmmaker to have made a film about Paradise. In 2020, Ron Howard directed \u201cRebuilding Paradise,\u201d focused on the effort to rebuild, and the resilience of residents. Walker says she looked at the same set of facts and arrived at different takeaways.",
      "Townspeople were indeed amazing and resilient, Walker says. \u201cBut are we right to be building back without a real rethink? Because the tragedy is that these fires are predictably going to be repeating and against the backdrop of climate change, they're getting worse, not better.\u201d",
      "That rethink involves making hard calls about where people should live. \u201cThe population is overwhelmingly moving into these wildland urban interface areas,\u201d Walker says, referring to areas where housing meets undeveloped wildland vegetation \u2014 exactly the areas most likely to burn.",
      "In California, some of these places are very expensive \u2014 like Palisades and Malibu \u2014 but others are in more affordable areas. With the great pressure on housing, more people are moving into such areas, she says. But the \u201cbraking mechanism\u201d could be that insurance companies \u201care doing the math, and it\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d",
      "It's not only a question of where people live.",
      "\u201cWhat does a fire-hardened home look like?\u201d Walker asks. \u201cDesign-wise, that that does dictate certain things.\u201d For example: \u201cThis lovely wood is going to require tremendous firefighting.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s too early to know, but Walker thinks she may be hearing something different now from those who've lost homes, of whom she knows many.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from people is not just \u2018I can\u2019t wait to rebuild. Let me rebuild,'\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s: 'How could we go through that again?'\u201d"

      "Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton\u2019s provocative ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand under controversy, has died at age 82",
      "MILAN -- Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton\u2019s provocative ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand amid controversy, died Monday at age 82.",
      "Toscani disclosed last year he had a rare disease. \"It is with immense pain that we announce that our beloved Oliviero has undertaken his next journey,\" his wife, Kirsti, and their three children said in a statement. He died at a hospital in Livorno, Tuscany, the news agency ANSA reported.",
      "Toscani had amyloidosis, a disease characterized by a buildup of abnormal protein deposits in the body. He told Corriere della Sera in August he had lost 40 kilograms (nearly 90 pounds) in a year, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have left to live, but I\u2019m not interested in living like this anyway.\u201d",
      "Toscani also said he would like to be remembered \u201cnot for any one photo but for my whole work, for the commitment.\u201d",
      "Toscani was the creative force behind shock ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s that featured images such as the pope kissing an imam on the lips, which angered the Vatican.",
      "Other images promoting the United Colors of Benetton depicted a priest embracing a nun, a newborn baby with its umbilical cord and a black woman breastfeeding a white baby, part of the brand\u2019s advocacy for diversity, religious tolerance and environmental messages.",
      "During a 1997 shoot of a Benetton campaign featuring Jews and Arabs living peacefully together in Israel, Toscani told The Associated Press, \u201cAny picture is a political image, so we make our choice and we go for the real thing.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cYou might have to face criticism. A lot of people don\u2019t like things that are different. Everybody likes to conform. We don\u2019t conform.\u201d",
      "His decadeslong relationship with Benetton was severed in 2020 after Toscani outraged relatives of victims of the deadly 2018 Genoa bridge collapse, telling RAI television, \u201cWho cares about a bridge collapse?\u201d He was responding to an outcry over a photograph of founding members of a political protest movement alongside key members of the Benetton family, which controlled the company that maintained the bridge.",
      "Toscani apologized in an interview with La Repubblica, saying: \u201cI am sorry. More: I am ashamed to apologize. I am humanly destroyed and deeply pained.\u201d But the damage was done, and Benetton ended a relationship that had flourished from 1982-2000 and been rekindled in 2018.",
      "Benetton remembered Toscani in a social media post: \u201cFarewell, Oliviero. Keep on dreaming,\u2019\u2019 beneath Toscani's 1989 photo of a hand offering a bouquet of flowers.",
      "Toscani was born in Milan on Feb. 28, 1942, the son of a photojournalist for Corriere della Sera. He studied photography and graphics at the University of the Arts in Zurich from 1961-65, and worked with the newly founded Vogue Italia and other major fashion publications.",
      "Over the years, he shot campaigns for such brands as Chanel, Robe di Kappa, Fiorucci and Esprit. But he was probably best known for his work for the United Colors of Benetton, with images that carried messages promoting equality and diversity while denouncing anorexia, homophobia, the death penalty and racism.",
      "His work for United Colors of Benetton, a brand then known most for its colorful knitwear, raised its global profile. In the early 1990s, he conceived and directed \u201cColors,\u201d a global publication distributed in Benetton stores, and created along with Luciano Benetton the research center Fabrica in Benetton\u2019s home city of Treviso that supported and launched many fashion industry careers.",
      "Toscani tackled the AIDS crisis in the early 1990s with a colored condom campaign, during which Benetton sold a range of colored condoms, and used a colorized version of a portrait of AIDS activist David Kirby surrounded by family as he was dying.",
      "In 2007, Toscani\u2019s \u201cNo Anorexia\u201d campaign for the Italian fashion brand Nolita sparked fresh discussions about the illness and its relationship to the fashion industry. Toscani\u2019s photograph with skeletally thin model Isabelle Caro was revealed on giant billboards and in newspaper ads during Milan Fashion Week and received worldwide attention.",
      "He was also involved in projects addressing problems such as road safety, violence against women and stray dogs.",

Reviews, however, have been very good for \u201cBetter Man.\u201d",

      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \u201ccall and response\u201d of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music\u2019s most enduring hits, which also included \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Like I Know,\u201d \u201cWhen Something is Wrong With My Baby\u201d and \u201cI Thank You.\u201d",

      "Like many \u201960s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \u201cSoul Man\u201d hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \u201cSoul Men\u201d depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",

      "Moore wrote the song \u201cDole Man,\u201d modeled on \u201cSoul Man,\u201d for Republican Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s campaign used the song \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin\u2019.\u201d",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s, but didn\u2019t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label\u2019s Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band\u2019s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",

I\u2019m laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\u201d",

I'm doing whatever I can to help alleviate it.\u201d",
      "For those looking to help, Guttenberg suggested starting with a simple call or text to ask displaced neighbors what they might need like food, supplies or emotional support. He also encouraged those who can return to their homes, if safe, to check on their property and assist others in assessing the damage.",
      "Guttenberg, the star of films like \u201cShort Circuit,\u201d \u201cPolice Academy and \u201dThree Men and a Baby,\" is unsure how the film and TV industry will able to help during the beginning of awards season.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s gonna do what regular people do: Help each other, give each other food and water, help each other in their backyards, in their front yards,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though somebody\u2019s an actor, producer, writer, director, we\u2019re all just people. ..

      "Schenk led 16 productions at New York's Metropolitan Opera, starting with Puccini's \u201cTosca\u201d in 1968 and ending with Donizetti's \u201cDon Pasquale\u201d in 1996. His staging of Wagner's four-work \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen\u201d premiered from 1986-89 and was shown in 20 full cycles from 1989 to 2009 and broadcast on public television in 1990. Schenk received a huge ovation when he took a curtain call after an April 18, 2009, performance of \u201cSiegfried.\u201d",
      "His romantic, realistic staging had set designer G\u00fcnther Schneider-Siemssen create images of a river, forest and mountains dominated by greens and oranges, and costumes by Rolf Langenfass that evoked the original Ring of the 1876 Bayreuth Festival. It was in a way a response to Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's centennial Ring at Bayreuth in 1976, set in an industrial age Ring and interpreted by some as Marxist.",
      "\u201cI wanted to tell a romantic old story, like starting with \u2018Once upon a time,\u2019\u201d Schenk said during a 1989 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAll the secrets of Wagner\u2019s Ring should be guessed by the audience or found by the audience.\u201d",
      "Born in Vienna, Schenk studied acting at Vienna's University of Music and Performing Arts, began directing in 1953 and led his first opera, Mozart's \u201cDie Zauberfl\u00f6te (The Magic Flute),\" at Salzburg's State Theatre in 1957. He continued to act and performed 237 times at the Salzburg Festival from 1950-97, becoming head of drama there from 1986-88.",
      "\u201cThe theater world has lost one of its greatest phenomena, an exceptional artist, a real legend,\u201d current Salzburg Festival artistic director Markus Hinterh\u00e4user said in a statement.",
      "At the Met, his stagings of Offenbach's \u201cLes Contes d\u2019Hoffmann (The Tales of Hoffmann)\u201d and Wagner's \u201cTannh\u00e4user\u201d in 1977 earned rave reviews, and Met artistic director James Levine picked him to direct a new Ring Cycle plus Wagner's \u201cParsifal\u201d in 1991 and \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\" in 1993.",
      "\u201cAt a time when many new productions of `Der Ring des Nibelungen' might be more aptly entitled `Der Ringling des Barnum und Bailey,' the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s staging of Wagner\u2019s epic has cast a vote for the notion that maybe, just maybe, the composer knew best,\" New York Times critic Donal Henahan wrote in 1989. \u201cThe Metropolitan\u2019s trend-bucking project has aroused widespread suspicion, even resentment. `Traditional,' `conventional,' `regressive' and `childishly representational' were some of the nicer epithets thrown about in lobbies and in print. ... Even granting the possibility that radical rethinking of Wagner\u2019s works might occasionally stimulate thought about their everyday relevance, a staging that pays honor to the original is a useful counterbalance.\u201d",
      "Met presentations were long dominated by Schenk and Franco Zeffirelli, who had 11 stagings that premiered from 1964-98. Schenk said he did not look for hidden meanings.",
      "\u201cWagner in his life gave no indication on what the Ring meant,\" Schenk told the AP. \"He didn\u2019t interpret.\u201d"

      "The Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world two decades ago",
      "LONDON -- Two decades ago, the Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world. They waltzed in stripped-shirts and quickly became global icons for their deliriously hooky songs, hitting a critical mass in the chant-along singles \u201cTake Me Out\u201d and \u201cDo You Want To.\u201d A lot has changed in that time, but the band never wavered in their dedication to 2000s indie ebullience. Over the last few years there's been a bit of an indie music resurgence, but for Franz Ferdinand, it never went away.",
      "On Friday, they will release \"The Human Fear,'' their sixth studio album and the first in seven years, making the end of the longest break between full lengths in their career.",
      "Frontman Alex Kapranos says the album tackles relationships forming and breaking down. \u201cThe title is a clue to the scene,\u201d he teases. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t written to the theme, at least not consciously.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in London, Kapranos and Franz Ferdinand bassist Bob Hardy discussed about \u201cThe Human Fear,\u201d the resurgence of indie music and the band's love for Chappell Roan and Charli XCX. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "KAPRANOS: The last song that was written, the last lyrics that were written was (for) the song \u201cHooked.\u201d It starts off with the line, \u201cI\u2019ve got the fear / I\u2019ve got the human fear.\u201d And I realize that so many of the songs had an underlying theme of fear to them. But not necessarily succumbing to fear, but more like overcoming fear.",
      "\u201cThe Doctor\u201d is about the fear of leaving an institution, and \u201cBar Lonely\u201d is the fear of leaving a relationship. \u201cNight or Day\u201d is the fear of committing to a relationship. But fear is fascinating because fear is universal. We all experience fear. We all experience the same fears. But how we respond to it is individual. And that\u2019s how we find who we are, our personalities. And overcoming fear feels good. That\u2019s why we watch horror films or ride rollercoasters \u2014 because you overcome fear and then feel very alive for having done so.",
      "KAPRANOS: The song starts off addressing that feeling that we all have sometimes, which is, you know, you feel that your life is collapsing around about you for one reason or another. It could be a relationship that is disintegrating. Often, it'll go that things tend to happen to you (all) at once. The relationship starts going south as well as your professional life. And then you realize that the washing machine leaked and your basement\u2019s flooded and just all that kind of annoying stuff. Your phone gets nicked or whatever. And it can be overwhelming. And you just, you have this sense of fear that, \"Gosh, everything\u2019s collapsing.\"",
      "I guess I was feeling a little bit like that when I was writing the song for one reason or another. And I thought, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d ... I\u2019m just going to do something astonishingly audacious. I\u2019m going to go into it with an audacious attitude and get through it that sort of way. And don't blame anybody else for it as well. Like, own the responsibility of overcoming the fear myself.",
      "KAPRANOS: We\u2019re not one of these kinds of bands that will sit down and say, \u201cRight, we\u2019ve got two months to write an album. \u201d For me, you\u2019re always writing, you\u2019re always coming up with ideas. And so, on this album, there\u2019s ideas that were written in the studio literally the day before it was sent off to be mastered. And there\u2019s also ideas \u2026 I think the oldest idea is the bassline (of) one of the songs, which is from 1995.",
      "I think the way my brain works is like if you imagine going into the office of a university\u2019s eccentric professor that\u2019s scattered with bits of paper. It's all kind of like catastrophic, organizational hell, but they know exactly where everything is. That\u2019s what my brain is like with bits of ideas and bits of songs and stuff like that. I know where they are, and when I need to use them, they\u2019ll come out.",
      "HARDY: And the show has become the reward for making records, to me. It all kind of focuses playing it live in front of an audience and seeing people react to it in the moment. When you release a record, you don\u2019t see people listen to it at home. You know, the way you kind of get the reaction is these live shows.",
      "HARDY: It's never gone away.",
      "KAPRANOS: There was a period in the late-2000s where there was point of saturation where, like, you turned on any mainstream radio show and you heard nothing but indie bands. And when it becomes that saturated, maybe the quality control goes down slightly. And then when that happens, there\u2019s always a reaction to it. And I think over the last decade, there\u2019s been a bit of, \u201cRight, okay, so we\u2019re going to listen to like pure pop instead.\u201d And of course, there\u2019s some brilliant stuff like Charli XCX. Amazing. Chappell Roan (is) incredible. But there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s maybe not quite premier tier as well. And I think there's been maybe a little bit of a reaction to that.",
      "I think from our perspective, just, yeah, make the thing that you love and then you\u2019re not really going to go wrong."

      "The upcoming season will focus on lessons in emotional well-being. It debuts Jan. 16 on MAX with new episodes releasing every Thursday. \u201cSesame Street\u201d will also be available on PBS stations and to stream on PBS Kids in the fall.",
      "No one is more excited than Elmo himself.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot to learn from music \u2014 yeah, timing and harmonies and melody and different styles and different cultures,\u201d the 3 1/2-year-old monster told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's really cool! We've got a lot of wonderful people come and do some music with us on \u2018Sesame Street,' like Miss Rene\u00e9 Rapp and SZA! Chris Stapleton, Noah Kahan, Samara Joy \u2014 lots of great people!\u201d",
      "Songs double as life lessons on \u201cSesame Street,\u201d from an alt-R&B-pop track about gratitude with SZA to an acoustic number about feelings with Rapp.",
      "\"SZA is really cool \u2014 really talented. And \u2018gratitude\u2019 was a new word for Elmo, too. So, Elmo learned all about gratitude with SZA,\u201d he said.",
      "\"Elmo was feeling really, really happy after his playdate with Miss Rene\u00e9. It was a really beautiful song. She's got a great voice and Elmo hopes she comes back soon.\u201d",
      "As for the secret to a great \u201cSesame Street\u201d song? According to Tony - and Grammy-winning composer, producer and \u201cSesame Street\u201d music director Bill Sherman, its \u201cearworms on earworms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the verse is an earworm, so is the chorus. Mostly in pop music, the chorus is the earworm, and the verses are just a bunch of jumble.\u201d The difference, he explains, is that pop songs are about three and a half minutes long. Children's music is about a minute and a half. \u201cYou only have a very finite amount of time to do what you got to do.\u201d",
      "Usually, writers on the show provide Sherman and his team of songwriters with a script and lyrics detailing the lesson of each episode, as well as the name of the musical guest. Then they get to work, composing music true to the genre and spirit of each artist.",
      "Those musical guests take different levels of involvement, but the result is always awe-inspiring.",
      "Other highlights from this season include Kahan performing a foot-stomping folk song about music and feelings, Joy using jazz improvisation to teach a lesson in taking turns and a country ode to music and friends courtesy of Stapleton.",
      "\u201cChris Stapleton really wanted to write his own song,\u201d says Sherman, and so the pair hopped on a Zoom and wrote a song together, Stapleton with his guitar in tow, ideas flowing. \u201cIt was really one of the most surreal two-hour Zooms that I really ever had in my life.\u201d",
      "Joy took a different approach. \u201cSamara Joy insisted on singing live,\" says Sherman. \u201cIt very rarely happens on \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 I can only count, like, a few times. So, there was like Stevie Wonder back in the day, which is a classic. And there\u2019s like Billy Joel, there\u2019s John Legend, there\u2019s a couple people that actually sing live. But Samara insisted on it.\u201d",
      "Her reasoning was simple. \"She said, \u2018Well, this whole episode is about improvisation and thinking on your toes. And so, if it\u2019s prerecorded, that\u2019s the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to teach.\u2019\"",
      "If there is a theme that connects all these performances to one another, it's a spirit of connection. At least, that's Elmo's theory: \u201cElmo thinks that music brings people together, you know? And some people who like some things and some people who like other things can kind of come together because they like the same kind of music. And that's kind of cool!\u201d",
      "\u201cSesame Street,\u201d designed by education professionals and child psychologists, is shown in more than 150 countries, has won over 200 Emmys, 11 Grammys, two Peabody Awards and received a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime artistic achievement, the first time a television program got the award.",
      "There've been no shortage of great musical guests across the show's five decade run. So, who would they like to see pay a visit in the future? \u201cMiss Taylor Swift! Maybe she could revisit her \u2018Red\u2019 era?\u201d chimes in Elmo. That's his favorite of her albums.",
      "\u201cBut also, Elmo would love to sing with Miss Beyonc\u00e9. Destiny's Child was on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 so Elmo would love to have her back.\u201d"

      "Food manufacturers will have until January 2027 to remove the dye from their products, while makers of ingested drugs have until January 2028 to do the same. Other countries still allow for certain uses of the dye, but imported foods must meet the new U.S. requirement.",
      "Consumer advocates praised the decision.",
      "\u201cThis is a welcome, but long overdue, action from the FDA: removing the unsustainable double standard in which Red 3 was banned from lipstick but permitted in candy,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, director of the group Center for Science in the Public Interest, which led the petition effort.",
      "It's not clear whether the ban will face legal challenges from food manufacturers because evidence hasn\u2019t determined that the dye causes cancer when consumed by humans. At a hearing in December, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf suggested that's a risk.",
      "\u201cWhen we do ban something, it will go to court,\u201d he told members of Congress on Dec. 5. \u201cAnd if we don't have the scientific evidence, we will lose in court.\u201d",
      "When the FDA declined to allow Red 3 in cosmetics and topical drugs in 1990, the color additive was already permitted in foods and ingested drugs. Because research showed then that the way the dye causes cancer in rats does not apply to humans, \"the FDA did not take action to revoke the authorization of Red No. 3 in food,\u201d the agency has said on its website.",
      "Health advocates for years have asked the FDA to reconsider that decision, including the 2022 petition led by CSPI. In November, nearly two dozen members of Congress sent a letter demanding that FDA officials ban Red 3.",
      "Lawmakers cited the Delaney Clause and said the action was especially important to protect children, who consume more of the dye on a bodyweight basis than adults, the lawmakers said.",
      "\u201cThe FDA should act quickly to protect the nation's youth from this harmful dye, used simply to give food and drinks a bright red color,\u201d the letter said. \u201cNo aesthetic reason could justify the use of a carcinogen in our food supply.\u201d",
      "Red 3 is banned for food use in Europe, Australia and New Zealand except in certain kinds of cherries. The dye will be banned in California starting in January 2027.",
      "The International Association of Color Manufacturers defends the dye, saying that it is safe in levels typically consumed by humans. The group points to research by scientific committees operated by the United Nations and the World Health Organization, including a 2018 review that reaffirmed the safety of Red 3 in food.",
      "Some food manufacturers have already reformulated products to remove Red 3. In its place they use beet juice; carmine, a dye made from insects; and pigments from foods such as purple sweet potato, radish and red cabbage, according to Sensient Food Colors, a St. Louis-based supplier of food colors and flavorings.",

    "summary": "The Biden administration is floating a long-awaited proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine levels",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is floating a long-awaited proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine levels",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal officials on Wednesday released a far-reaching proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine content, a goal long sought by antismoking advocates that is unlikely to go into effect anytime soon.",
      "The proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration comes in the final days of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, greatly reducing the likelihood that it will actually be enacted. President-elect Donald Trump and his health nominees have not commented on the measure, but a similar effort led by Trump\u2019s first FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, was sidelined during his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s health secretary nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said little about how regulating tobacco fits into his plans to overhaul the government's approach to fighting chronic disease. Even if the effort goes ahead under Trump, tobacco companies like Reynolds American and Altria are almost certain to challenge it in court, delaying implementation.",
      "The FDA has spent years studying the issue and said Wednesday that reducing nicotine would help nearly 13 million current smokers quit cigarettes within one year. Roughly 48 million more young people would never take up the habit because cigarettes would essentially become nonaddictive, according to agency projections.",
      "Under the agency's plan, nicotine would be capped at levels that \u201ccould no longer create and sustain this addiction among people who smoke.\u201d The agency's 334-page analysis was posted online in the federal register Wednesday morning.",
      "Antismoking advocates overwhelmingly back the idea and urged Kennedy to help implement it, if he is confirmed.",
      "\u201cTobacco regulation is a huge part of reaching the goals he\u2019s outlined for reducing chronic disease and a really important part of the conversation we need to have in this country,\u201d said Chrissie Juliano of the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents the heads of more than 30 metropolitan health departments",
      "Smoking causes more than 480,000 U.S. deaths each year due to cancer, heart disease, stroke and other smoking-related illnesses. Those conditions often take decades to develop and remain elevated today despite ongoing declines in smoking among adults and teenagers.",
      "The idea of limiting nicotine has its roots in sweeping powers given to the FDA by Congress in 2009 to regulate the tobacco industry. But the FDA\u2019s efforts on nicotine and a host of other tobacco measures \u2014 such as adding graphic warning labels to cigarette packs \u2014 have been hampered for years by tobacco industry lawsuits.",
      "Under the law, FDA regulators can regulate nicotine but they cannot remove it completely. The agency's ability to set a maximum nicotine threshold is unique worldwide and the attempt would represent a first in global efforts to reduce smoking-related deaths.",
      "Currently, there are no U.S. limits on nicotine, which occurs naturally in tobacco plants. There are several techniques for removing it, including chemical extraction and cross-breeding plants.",
      "The FDA formally announced it would begin work on the proposed rule in 2022 and regulators received thousands of public comments from tobacco companies, retailers, health experts and consumers.",
      "The latest FDA announcement comes as smoking in the U.S. continues to fall. Last year, the smoking rate hit another all-time low of just 1 in 9 adults saying they currently smoke.",
      "Low-nicotine cigarettes are not a new idea. Several companies, including Philip Morris, experimented with selling the products during the 1980s and 1990s, without much success. In 2019, the FDA authorized a cigarette that contains 95% less nicotine than standard cigarettes.",
      "The FDA has sponsored studies showing that when smokers switch to very low nicotine cigarettes they smoke less and are more likely to try quitting. That research is considered pivotal to establishing that smokers won\u2019t compensate by just smoking more cigarettes or inhaling more deeply. That was sometimes the case with \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar\u201d cigarettes marketed in decades past. Those products were subsequently banned as misleading.",

They protect themselves from the virus with masks and isolate themselves in small family bubbles. Some grasp for unproven strategies \u2014 gargling with antiseptic mouthwash, carrying a personal carbon dioxide monitor to check the ventilation of indoor spaces.",

      "\u201cThere was more respect and understanding, but now they\u2019re over it,\" she said. \"They expect me to be over it, but they don\u2019t understand that even before COVID-19, these were the precautions I needed to take.\u201d",
      "Most Americans have developed some level of protection against severe disease from previous COVID-19 infections, vaccinations or both. But immunocompromised people like Scarbro, who has common variable immune deficiency, must be constantly vigilant. Unlike the flu, COVID has not settled into a seasonal pattern.",

      "Who are the people still cautious about COVID-19? They include young caregivers of vulnerable relatives, people with chronic health conditions and families rallying around a loved one. In interviews with The Associated Press, they talked about how they manage the trade-offs and the toll of isolation on their mental health.",
      "Before the pandemic, Bazia Zebrowski, 61, of Newbury, Ohio, dined out, shopped for groceries and took her dog, Shadoh, to the park. When she felt well, she occasionally could get together with friends despite having myalgic encephalomyelitis, a condition formerly known as chronic fatigue syndrome that causes inflammation, immune system problems, fatigue and pain.",
      "Now she keeps close to home, venturing out only for medical appointments. Her husband does the shopping and wears a mask at his workplace.",
      "They have not had COVID-19 and hope their luck holds. Getting sick would be a disaster, she said, potentially triggering a relapse or superimposing long COVID-19 onto her illness.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself COVID cautious. I consider myself COVID competent,\u201d Zebrowski said. \u201cCautious would imply that I have an unreasonable fear of something. I do not have an unreasonable fear of this disease.\u201d",
      "What does Zebrowski miss about pre-pandemic times? \u201cI miss the illusion that people are willing to care for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cHow hard is it to put a mask on? It rattles your faith in humankind \u2026 (you learn) how little the people in your life understood how sick you were to begin with.\u201d",
      "Trauma is part of the experience of having a chronic illness, said DePaul University psychologist Leonard Jason, who has studied myalgic encephalomyelitis for more than three decades.",
      "\u201cThen you're traumatized by the societal reaction to the illness,\" he said.",
      "Some people aren\u2019t sick themselves but are taking precautions to protect a family member. Steve Alejandro, 42, of Wentzville, Missouri, calls himself a COVID shielder.",
      "His wife, Ashley Alejandro, 44, also has myalgic encephalomyelitis. \u201cShe\u2019s got maybe four good hours a day,\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a thing in the world I wouldn\u2019t do to protect those four hours.\u201d",
      "Alejandro changed careers during the pandemic, leaving behind \u201cmy whole support system\u201d so he could sell vintage books online from home. His three children \u2014 now 20, 18 and 12 \u2014 never went back to in-person school after lockdowns ended and are continuing their learning at home.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve really come together,\u201d Alejandro said. \u201cThis is a choice that can be made and you can win at it.\u201d",
      "In Miami, Kira Levin is the primary caregiver for her 98-year-old grandmother. She said the thought of getting COVID-19 and risking her grandmother\u2019s health is terrifying.",
      "So, at a July wedding, the 29-year-old was the only bridesmaid and attendee in a mask \u2014 an N95 layered with a pretty mask to match the bride\u2019s green color scheme.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t take off the mask for pictures and nobody asked me to,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd I felt incredibly grateful for that.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe have done everything we possibly could to maintain our mental health and our social life,\u201d said Jacqueline, who has an immune disease that makes her vulnerable to infections. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than being disabled and isolated. As someone who has been disabled and isolated, I don\u2019t want that isolation part.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline, 30, and her sister Alexa, 34, launched a dating app in 2022 for people who are disabled or chronically ill, though all are welcomed. Users can add a \u201cCOVID Cautious\u201d tag to their profiles to signal they\u2019re interested in meeting others who take precautions. The Child sisters say 10% of their 30,000 users add \u201cCOVID Cautious\u201d to their dating profiles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a market that we didn\u2019t expect to target but we happily accept,\u201d Jacqueline said.",
      "Alexa said the precautions started as a way to protect Jacqueline, \u201cbut they\u2019re no longer about that.\u201d She\u2019s trying to avoid long COVID, a long-term disability.",
      "Tossing aside the threat of long COVID is hard to imagine for Yale University immunologist Akiko Iwasaki. Though people have been studying the virus since its emergence, she said scientists still don\u2019t know how pieces of the virus can stick around in the blood of some people for more than a year after they\u2019ve recovered from the illness.",
      "Iwasaki still wears masks indoors and stays up to date with vaccines.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t afford to get sick and become chronically ill,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that we really are in a position to be able to better understand the disease, to help millions of people.\u201d",
      "While Scarbro understands that others are ready to return to \u201cnormal,\u201d it\u2019s not that easy for her or her family. It's true for many others with chronic immune illnesses, said Jorey Berry, CEO of Immune Deficiency Foundation.",

      "And as the world turns back to pre-COVID life, Scarbro's family is doing what they can to keep her healthy \u2014 but not in complete isolation.",

      "People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",

      "AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity. In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, \"often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,\" White said.",

      "",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about half of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",

The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",

The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",

But falls are not inevitable, said Roopa Anmolsingh, a geriatrician who created the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s balance classes.",
      "\u201cSome people have a misconception that part of getting old is, you\u2019re going to fall. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Anmolsingh said. \u201cYou can control how you fall, or if you fall.\u201d",
      "To prevent falls, geriatricians say people should start asking themselves questions about their balance as early as 50 years old.",
      "Besides muscles and bones, other systems in the body can affect balance, so it\u2019s important to have a doctor check you if you ever feel unsteady, even if only occasionally. The cause could be related to blood pressure, a medication, inner-ear function, a nervous system issue or countless other potential problems.",
      "Even if unsteadiness is not an issue, you can determine whether you still might need an intervention with an easy at-home assessment.",
      "Standing next to a wall or something that can lend support if needed, raise one leg. If you can balance on each leg for 10 seconds, you should be fine, said Greg W. Hartley, a University of Miami professor of physical therapy specializing in geriatrics.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, then you should probably go see a physical therapist,\u201d he said.",
      "Another assessment, which Hartley recommended doing supervised, is called TUG, for \u201ctimed up and go.\u201d Sit in a chair and start a timer when you stand. Walk 10 feet (3 meters), come back and stop the timer upon sitting back down. If it takes longer than 15 seconds, the risk for a fall is very high. Twelve seconds or less, the likelihood of a fall is almost zero.",
      "The National Council on Aging offers an online resource to assess the risk of a fall with questions about medications, whether you worry about falling and if you have trouble stepping over a curb, among others.",
      "Because muscle mass begins to decline in most people during their 30s, geriatricians say the best way to preserve good balance is to stay physically active throughout life. But it\u2019s never too late to start prioritizing it, Anmolsingh said.",
      "Tai chi and yoga are particularly good for older adults because they involve controlled movements while shifting body weight. There also are individual exercises people can work into their everyday lives.",
      "Anmolsingh recommended standing on one foot while waiting in line at the grocery store. At home, try sitting up and down from a chair several times without using arm rests. While holding onto a chair or the wall, do three-way leg lifts on each side, lifting a leg to the front, side and then back. At the kitchen counter, take a few steps to the side in each direction.",
      "For general physical activity, which will improve balance as well as mood and overall health, the National Institute of Aging recommends at least 150 minutes per week. That should include a mixture of stretching to improve flexibility, an aerobic activity increasing the heart rate and strength training with weights or resistance bands.",
      "For balance-specific exercises, it\u2019s particularly important to do them regularly because it takes at least 50 hours of training to have a measurable impact, Hartley said. Besides strengthening the associated muscles, doing exercises repetitively for extended periods trains the brain to react properly when you slip or trip.",
      "\u201cJust like an athlete needs to do repetition to train for a sport, you\u2019re doing repetition to train for everyday balance activities,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "The week began with a biting cold snap that hammered much of the U.S., the product of a jet stream that slips out of its usual path more often these days",
      "It was a week of fire and ice.",
      "It began with millions of people across the U.S. shivering amid blizzard conditions and frigid air that lasted for days, thanks to a jet stream that slips out of its usual path more often these days. Then, catastrophe in California, with wind-whipped flames taking off in a landscape parched by months of drought to become Los Angeles' worst-ever wildfires.",
      "To cap it off, major weather monitoring agencies confirmed 2024 as the hottest year in global history. Even more dire, four of the six agencies said it was the first full year Earth went beyond a warming threshold seen as critical to limiting the worst effects of climate change.",
      "Welcome to one wild week of the climate crisis, scientists say. There will be more.",
      "\u201cFor the average person, this means the changes you\u2019re experiencing \u2014 more extreme weather, rising costs due to climate impacts, threats to food and water security \u2014 aren\u2019t anomalies,\u201d said Victor Gensini, a meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University. \u201cThey\u2019re the new normal unless we take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last week of weird weather has been alarming,\u201d said Natalie Mahowald, chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not a sign of things to come, because we\u2019ve barely seen any climate change compared to what we are going to get unless we radically cut CO2 emissions.\u201d",
      "Here's how the week unfolded.",
      "The cold came first.",
      "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, which means the difference between temperatures up north and down south are shrinking \u2014 along with sea ice that releases more heat into atmosphere. That means more energy bouncing off and warping or moving the polar vortex, scientists say. And climate change is also messing with the jet stream, the air currents that circle the globe.",
      "The result? More frequent blasts of intense cold in winter even as global temperatures heat up overall.",
      "The blizzard dumped more snow in some parts of Kansas than they usually get in a year, one Kansas State University meteorologist said. Ice-coated trees downed power lines in eastern Kentucky, and a U.S. Olympian skied on the National Mall in Washington.",
      "Farmers rushed to move cows to keep them from freezing to death and to feed and water them as rural roads became impassable. Travel stalled as multiple states warned motorists not to chance the treacherous snow and ice.",
      "About 200 people, many homeless, sheltered at a roller rink in Cincinnati. The alternative was frostbite or worse in exposure to temperatures that were expected to slip from freezing to sub-freezing overnight.",
      "Out West, wildfire took hold.",
      "The Palisades Fire erupted in the Santa Monica mountains and moved quickly on Santa Ana winds gusting to 100 mph \u2014 much faster than normal. The winds were so strong they grounded airplanes normally used to drop water on the flames.",
      "The blaze reached near the Getty Museum and by the end of the day, several celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, had lost homes. Less than 72 hours before, many stars had convened to walk the Golden Globes\u2019 red carpet.",
      "The Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, killing 2 people and closing about 10 school districts.",
      "Climate change laid the groundwork for California\u2019s megafires. Atmospheric rivers dumped huge amounts of water on the region that caused plenty of plant growth. Then, a fast onset of drought dried them out, providing plenty of fodder for the flames.",
      "The water system used to fight the Palisades fire in Los Angeles buckled in the morning, as some hydrants ran dry as they were overstressed without assistance from firefighting aircraft.",
      "The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was pumping from aqueducts and groundwater into the system, but demand was so high that it wasn\u2019t enough to refill three 1-million gallon tanks in hilly Pacific Palisades. At least 1,000 buildings were engulfed in flames.",
      "The Sunset Fire started, too, threatening the Hollywood Hills and forcing mandatory evacuations in Hollywood.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump criticized state and local officials' water management policies. But experts said critics were connecting unrelated issues and spreading false information during a crisis.",
      "By the afternoon, calmer winds aided firefighters in making some headway, though by that point at least five fires were still active and some burned out of control in the L.A. area.",
      "Scenes of the destruction started to emerge. Recovery crews pulled a body from the rubble of a beachfront residence in Malibu.",
      "AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, estimated the overall wildfire damage could reach $57 billion, though much of the destruction remains to be surveyed.",
      "At the same time, another winter storm bore down on the South, with warnings and advisories for at least 20 states. Many had gone through the same thing just days earlier.",
      "Major weather monitoring agencies said 2024 was the hottest since record-keeping began, easily passing 2023.",
      "Even more significant: 2024 was the first year with a global average that broke the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s that was set as a goal by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.",
      "Extreme weather like this week's is \u201caffecting so many more people all at one time,\u201d said Barbara Hofer, a professor emerita of psychology at Middlebury College. \u201cIncreasingly, the scale is changing. The loss is mounting.\"",
      "Hofer said the growing impact may make some people deny climate change, ignore it or become numb to it as \u201ca way to avoid what's psychologically uncomfortable.\"",
      "Such a week can also energize positive change, she said. But Hofer said she thinks that will be harder, at least in the U.S., as Trump takes office. He's promised to halt federal climate action and repeal existing legislation aimed at the problem.",
      "\u201cI worry about the denial, the misinformation, and the forces that are feeding that denial,\" she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have to address.\u201d",

      "A California man says his two cats died and a third was hospitalized after he fed them raw milk recalled for bird flu risk",
      "A California man whose two cats died after drinking raw milk recalled for bird flu risk says he meant to keep his beloved pets healthy, but his efforts tragically backfired.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when you realize that you\u2019re the one that actually gave them the milk that killed them,\u201d said Joseph Journell, 56, of San Bernardino.",
      "Journell lost his 14-year-old tabby, Alexander, and Tuxsie, a 4-year-old tuxedo cat, in late November. A third cat, 4-year-old Big Boy, was hospitalized for a week before tests showed the animal was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.",
      "The cats drank unpasteurized milk from lots recalled by Raw Farm, of Fresno, whose dairy products were pulled from California store shelves in December after health officials found the virus in milk for sale, he said. The animals' deaths were confirmed by state and county health officials. The cats were kept indoors, with no access to potentially infected birds, and ate conventional, not raw, pet food, the owner said.",
      "Journell said he had been drinking Raw Farm milk himself for several months because he heard it had \u201cbetter immunity and healing properties\u201d than pasteurized milk. He thought it might be able to help Alexander, who had been losing weight.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make him healthier and make him live longer,\u201d Journell said.",
      "Instead, Alexander died on Thanksgiving Day. Tuxsie followed two days later.",
      "Big Boy was hospitalized and treated with antiviral medications, Journell said. The veterinary team collected urine samples from the cat, which were confirmed positive for H5N1 at labs run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and Cornell University, records show.",
      "Big Boy returned home blind and without the use of his back legs, though he is recovering, Journell said. A fourth cat, Cleo, didn\u2019t drink the milk and remained healthy.",
      "Journell has demanded that Raw Farm owner Mark McAfee compensate him for the more than $12,000 he spent treating the cats, according Seattle food safety lawyer Ilana Korchia, who is representing him.",
      "In an interview, McAfee disputed that the virus was capable of sickening the animals days after it was bottled and sold, citing preliminary research.",
      "But Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said flu virus survival likely varies widely in different lots of milk. Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed that cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological disease and died.",
      "\u201cI think the poor cats are the best indicator!\u201d Webby wrote in an email.",
      "Nearly a dozen cats in California have died since early December after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with bird flu, health officials have said.",
      "The infections have followed a massive outbreak of the bird flu virus in dairy cows, which has affected in more than 900 U.S. dairy herds in 16 states. About 80% of those herds are in California.",
      "Federal and state health officials have warned people not to drink raw milk because of the potential for infection with bird flu and a host of other germs. Officials also have cautioned pet owners to avoid feeding unpasteurized milk and raw meat diets to their animals.",
      "\u201cCats should not be fed any products from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to kill the virus,\u201d the FDA warned last month.",
      "After the cats got sick, Journell said he fell ill himself and sought care at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fontana, Calif. He said he wasn't checked for bird flu, despite his known exposure to the virus, because medical staff didn't have tests available to detect it.",
      "A Kaiser spokesperson declined to comment on Journell's case specifically, but said the hospital system is following CDC guidelines for screening for bird flu.",
      "Journell has recovered physically but said he's still suffering from the \u201cmental anguish\" of losing his pets. Despite the ordeal, he said he still thinks raw milk offers some health benefits.",
      "Nevertheless, he won't be drinking it any time soon.",
      "\u201cNot right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not in the foreseeable future.\u201d",

      "The District of Columbia on Friday filed a lawsuit against the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, arguing it has inflicted \u201ccatastrophic harm\u201d on the mostly poor and minority communities living along the urban waterway.",
      "The lawsuit argues that federal government, which owns and controls the riverbed, has since the 1800s dumped toxic waste, heavy metals and chemicals including carcinogenic PCBs in the river and refused to clean it up. The 9-mile (14-kilometer) river flows through Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. For decades, it was treated as a municipal dumping ground for industrial waste, storm sewers and trash. That contamination largely affected communities of color.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that PCBs from the Washington Navy Yard were dumped in the river along with hazardous chemicals from the Kenilworth Landfill and chemical waste from federal printing facilities. It also blamed the federal government for poorly managing the District of Columbia's sewer system, which led to the dumping of raw sewage and toxic waste into the river.",
      "That pollution has led to swimming bans and warnings about fishing along the river, the lawsuit alleges, calling the federal government its biggest polluter.",
      "\u201cIt has systematically contaminated the River through the indiscriminate dumping and release of hazardous substances and through destructive dredge and fill operations,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said pollutants in the river don't break down and cause long-lasting harm to the environment, aquatic wildlife, and human health, including cancer, neurological and developmental disorders and birth defects.",
      "The District of Columbia is demanding that the federal government pay for the river's cleanup.",
      "The lawsuit comes as the District of Columbia has made progress in cleaning up the river and returning to a time where residents fished and boated and wildlife including bald eagles, osprey, cranes, kingfishers and eel thrived there.",
      "A $3.29 billion sewer upgrade, including a series of tunnels drilled under the city to capture storm and sewage water, has reduced overflows into the river by 91%, according to DC Water, the city\u2019s water utility. The final section of the Anacostia Tunnel System went online in 2023, and the overall system is expected to reduce overflows by 98%.",
      "Pepco, the city\u2019s utility, also reached an agreement with the District of Columbia to pay more than $57 million for discharging hazardous chemicals from their power plants into soil, groundwater and storm sewers for decades that polluted the Anacostia and other areas. The settlement was believed to be the largest in the utility\u2019s history.",
      "The payments will be used in part to clean up the river. Other measures the city government instituted like a fee on plastic bags since 2009 have also helped keep trash out, experts say.",
      "Still, the Anacostia remains polluted. It received a failing grade for the third time in six years in 2023 from a nonprofit that grades the river\u2019s health based on its fecal bacteria content and the state of its aquatic vegetation.",

      "NEW YORK -- When Justin Stewart started his career, he juggled several jobs to make ends meet. He poured himself into his full-time role as a news show production assistant from 3 a.m. until noon. Then he rushed to the airport where he rented cars or to the big box stores where he pulled retail shifts.",
      "Sometimes, he slept in his car between jobs. Then he was hospitalized for exhaustion and a staph infection.",
      "\u201cWhile people around me praised my hustle, I eventually paid the price,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe doctor looked at me and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what lifestyle you\u2019re living, but you\u2019re too young to be this stressed. You\u2019re going to have to quit something.'\"",
      "So Stewart, now 36, began setting boundaries. He gave up the side jobs, deciding he could survive without extra income. If people from the news show texted him after-hours, he let them know he was off-duty and where else to call.",
      "Setting boundaries at work, and in life, can be tricky. Many people find it difficult to say no, especially to a manager. Some get a sense of satisfaction from being needed or pleasing others.",
      "But learning to turn down a request or invitation is essential for protecting our physical and mental health, experts say. And as with any new skill, drawing boundaries gets easier with practice.",
      "Experts in well-being and organizational behavior, along with other workers, shared strategies for setting limits.",
      "Adding tasks to your calendar may seem counterintuitive if scaling back is the goal, but can provide more control over your time.",
      "Bobby Dutton, the founder of event production company GBM6, uses a technique he calls \u201caggressive calendering.\u201d He schedules the task he\u2019s most likely to procrastinate on, such as handling contracts and invoices, for every Monday at 2 p.m. To keep his calendar from becoming overloaded, he also books time for recurring routine tasks like making coffee, walking the dog and eating lunch.",
      "If you\u2019re unaccustomed to saying no, you can write down what you\u2019re going to say beforehand and rehearse it. Stewart worked on letting colleagues know when his assignment load began feeling too heavy with phrases like \u201cHey, this is a lot for me\" or \"You gave me seven stories, I think I can get four or five done.\u201d",
      "Cara Houser, a workplace engagement coach, says you don\u2019t have to explain yourself when declining a request. You can simply say you\u2019re not available at that time, followed by \u201cThanks for asking, and I hope to have more capacity next time.\u201d",
      "If the recipient of your \u201cno\u201d tries to argue, you can respond, \u201cI hear you feel that way. But for me, this is what I\u2019ve decided to do for that day,\u201d Houser said.",
      "Entrepreneur Amber Krasinski grew up in a working-class environment where saying no to a boss could mean losing a paycheck. As the founder of marketing company IvyHill Strategies, Krasinski worries she'll lose clients if she turns down a project. \u201cNot yet\u201d is her go-to phrase when one more project is too much.",
      "\u201cThat phrase has helped me through a lot of situations,\u201d she said.",
      "It can be tempting to agree immediately when we're asked to chip in. But there may be times when we're better off demurring. When faced with a new work request, take five minutes to assess your workload, energy level and priorities before responding, suggests Israa Nasir, a psychotherapist in New York.",
      "Nasir says a former boss frequently texted work-related questions at 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. \u201cI didn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t text me,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2019Can we check in on Fridays before the weekend? So everything that\u2019s on your mind, you can (tell me) and then I can plan my time accordingly.\u201d",
      "Pay attention to the activities and interactions that leave you feeling drained or overwhelmed, Nasir said. Put those kinds of events on a \u201cNo List.\" The list doesn't mean you decline every time you're asked, but don't say yes right away, she advises.",
      "Mobile devices make it easier to work from anywhere, and harder to draw boundaries. But there are ways to adjust our devices so they're less distracting.",
      "After noticing that she checked email far too frequently on weekends, Nasir starting moving the Gmail app from her iPhone\u2019s homepage to the second page from Friday night to Sunday night.",
      "An email signature is another tool you can use to manage expectations, by publishing working hours or upcoming vacation schedules, said Candice Pokk, a senior consultant in organizational effectiveness at Segal Consulting.",
      "Pokk includes a \u201cWell Being Notice\u201d at the bottom of her emails which reads, \u201cReceiving this email outside normal working hours? Managing a work-life balance is unique for everyone. I have sent this email at a time that works for me. Please respond at a time that works for you.\u201d",
      "With the popularity of online meeting software, it's easy for others to overload your calendar with invitations. Accepting every one can leave little time for other work.",
      "Janine Pelosi, CEO of Oslo-based video technology company Neat, thinks workers should be able to leave a meeting that's not relevant to them, if it's an environment where that's accepted.",
      "If you're unsure it's worthwhile to attend, you can request an agenda in advance, or ask what is the desired outcome, she said.",
      "Publisher Lori Perkins, 65, was working 12 to 16 hours daily when a cancer diagnosis halted her routine. During chemotherapy, she could only muster up enough energy to put in four hours a day, and even then felt like she was working \u201cin a vat of molasses.\u201d",
      "After treatment, \"I realized I was going to live, and then I said to myself, \u2018Do I want to continue doing this?\u2019\u201d Perkins said.",
      "She now caps her work as owner of Riverdale Avenue Books at about 50 hours per week, and as a result can't review as many manuscripts. Instead of sending rejection letters, she tells authors to come back in three to six months when it's less hectic.",
      "She practices saying \u201cno\u201d in her head and in her journal, where she also chronicles what happened after she said it. She's gained time to visit museums, friends and the theater.",

      "An annual U.S. government report on \u201cnotorious markets\u201d known for counterfeiting and other violations of intellectual property says that nearly all 35,000 online pharmacies around the world are being run illegally",
      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "Officials now say they are closer than ever to reaching an agreement to pause the Israel-Hamas war and release hostages held in the Gaza Strip",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- With a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas tantalizingly close, families of hostages in the Gaza Strip are afraid to get their hopes up and agonizing over the unknown.",
      "\u201cThese days are horrible for us,\u201d Yafit Zailer said Wednesday, breaking down into sobs over the thought of her relatives \u2014 Shiri and Yarden Bibas and their two small children, Ariel and Kfir \u2014 being released after 15 months of captivity.",
      "\u201cI want to know already if they\u2019re coming back,\" Zailer said. \"I want to know already if they\u2019re OK or not. I want to hold my cousin in my arms and celebrate the biggest celebration.\u201d",
      "The United States, Egypt and Qatar have spent the past year trying to mediate an end to the war sparked by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel and the release of dozens of hostages captured that day. Officials now say they are closer than ever to announcing an agreement.",
      "Even if a deal is reached, the torment experienced by families of the hostages and war-weary Palestinians in Gaza could be far from over.",
      "Families of the hostages do not know whether their loved ones are alive or dead, and many will have to wait for a subsequent phase of the agreement that has yet to be negotiated.",
      "In war-ravaged Gaza, many displaced Palestinians do not know if their homes are still standing, thousands are still buried under rubble and dozens are missing after encounters with Israeli forces. Vast areas appear uninhabitable, and it could take decades to rebuild.",
      "If talks over the second \u2014 and more difficult \u2014 phase of the emerging ceasefire deal break down, the war could resume, bringing even more death, destruction and displacement to Gaza and an even longer wait for families of the hostages.",
      "Shiri and Yarden Bibas and their two red-haired sons, 5-year-old Ariel and Kfir \u2014 who will turn 2 on Saturday \u2014 were among the roughly 250 hostages dragged into Gaza in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war, in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed.",
      "Kfir, who was then 9 months old, was the youngest to be taken captive. The infant with red hair and a toothless smile, who has been in captivity for almost two thirds of his life, has become a symbol across Israel for the helplessness and anger over the hostages\u2019 plight.",
      "Shiri, Ariel and Kfir were supposed to be released with other women and children during a ceasefire in November 2023, but it fell apart after a week. All four members of the family were on a list obtained by The Associated Press that named 33 hostages who could be released in the initial six-week phase of the draft agreement.",
      "\u201cI want to tell all the parties involved in the negotiations, it\u2019s time to end this,\" Zailer said, tears streaming down her face. \u201cIt\u2019s time to bring home our people, it\u2019s time to end this war.\u201d",
      "Daniel Lifshitz' 84-year-old grandfather, Oded, is being held captive in Gaza along with many of his friends. His grandmother was released shortly after the initial attack.",
      "As he waits for news, Lifshitz scrolls through his phone looking for updates and reaches out to the hostage negotiators for positive signs. The less they respond, the more optimistic things look, he said of his experience with them. But even the announcement of a deal would provide only some relief.",
      "\u201cAnother roller coaster is coming \u2014 is he alive or not? Should I prepare (for) a funeral or should I prepare (for) a celebration?\u201d said Lifshitz. It's something his family doesn't want to discuss.",
      "Some 100 hostages remain captive inside Gaza, a mix of civilians and soldiers, as well as around a dozen foreign nationals from Thailand, Nepal and Tanzania. The military believes at least a third of the remaining hostages \u2014 and up to half of them \u2014 are dead.",
      "The three-phased agreement would begin with the release of 33 women, children, older adults and wounded civilians in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian women and children imprisoned by Israel. Soldiers and other male captives would be released in the second phase.",
      "Herut Nimrodi's son, Tamir, was abducted from his army base on Oct. 7. The now 20-year-old soldier won't be included in the deal's first phase, and she worries that if the ceasefire doesn't hold, pressure to release the remaining hostages will decline because there will be fewer of them.",
      "Hamas says it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayahu has vowed to continue the offensive until Hamas' military and governing abilities are destroyed.",
      "If no agreement is reached on the second phase, the war could resume this spring.",
      "For hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians living in squalid tent camps and fearing Israeli airstrikes, the end of the war cannot come soon enough. Previous breakdowns in the talks have been followed by renewed Israeli offensives.",
      "\u201cThe best thing right now, immediately, without any delay, would be to stop everything and announce a truce,\" said Sulaiman Qasem, a coordinator with a medical charity in Gaza City. \u201cLast night the shelling and bombing here didn\u2019t stop for a moment ... It's absolute madness.\"",
      "The war has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between fighters and civilians, but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. Israel\u2019s offensive has reduced large areas of the strip to rubble and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million, leaving many at risk of famine.",
      "Rola Saqer's daughter was born on the first day of the war, and nearly every day since has been a struggle to find safety, food and health care.",
      "The family fled their apartment and was forced to live in a cramped tent with other relatives. Saqer said her daughter, Massa Zaqout, has difficulty walking and worries the lack of proper nutrients will affect her development.",
      "The proposed ceasefire deal includes a surge of humanitarian aid, and would allow Palestinians to start returning to their homes, assuming they still exist.",
      "\u201cWe have no strength left,\u00a8 said Rami Abu Shera, who was displaced from his home in Khan Younis. \u201cWe are waiting for there to be no blood, no killings, no wounded, no destruction, no displacement. It is enough,\u201d he said.",

      "Rescuers and volunteers have pulled at least 78 dead miners and more than 160 survivors from an abandoned South African gold mine",
      "STILFONTEIN, South Africa -- Rescuers and volunteers have pulled at least 78 dead miners and more than 160 survivors from an abandoned South African gold mine, where they have languished for over two months during a standoff with authorities who demanded they surrender to police because they were mining illegally.",
      "Hundreds are still believed to be trapped Wednesday and the death toll is expected to rise in a disaster that has focused criticism on the South African government\u2019s decision to try to \u201csmoke them out\u201d by cutting off food and other supplies for a time. Civic groups claim authorities also removed the ropes and pulley systems that the miners used to enter and exit at least one shaft and send down supplies.",
      "The groups say the government's weekslong refusal to stage a rescue effectively left scores of miners to die of starvation or dehydration. A rescue is now underway \u2014 after a court order \u2014 but only a few miners can be pulled up at a time, and the operation could take 10 days.",
      "South African authorities have argued that the miners were always able to exit through another shaft at Buffelsfontein Gold Mine, one of the deepest in the mineral-rich country.",
      "But activists said that would involve a dangerous trek underground that could take days for some, and many became too weak or ill after months underground with little food and water. Police contend some miners refused to come out.",
      "In response to a request by a relative of one of the miners, a court last week ordered a rescue operation, which began Monday. A specialist mining rescue company has been dropping a small cage thousands of meters (feet) into the mine to retrieve survivors and bodies. But no personnel from the company entered the shaft because they consider it too dangerous \u2014 instead community volunteers headed down in the cage to help the miners out.",
      "Police first tried to force the miners out of the closed mine near the town of Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg, in November by cutting off their supplies. The move, part of a larger crackdown on illegal mining, began a standoff between authorities and the miners and members of the community.",
      "A court ruled that authorities had to allow supplies in \u2014 but civic groups argue that officials needed to do more at that point because even without police interference the miners weren't able to get enough food and water into the mine and the situation was becoming dire.",
      "The mine is 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) deep with multiple shafts, many levels and a maze of tunnels. A group representing the miners said there are numerous groups in various parts of the mine and estimated that more than 500 miners were underground when the rescue started.",
      "It's unclear exactly how long they've been underground, but relatives say some of them have been there since July.",
      "Police said Wednesday that 78 bodies have been recovered so far, and 166 survivors brought out since the official rescue operation began. A community group says another nine bodies were recovered on Friday and an unconfirmed number in the previous weeks after members of the community attempted to rescue miners themselves.",
      "Civic groups representing the miners say at least 100 have died.",
      "The official rescue is now proceeding slowly because only a few people can fit in the cage at a time and because the shaft is so deep.",
      "Authorities have argued that the miners could have exited if they wanted to \u2014 and police say more than 1,000 did before the rescue operation \u2014 but they didn't because they feared arrest. Police say they have arrested everyone who has surfaced both before and after the rescue operation.",
      "They will face charges of illegal mining and trespassing. Authorities seized gold, explosives, firearms and more than $2 million in cash from the miners.",
      "One of the civic groups representing the miners released two videos over the weekend showing what it said were the dire conditions underground. The videos were on a cellphone carried out of the mine by one of the miners, the group said, along with a note urging people to watch them.",
      "In them, dozens of what appear to be dead bodies can be seen lined up in a darkened cavern and wrapped in plastic. They also show shirtless, emaciated-looking miners while the man filming says they are dying and begs for authorities to send them food and get them out.",
      "Authorities are particularly under fire for their tactics last year, when they cut off food and other supplies to the miners underground for a period of time. It was an attempt to \u201csmoke them out,\u201d a South African Cabinet minister said, adding that authorities would not help the miners because they were \u201ccriminals.\u201d",
      "Rights groups have condemned the plan, accusing authorities of contributing to a \u201cmassacre\u201d at the mine, and members of the community have also gathered at the mine holding placards criticizing the authorities.",
      "But while anger is high in the local community, the tragedy has not stoked a strong reaction across South Africa, where illegal mining is often in the news.",
      "The practice is common at mines that companies have closed because they are no longer profitable, leaving groups of informal miners to enter in a search for leftover deposits. South Africa has an estimated 6,000 abandoned mines.",
      "The South African government has taken a hard-line approach to the groups, who are known as zama zamas \u2014 which means \u201chustlers\u201d in the Zulu language \u2014 and have long been a problem for authorities. They are often armed and part of criminal syndicates, the government says, and many are foreigners who entered South Africa illegally from neighboring countries.",
      "The government says they are robbing South Africa of more than $1 billion a year in gold.",
      "Authorities said that more than 1,500 people have been arrested for mining illegally in the Stilfontein area over the last year, with the vast majority of them from Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Lesotho.",

      "The comments by Mohammad Javad Zarif, a former foreign minister who serves as vice president for strategic affairs for reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, appear aimed at explaining to the country\u2019s disaffected public the challenges Iran's government faces under crushing Western sanctions over the program. The comments also acknowledged details previously reported in Israel about a 2021 attack on Iran's underground Natanz nuclear enrichment facility.",
      "The revelation, released this week, shows the danger still facing Iran after Israel struck the country twice during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip \u2014 and threatens to directly target its nuclear sites as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to re-enter the White House next week.",
      "Zarif made the remarks in an interview with a program affiliated with the Institute for the Compilation and Publication of Imam Khomeini\u2019s Works, a publicly funded organization in Iran. Politicians from Iran's reformist camp, which seeks to change Iran's Shiite theocracy from within, often seek different media outlets to reach the public as Iranian state television is controlled by hard-liners.",
      "Zarif, who helped Iran reach its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, discussed a sabotage attack launched by Israel's Mossad intelligence agency targeting pagers and radios used by the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah in September. The two waves of attacks killed 42 people and wounded thousands more, setting the stage for Israel's invasion of Lebanon in October.",
      "\u201cThis is part of the damage of sanctions, that you are forced to receive (purchases) through multiple dealers instead of buying from a factory directly,\" Zarif said. \"If the Zionist regime can infiltrate one of the dealers, then it can do anything and install anything.\u201d",
      "He added: \"For instance, our friends at the Atomic Energy Organization (of Iran) had purchased a platform for centrifuges in which (the Israelis) had installed explosive material.\u201d",
      "Zarif did not elaborate, and the interviewer did not press him on the issue.",
      "However, it marked the first clear acknowledgment of the degree Mossad had infiltrated Iran's program.",
      "In July 2020, a mysterious explosion tore apart Natanz\u2019s advanced centrifuge assembly, which Iran blamed on Israel. In April 2021, another blast tore apart one of its underground enrichment halls.",
      "A few months later, Israel's outgoing Mossad chief Yossi Cohen gave an interview to Israeli television in which he all but acknowledged his spies executed the two attacks. The show said a saboteur \u201cmade sure to supply to the Iranians the marble foundation on which the centrifuges are placed\" that included \"an enormous amount of explosives.\u201d",
      "The attacks happened under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has led Israel through the Mideast wars since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Since then, Israel's war targeting Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, according to health authorities there.",
      "As mediators say Israel and Hamas are the closest they've been to a ceasefire, concerns have grown over Iran's nuclear program. Since Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from an international accord greatly restricting Iran's program, Tehran has broken through all limits of the deal.",
      "Iran now enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels and has a growing stockpile of enriched uranium. Its officials increasingly threaten to seek an atomic bomb.",
      "Iranian officials insist their nuclear program is peaceful and they want to negotiate with the West over it.",
      "\u201cThe problem we have is not in dialogue,\u201d Pezeshkian told NBC News in an interview aired Tuesday night. \u201cIt\u2019s in the commitments that arise from talk and dialogue that we\u2019ll have to commit to.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe upheld all the commitments that we had to commit to. But unfortunately it was the other party that did not live up to its promises and obligations.\u201d",
      "Israel, President Joe Biden and Trump have repeatedly warned they will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. That's raised fears of a preemptive Israeli strike targeting Iranian nuclear sites, something Israel has done in both Iraq and Syria.",
      "Asked about the possibility of such a strike, Pezeshkian said: \u201cWe do not fear war, but we don't seek it.\"",

      "LONDON -- Britain\u2019s new government, which is already facing anger over higher taxes, unpopular spending decisions and political scandals just six months after taking office, is now being battered by rising borrowing costs that threaten to derail its left-leaning program.",
      "The yield on the U.K.\u2019s 10-year bonds, a reflection of the price investors demand for financing the country\u2019s debt, has risen by more than 1.1 percentage points since Sept. 16 on concerns over sluggish economic growth and stubbornly high inflation. That has pushed Britain\u2019s borrowing costs to the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "As borrowing costs rise, the government has less money to spend on the country\u2019s creaking National Health Service, military, emergency services and schools. Though officials got a brief respite when the rate of inflation dropped slightly in December, if things don\u2019t turn around quickly Prime Minister Keir Starmer may have to rethink promises to boost spending and avoid tax increases on \u201cworking people\u201d that helped his Labour Party win a landslide election victory in July.",
      "The problems are partly due to the return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose pledge to increases taxes on imported goods has sent shivers through the world economy and boosted global bond yields. But the problem is partly of the government\u2019s own making, as Treasury chief Rachel Reeves built her economic plan on the assumption that economic growth would boost tax revenue.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at Britain's economy and the possible implications.",
      "Bond investors around the world have been spooked by concerns over Trump\u2019s plan to impose high tariffs on imported goods will push up U.S. consumer prices, prompting the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer, said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the U.K. investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. Higher prices tend to lead to higher borrowing costs as bondholders seek to ensure that their investment isn\u2019t eroded by inflation.",
      "Only a few months ago, investors were betting the Fed would approve multiple rate cuts this year. Now they\u2019re anticipating just one.",
      "\u201cThe rise in gilt yields since the early autumn appears to largely be the result of global factors, rather than any decision the U.K. government has taken in recent weeks or months, and appears to largely reflect market expectations for higher central bank interest rates in the years ahead,\u201d the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank that focuses on U.K. government policies, said last week.",
      "Gilts are a type of bond issued by the U.K. government that are traded on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "No, borrowing costs are rising in many countries, including the U.S.",
      "But Britain is particularly exposed because of the state of its economy and high levels of government debt.",
      "Consumer price inflation dipped to 2.5% in the 12 months through December, from 2.6% the previous month. That's still some ways away from the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target.",
      "The British economy has basically flatlined in recent months. The latest government statistics showed that gross domestic product was stagnant in the three months through September, after growing 0.7% in the first quarter and 0.4% in the second.",
      "That\u2019s partly due to the government\u2019s decision to boost payroll taxes paid by employers and increase workplace regulation, causing some companies to curtail investment and hiring.",
      "\u201cThe U.K. is also now in the eye of the storm,\u2019\u2019 Streeter said, adding that \u201cstagflation fears are taking hold.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith concerns that there\u2019s a stagnating economy, inflation has veered away from the Bank of England\u2019s target. And that\u2019s also made investors nervous about holding U.K. government debt,\u201d she said.",
      "U.K. government debt stood at more than 98% of economic output in November. That's the highest level since 1963, when Britain was still paying down its debts from World War II.",
      "Reeves was counting on economic growth to help reduce debt as a percentage of GDP. She also introduced new fiscal rules that will bar the government from borrowing to fund day-to-day spending by 2030, while pledging not to raise taxes on \u201cworking people.\u201d",
      "Higher borrowing costs will make meeting those goals more difficult. Even so, it would be difficult for Reeves to abandon her promises, said Paul Johnson, the institute\u2019s director.",
      "\u2033She\u2019s really nailed her colors to the mast there and we\u2019ve seen that the markets are pretty concerned about the U.K position,\u2019\u2019 Johnson told the BBC last weekend. \u201cThat's partly because we are so dependent on international flows of finance to finance our debt and indeed to finance things like our trade deficit with countries like China.\u2019\u2019",
      "All this means the new Labour government has had to take risks, such as reaching out to China to boost trade and business ties despite critics raising national security concerns.",
      "Reeves recently made a three-day trip to China, seeking investment rather than staying home and trying to calm the markets. While some derided the trip, Reeves insisted that China offered Britain an opportunity to drive growth that it cannot ignore.",
      "\u201cChoosing not to engage with China is therefore no choice at all,\u2019\u2019 she wrote in the Times of London.",
      "Reeves may run out of options if borrowing costs stay high, curtailing the amount of money she has to spend.",
      "A policy shift could come as early as March 26, when Reeves is due to update Parliament on the country\u2019s financial position and the Office for Budget Responsibility will update its economic and fiscal forecasts.",
      "\u201cUltimately, investors shouldn\u2019t panic,\u2019\u2019 Streeter said. \u201cFinancial markets can be wracked with volatility, but over the longer term, that does tend to even out.\u201d"

      "ABUJA, Nigeria -- The Nigerian military has mistakenly killed hundreds of civilians in airstrikes targeting armed groups in the nation's conflict-battered north over the years, many of them locals bombed in their villages.",
      "The latest misfire was on Saturday when the Nigerian air force bombarded rebels in the conflict-battered northwestern Zamfara State but ended up erroneously killing civilians working with a community security outfit, the state government said. Residents told the Associated Press that at least 20 civilians were killed.",
      "Since 2017, the military has killed about 400 civilians, according to SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based research firm that gathered reports and data from affected villages regarding the airstrikes.",

      "Nigeria's Defense Chief Gen. Christopher Musa has said the military has been improving its human rights record and is holding its personnel to account.",
      "Besides the Boko Haram Islamic extremist group which launched an insurgency in 2009 to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, in the northeast, there have been dozens of armed groups.",
      "They are mostly former herdsmen caught up in decadeslong conflict with farming communities over access to land and water. Once armed with sticks, the groups now carry out attacks with guns that have been smuggled into the country, resulting in roughly thousands of deaths yearly.",
      "The armed groups carry out mass killings and kidnappings for ransom in the northwest and central regions. They also extort taxes from the communities they terrorize, using the funds to support their operations in addition to the money gotten from ransom payments, analysts said.",
      "These armed groups operate in vast forest enclaves, planning and launching attacks that sometimes last for days in villages with inadequate security presence. They rarely remain in one location for long, frequently relocating and blending in with local communities to evade detection.",
      "As a result, the Nigerian military often relies on airstrikes to target the rebels as they move around and in their hideouts, especially in areas where ground assaults are difficult.",
      "Authorities say it can be challenging to avoid civilian casualties in air raids because armed groups often use civilians as human shields.",
      "\u201cBandits and terrorists, unlike professional soldiers, don\u2019t respect the rules of engagement. They don\u2019t care about killing their hostages if they come under attack,\u201d Nigeria\u2019s former President Muhammadu Buhari once said.",
      "However, the frequent mistakes resulting in civilian deaths can be also attributed to loopholes in intelligence gathering as well as insufficient coordination between ground troops, air assets, and stakeholders, said Senator Iroegbu, an Abuja-based security analyst.",
      "The Nigerian government and military often promise to investigate the accidental airstrikes to prevent a reoccurrence. Analysts, however, say the problem has persisted and such investigations often don't lead to anything.",
      "In 2024, the Nigerian military took a rare measure to prosecute two of its personnel over an accidental airstrike that killed over 80 civilians in Kaduna State. It also promised to release the report of its investigation into the incident but has not done so.",
      "One key step is improved investment in pilot training and aircrew development as well as upgrading aircraft and targeting systems,\" said Oluwole Ojewale with the Africa-focused Institute for Security Studies.",
      "The military needs to also build trust and secure the support of local communities, whose intelligence on armed group movements is crucial to accurately target and defeat them, he said."

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is visiting Poland after the two countries reached an agreement on a longstanding source of tensions between them: the exhumation of Polish victims of World War II-era massacres by Ukrainian nationalists",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was visiting Poland on Wednesday after the two countries reached an agreement on a longstanding source of tensions between them: the exhumation of Polish victims of World War II-era massacres by Ukrainian nationalists.",
      "The office of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said early Wednesday he would welcome Zelenskyy in the late morning, and that the two would hold a joint news conference shortly after noon local time.",
      "The visit comes just days after Tusk announced progress on the issue of the exhumations, an issue that has strained relations for years.",
      "\u201cFinally a breakthrough. There is a decision on the first exhumations of Polish victims of the UPA,\" Tusk wrote on the social platform X on Friday, referring to the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. \u201cI thank the ministers of culture of Poland and Ukraine for their good cooperation. We are waiting for further decisions.\u201d",
      "A non-governmental group, the Freedom and Democracy Foundation, said Monday it will begin exhumation work on victims in Ukraine in April.",
      "Although Poland has been one of Ukraine's most stalwart supporters since Russia's full-scale invasion nearly three years ago, the issue of the Polish victims lying in mass graves in Ukrainian soil eight decades after they were killed has left a festering bitterness among many Poles.",
      "It also has put pressure on Tusk, who is seeking to show progress on an issue of continued importance to many people in Poland. It is particularly important as his party's candidate in a presidential election in May is expected to face a strong challenge from a nationalist opposition candidate.",
      "The issue dates back to 1943-44, when Europe was at war. Ukrainian nationalists massacred about 100,000 Poles in Volhynia and other regions that were then in eastern Poland, under Nazi German occupation, and which are now part of Ukraine.",
      "Entire villages were burned down and their inhabitants killed by the nationalists and their helpers who were seeking to establish an independent Ukraine state. Poland considers the events a genocide and has been asking Ukraine to let them exhume the victims to give them proper burials.",
      "An estimated 15,000 Ukrainians were killed in retaliation.",
      "The issue is difficult for Ukraine because some of the World War II-era Ukrainian nationalists are regarded as national heroes due to their struggle for Ukraine's statehood.",
      "As the two sides moved to resolve the issue, the chairman of Ukraine\u2019s parliament in May 2023 offered words of reconciliation in the Polish parliament.",
      "\u201cHuman life has equal value, regardless of nationality, race, sex or religion,\u201d Ruslan Stefanchuk told Polish lawmakers at the time. \u201cWith this awareness we will cooperate with you, dear Polish friends, and we will accept the truth regardless of how uncompromising it may be.\u201d",

      "The attack comes a day after the Russian Defense Ministry accused Ukraine of firing multiple Western-made missiles at Russia\u2019s Bryansk region on the border with Ukraine, claiming in an online statement that the attack \u201cwill not go unanswered.\u201d Kyiv has not confirmed the attack.",
      "However, during the almost 3-year war, Russian forces have persistently attacked Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure to plunge the country into darkness and exhaustion during the winter months.",
      "And Wednesday\u2019s attack has further exacerbated the strain on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIt is the middle of the winter, and Russia\u2019s goal remains unchanged: our energy infrastructure.,\u201d said Zelenslyy on Telegram, following the attack.",
      "He urged Western partners to provide Ukraine with additional air defense weapons, emphasizing that \u201cpromises have been made but not yet fully realized.\u201d",

      "Zia is ailing and traveled to London earlier this month for medical treatment after being cleared in another corruption case brought under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted last August in a mass uprising that ended her 15-year rule.",
      "Zia and Hasina are archrivals who have dominated Bangladesh\u2019s politics for decades, and Hasina's ouster has created an opportunity for Zia to make a comeback.",
      "On Wednesday, a five-member Appellate Division of the Supreme Court overturned a 10-year jail sentence handed down by the High Court in 2018 on charges of embezzling some $250,000 in donations meant for an orphanage trust established when Zia became prime minister in 1991.",

      "Wednesday's verdict by the Supreme Court also cleared Rahman and the others.",
      "Zia's lawyers said the verdict means she will be able to contest in next election. Under Bangladesh law, anyone imprisoned for more than two years cannot run for political office for the next five years.",
      "Zia had faced a total of 17 years in prison \u2014 10 years in this case and seven years in the other corruption case. She was acquitted in the other case after Hasina was ousted from office in August.",

She faces charges of mass killing under the interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus. A special tribunal has sought help from international police organization Interpol for Hasina's arrest and requested that India extradite her."

He is wanted for questioning about his Dec. 3 decision to impose martial law on the country.",
      "The National Assembly voided his short-lived declaration just hours after it was announced.",
      "At the time, Yoon claimed he took the action because the liberal opposition, which has a legislative majority, was obstructing his agendas and even the approval of his budget. He described the opposition as North Korea-sympathizing, \u201canti-state forces\u201d responsible for \u201cwreaking havoc and are the main culprits of our nation\u2019s downfall.\u201d",
      "Here is a timeline of events:",

      "The Constitutional Court held its first formal hearing in the case. The session lasted less than five minutes because Yoon refused to attend. The next hearing is set for Jan. 16.",
      "The chief of the presidential security service, Park Jong-joon, resigns.",

      "Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament after Yoon declared martial law, tells lawmakers that he received direct instructions from former defense minister, Kim, to obstruct them from entering the National Assembly\u2019s main chamber. He says Kim\u2019s instructions were to prevent the 300-member Assembly from gathering the 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon\u2019s martial law order.",
      "Kwak says Yoon later called him directly and asked for the troops to \u201cquickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.\u201d Kwak says he did not carry out Yoon\u2019s orders.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Justice Ministry bans Yoon from traveling overseas as police, prosecutors and South Korea\u2019s anti-corruption agency expand competing investigations into allegations of rebellion and other charges in connection with his martial law decree.",

      "Yoon apologizes and says he won\u2019t shirk legal or political responsibility for declaring martial law. He also says he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country\u2019s political turmoil, \u201cincluding matters related to my term in office.\u201d",
      "Yoon survives an impeachment vote that most ruling party lawmakers boycotted, denying the motion that required a two-thirds majority.",
      "In a bombshell reversal, Han Dong-hun, reformist leader of Yoon's party, expresses support for suspending Yoon's constitutional powers, saying that the president poses a \u201csignificant risk of extreme actions, like reattempting to impose martial law, which could potentially put the Republic of Korea and its citizens in great danger.\u201d",

      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that the Office of Defects Investigation opened a preliminary evaluation in October 2023 to determine whether vehicles equipped with an Automated Driving System made and operated by Cruise LLC were using appropriate caution around pedestrians in the roadway after receiving two reports of crashes involving pedestrians. The office also identified two public reports of Cruise ADS-equipped vehicles encroaching on pedestrians in crosswalks.",
      "GM, which bought control of San Francisco-based Cruise automation in 2016, had one incident on October 2, 2023. The crash involved one of its Cruise robotaxis dragging a pedestrian to the side of a San Francisco street. The crash prompted Cruise to suspend driverless operations nationwide after California regulators found that its cars posed a danger to public safety. The state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the license for Cruise, which was transporting passengers without human drivers throughout San Francisco.",
      "The agency said Tuesday that it analyzed 2,759 reports identified by Cruise that involved collisions, including 1,113 that involved a \u201cpedestrian conflict.\u201d Five of those incidents involved a collision between a Cruise and a pedestrian, with three injuries in total.",
      "\u201cIn each of the five pedestrian collision incidents, the Cruise vehicle took avoiding action but was unable to avoid a collision,\u201d according to NHTSA.",
      "Cruise filed a safety recall in November 2023 for a defect in its ADS software.",
      "The NHTSA said that the recall was intended to address safety defects and that Cruise has since ceased business operations and no versions of its ADS are operating on public roads.",
      "The ODI is closing its preliminary evaluation, but the NHTSA said that it reserves the right to take additional action if warranted by new circumstances.",

      "A nonprofit research lab is getting attention from some wealthy tech philanthropists",
      "MONTREAL -- Peeps trickle out of a soundproof chamber as its door opens. Female zebra finches are chattering away inside the microphone-lined box. The laboratory room sounds like a chorus of squeaky toys.",
      "\u201cThey're probably talking about us a little bit,\u201d says McGill University postdoctoral fellow Logan James.",
      "It's unclear, of course, what they are saying. But James believes he is getting closer to deciphering their vocalizations through a partnership with the Earth Species Project. The nonprofit laboratory has drawn some of the technology industry's wealthiest philanthropists \u2014 and they want to see more than just scientific progress. On top of breakthroughs in animal language, they expect improved interspecies understanding will foster greater appreciation for the planet in the face of climate change.",
      "The Earth Species Project hopes to decode other creatures' communications with its pioneering artificial intelligence tools. The goal is not to build a \u201ctranslator that will allow us to speak to other species,\u201d Director of Impact Jane Lawton said. However, she added, \u201crudimentary dictionaries\u201d for other animals are not only possible but could help craft better conservation strategies and reconnect humanity with often forgotten ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWe believe that by reminding people of the beauty, the sophistication, the intelligence that is resident in other species and in nature as a whole, we can start to, kind of, almost repair that relationship,\" Lawton said.",
      "At McGill University, the technology generates specific calls during simulated conversations with live finches that help researchers isolate each unique noise. The computer processes calls in real time and responds with one of its own. Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",

      "Earnings per share rose to $4.81 from $3.04 a year ago. The result beat Wall Street profit projections of $4.09 a share, according to the data firm FactSet. Total managed revenue hit $43.7 billion, up 10%, from $39.9 billion a year ago. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $41.9 billion.",
      "JPMorgan posted a record $54 billion profit for the year, or $18.22 per share, adjusted for one-time expenses.",
      "Yet interest income fell 3% to $23.5 billion, driven lower by lower interest rates.",

      "In September, Wells Fargo agreed to work with U.S. bank regulators to shore up its financial crimes risk management, including internal controls related to suspicious activity and money laundering.

      "CES in Las Vegas provides an annual preview of high-tech attractions headed for the car world",
      "CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, in Las Vegas continues to provide a sneak peek at future technology. The annual showcase includes advanced automotive tech in an industry striving to reduce pollution and increase occupant safety while also providing greater convenience and entertainment for road warriors. These are the most impressive innovations we saw at this year\u2019s event.",
      "What kind of screens and technology can you expect to see in new vehicles in the coming years? BMW\u2019s all-new in-cabin digital interface, dubbed Panoramic iDrive, gives us a compelling preview.",
      "Panoramic iDrive has a digital display at the base of the windshield spanning the entire dashboard. This display is called Panoramic Vision, and it projects everything from speed to EV range to navigation guidance, along with climate and audio info. This display pairs with an easy-to-reach central touchscreen and advanced head-up display that can project 3D-like information on the windshield for the driver. BMW also showcased a new squared-off steering wheel with illuminated buttons that the company says are very easy to use.",
      "We expect Panoramic iDrive will debut in upcoming BMW vehicles in late 2025.",
      "Honda jumped into the deep end of the electric vehicle pool at CES 2025 with the debut of two all-new, all-electric models. The Honda 0 SUV and 0 Saloon are based on two wild-looking concept cars shown at last year\u2019s CES, yet these production-ready models haven\u2019t lost any of their aggressive style and will definitely turn heads when they arrive in 2026.",
      "Both will be built in Ohio and will be capable of Level 3 automated driving functionality, meaning drivers will be allowed to drive hands-free and take their eyes off the road for short periods of time when specific environmental conditions are met. Honda says these 0 models will also use a new technology interface, called Asimo, that will provide a high degree of personalization to customize the driving experience for each user.",
      "The launch of the 0 SUV and 0 Saloon will coincide with Honda\u2019s effort to improve charging access to drivers through a joint effort with seven other automakers. The goal is to have 30,000 high-speed charging stations built in North America by 2030. These stations will have plugs with the Tesla-style North American Charging Standard, or NACS, which most automakers have been switching to.",
      "Even in 2025, getting consistent and stable internet service can be a challenge. We can access the information superhighway through Wi-Fi networks, cellular service or satellite signals, though all three have limitations and are certainly not 100% reliable.",
      "But what if you could combine the power of satellite, cellular and Wi-Fi networks into a single pipeline of internet service? And what if that pipeline could constantly evaluate and optimize the data stream as you travel between signal sources? That\u2019s exactly what Stellar, a new company from France, is offering. The company is working with automakers to optimize mobile service by using hardware already built into today\u2019s cars. The end goal is to have improved, more consistent high-speed internet access in your vehicle, whether you\u2019re going through a city tunnel or driving across the open plains.",
      "Toyota\u2019s vision for the future of mobility goes beyond EVs and self-driving cars. The company is engineering a complete city environment in Japan where everything from building construction to food supply to education and transportation are coordinated for maximum efficiency and minimal environmental impact. The areas of focus include personal transportation, and the company\u2019s massive site, called Woven City, will serve as a test course for automated tech development.",
      "Woven City will scale from an initial 50,000 square miles up to 700,000 square miles as construction continues. By the fall of 2025, it will provide housing for about 360 Toyota staff and family members and eventually expand to 2,000-plus residents, including Woven City partner companies involved in construction, food and drink, education and even rocket production.",
      "While it\u2019s hard to predict what will come out of Toyota\u2019s Woven City that will actually end up in production vehicles, it\u2019s fair to say that Toyota will have a head start on how to leverage various new technologies best.",
      "Full self-driving cars have yet to appear, but automakers are chipping away at this elusive tech while making clear progress in advanced user interfaces, electric vehicle design, and even comprehensive city planning. While the last few years have seen moderate progress in these areas, it feels like we\u2019re on the cusp of multiple breakthroughs in the automotive space.",

That paved the way for an early election on Feb. 23.",
      "Contenders to lead the next government have made contrasting proposals on how to inject new vigor into the economy.",
      "Ruth Brand, the head of the statistics office, ticked off the list of short- and long-term challenges: higher energy prices after the loss of cheap natural gas from Russia; high interest rates from the European Central Bank that deter investment in new machinery and vehicles; and consumers worried about the future who are saving their wages instead of spending them.",
      "Spending on hotels and restaurants sagged by 4.4% and outlays for clothing and shoes fell by 2.8% despite rising disposable income.",

      "Despite the weak growth figures, the jobs market remains strong and disposable income is rising along with pay raises from new wage agreements aimed at making up for inflation.",
      "But a willingness to spend is being held back by worries fed by a range of factors, including a drumbeat of job cut announcements at major companies including Volkswagen, steelmaker and industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp and auto technology supplier Bosch, and by the war in Ukraine.",
      "Brand said that the economy is believed to have shrunk by 0.1% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three-month period. That, however, is a rough initial estimate because hard economic data for December haven't yet been released."

      "The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, was 2.5% in the year to December, largely as a result of easing price pressures in the services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the British economy.",
      "That was down from 2.6% the previous month. Economists had expected no change in the annual rate.",
      "Though inflation has fallen, it remains above the Bank of England's target of 2%.",
      "If the Bank of England decides to cut its main interest rate from 4.75%, it could well ease the pressure in British government bond markets, which have been volatile in recent weeks.",
      "The uptick in the interest rate investors are charging the British government to lend money over 10 years hit a 16-year high in recent days, piling pressure on Treasury chief Rachel Reeves to cut spending or raise taxes in order to allay concerns.",
      "Inflation is way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, central banks have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.",

Such concerns have sent interest rates on Treasury securities higher, which has also pushed up borrowing costs for mortgages, cars, and credit cards, even as the Fed has cut its key rate.",
      "Last Friday's unexpectedly strong jobs report caused stock and bond prices to plunge on fears that a healthy economy could keep inflation elevated, preventing the Fed from cutting its key rate further.",
      "Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, economists forecast that so-called core inflation remained at 3.3% in December for the fourth month in a row.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices likely rose 0.3% in December for the second month in a row. Price increases at that pace would exceed the Fed's 2% target. Core prices are forecast to have risen 0.2%.",
      "Some of the uptick in prices was likely fueled by one-time factors, such as another jump in the cost of eggs, which has been one of the most volatile food categories in recent years. An outbreak of avian flu is decimating many chicken flocks, reducing egg supply.",
      "Economists generally expect inflation to decline a bit in the coming months, as apartment rental prices, wages, and car insurance costs grow more slowly. But clouding the outlook are potentially inflationary policies from President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has proposed to boost tariffs on all imports to the U.S. and to implement mass deportations of unauthorized migrants.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said that he would create the \u201cExternal Revenue Service\u201d to collect tariffs, suggesting he expects many duties to ultimately be imposed, even as he has also said he intends to use them as bargaining chips. During the campaign, he promised to impose up to 20% duties on all imports and as high as 60% tariffs on goods from China.",
      "Last week, minutes from the Fed's December meeting showed that economists at the central bank expect inflation to remain about the same this year as in 2024, pushed up a bit by higher tariffs.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank will keep its key interest rate elevated until inflation is back to 2%. As a result, Wall Street investors expect the Fed to cut its key rate just a single time this year, from its current level of 4.3%, according to futures prices.",
      "Other borrowing costs remain high, in part because of expectations for higher inflation and few Fed rate cuts. Mortgage rates, which are strongly influenced by the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, rose for the fourth straight time last week to 6.9%, far above the pandemic-era lows of below 3%.",
      "With the job market resilient \u2014 the unemployment rate ticked down to a low 4.1% last month \u2014 consumers are able to keep spending and drive growth. If demand exceeds what companies can produce, however, that could fuel further inflation.",
      "Earlier this month, several prominent economists, including former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, agreed that the tariffs Trump will ultimately impose will probably only have minor effects on inflation. The issue was discussed at the American Economic Association's annual meeting in San Francisco.",
      "Jason Furman, a top economic adviser during the Obama administration, said at the conference that the duties may lift the annual inflation rate by just several tenths of a percentage point. But he added that even an increase of that size could be enough to affect the Fed's rate decisions.",
      "\u201cYou are in a world where the Trump policies are more like tenths, than something cataclysmic,\" he said Jan. 4. \"But I think we\u2019re also in a world where the direction of whether rates are staying the same, going down, or going up, depends on those tenths.\u201d"

      "A U.S. watchdog is suing Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts \u2014 and \u201ccheating\u201d customers out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result",
      "NEW YORK -- A U.S. watchdog is suing Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts \u2014 and \u201ccheating\" customers out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result.",
      "In a complaint filed Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took aim at Capital One's promises and handling of its \u201c360 Savings\u201d accounts. Despite promoting 360 Savings as an account that provides one of nation's highest interest rates, the CFPB alleges that Capital One froze its rate at a low level for at least several years, even as rates rose nationally.",
      "At the same time, the CFPB adds, the bank created \u201c360 Performance Savings,\" which saw a much higher rate grow. But the agency says that Capital One did not notify 360 Savings accountholders about this new offering and \u201cinstead worked to keep them in the dark\" \u2014 alleging that the company marketed the products similarly to obscure their distinction and forbade employees \"from proactively telling\u201d those with 360 Savings accounts about 360 Performance Savings.",
      "These actions mean Capital One \u201cillegally avoided paying billions in interest to millions of consumers,\u201d the CFPB wrote in its Tuesday complaint. The agency says it\u2019s seeking to impose civil penalties and provide financial relief to those impacted.",
      "\u201cBanks should not be baiting people with promises they can\u2019t live up to,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a prepared statement.",
      "In response, Capital One said that it strongly disagreed with the CFPB's allegations and plans to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d itself in court. The banking giant added that it was \u201cdeeply disappointed to see the CFPB continue its recent pattern of filing eleventh-hour lawsuits ahead of a change in administration.\u201d",
      "Capital One also maintained that all of its 360 banking products \u201coffer great rates\u201d \u2014 and have \u201calways been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions.\u201d",
      "According to disclosures on the Capital One's website, 360 Savings accounts currently carry an interest rate of just under 0.50%. 360 Performance Savings accounts have an interest rate of about 3.74%.",
      "That means the rate for 360 Performance Savings is nearly 7.5 times higher than that of 360 Savings today. But the CFPB says they've been farther apart in the past. In July 2024, the agency notes in Tuesday's complaint, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times that of 360 Savings.",
      "The CFPB alleges that Capital One kept the rate for its 360 Savings accounts at 0.30% between December 2020 through at least August 2024. The rate for 360 Performance Savings, by contrast, climbed from 0.40% in April 2022 to as high as 4.35% at the start of 2024 \u2014 falling slightly to 4.25% by August, the agency noted Tuesday.",
      "The CFPB's complaint against Capital One comes less than one week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Despite the change in administration, some say this litigation could still survive. Analyst commentary from TD Cowen on Tuesday noted that the CFPB still brought enforcement actions under Trump's first term, for example, although such litigation may also be easier to settle under the incoming administration."

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Spirits giant Brown-Forman Corp. said Tuesday it's reducing its global workforce by about 12% and closing its hometown barrel-making plant in Louisville. The cost-cutting moves come as American whiskey producers face stiff challenges from changing consumer trends and renewed tariff threats.",
      "The actions are projected to produce about $70 million to $80 million in annualized cost savings, a portion of which is expected to be reinvested as part of the company's growth strategy, said Louisville-based Brown-Forman, whose flagship brand is Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey.",
      "The company's cooperage, where barrels are made to store and age its spirits, will close by April 25, affecting about 210 hourly and salaried employees, it said. The closure is part of the overall 12% reduction in the company's 5,400-employee global workforce. Brown-Forman said it will source barrels from an external supplier and expects to receive more than $30 million from selling cooperage assets.",
      "Laid-off workers will receive severance, outplacement services and other benefits, the company said.",
      "Brown-Forman also announced changes in its executive team, including the appointment of Jeremy Shepherd as chief marketing officer. Shepherd previously led its USA & Canada commercial division.",

      "Last month, Brown-Forman reported a 5% decline in net sales for the first six months of its fiscal year compared to the year-ago period. The decline was largely due to its Finlandia and Sonoma\u2011Cutrer divestitures, the company said. Whiting said the results came amid \u201cchallenging economic conditions\u201d but he predicted a stronger performance in the second half of the year. Brown-Forman's many brands also include Woodford Reserve and Old Forester bourbons and Herradura and el Jimador tequilas.",
      "The company's cutbacks come as the overall American whiskey sector faces headwinds that coincide with massive inventories of aging whiskeys that will someday reach the market. In Kentucky, a record 14.3 million barrels of bourbon are aging, the Kentucky Distillers\u2019 Association said last month.",
      "Industrywide challenges include indications that younger adults are drinking less alcohol and the threat of American whiskey getting entangled in another trade war. Meanwhile, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said recently that Americans should be better informed about the link between alcohol and cancer. The risk should be clearly labeled on drinks Americans consume, Murthy proposed.",
      "Republican President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose new tariffs with his return to the White House. During Trump's first term, American whiskey distillers got caught up in a trans-Atlantic trade fight, causing deep drops in exports to the European Union \u2014 the industry\u2019s biggest overseas market. The EU imposed a retaliatory tariff on those spirits in 2018 in response to Trump\u2019s decision to slap tariffs on European steel and aluminum. A 2021 deal suspended those tariffs on American spirits, and U.S. distillers began clawing back lost market share in the EU.",
      "However, the EU is set to reinstate tariffs on American spirits at a 50% rate in March if nothing is done to head it off, the Kentucky Distillers' Association said. Retaliatory tariffs from the EU and other countries have cost Kentucky's bourbon industry a half-billion dollars in exports since 2018, it said. Kentucky and Tennessee, where Jack Daniel's is crafted, overwhelmingly backed Trump in last year's election.",
      "\u201cWe are up against a triple threat of back-breaking tariffs, snowballing taxes and shifts in consumer trends that have slowed sales,\u201d Eric Gregory, president of the distillers\u2019 association, said recently."

      "Spain is planning a raft of measures to address its brewing housing crisis, including an up to 100% tax on properties bought by non-European Union residents",
      "MADRID -- Spain is planning a raft of measures to address its brewing housing crisis, including an up to 100% tax on properties bought by non-European Union residents.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced the plan this week to tackle housing affordability and high rents in the Southern European nation. He said that the overall goal was to provide \u201cmore housing, better regulation and greater aid.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe West faces a decisive challenge: To not become a society divided into two classes, the rich landlords and the poor tenants,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said as he announced the plan.",
      "However, it remains unclear if the plan put forth by S\u00e1nchez\u2019s minority coalition will pass in parliament. Here's a look at what's happening:",
      "Like most rich countries, Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas.",
      "Rental prices have also been driven up by short-term contracts mainly offered for tourists. Spain sees more tourists than almost any country in the world, having received more than 88.5 million visitors in 2024. Tourism is one of the country's key economic drivers.",
      "The negative aspects of mass tourism have caused tension at times between visitors and residents concerned about rising costs, the proliferation of short-term rentals on platforms like Airbnb, and water supplies that can be stretched in some parts of the country, including the Canary and Balearic Islands.",
      "Last year, protesters took to the streets on various occasions across the country to express their frustrations about the growth of tourism and high rents. Barcelona\u2019s town hall has pledged to completely eliminate all short-term rentals to tourists in the coming years.",
      "\u201cWhat citizens expect from us here is action,\u201d Spanish housing minister Isabel Rodr\u00edguez told reporters on Tuesday about the plan.",
      "Spain plans to limit the number of homes foreigners purchase by raising taxes on properties bought by non-European Union residents by up to 100%.",
      "Non-EU residents bought 27,000 properties in Spain in 2023, \u201cnot to live in\u201d but \u201cto make money from,\" S\u00e1nchez said. He didn\u2019t provide a timeline or details on how he plans to implement the tax.",
      "\u201cThis would be massive,\u201d said Sarah Conroy, an English real estate agent who has been working in realty in the upscale Marbella market in southern Spain for over three decades. She didn't give figures on how many non-EU clients she had, but said they included post-Brexit British buyers as well as clients from Saudi Arabia ad Dubai.",
      "\u201cThey need to do something because the people living here can't really rent anything because it is so expensive,\" Conroy said. \"Personally speaking, around 80% of the people I sell to are buying second homes.\u201d",
      "Spain plans to build more public housing and allocate around 2 million square meters (21.5 million square feet) of residential land to a newly created public housing agency.",
      "Other proposed measures include higher taxes on holiday rentals, tax breaks and protections for landlords who provide affordable housing, and amending laws to speed up construction processes and expand the availability of land for private construction.",
      "The rising cost of living has driven voter discontent across many wealthy countries in recent years, including the United States.",
      "But as one of Europe\u2019s leading Socialist politicians, the housing crunch is a crucial question for S\u00e1nchez to resolve as he tries to keep his left-wing minority coalition afloat after winning another four-year term in 2023.",
      "Also, according to the Spanish Constitution, all Spaniards have the right to enjoy a \"decent and adequate\u201d home. In theory, at least, the government has a duty to allow citizens to exercise that right.",

      "Canada\u2019s ambassador to Washington says Canada is prepared to buy more from the United States including its next fleet of submarines to appease President-elect Donald Trump's concerns about the U.S.-Canada trade deficit",
      "PALM DESERT, Calif. -- Canada's ambassador to Washington said Monday that Canada is prepared to buy more from the United States, including its next fleet of submarines, to appease President-elect Donald Trump's concerns about the U.S.-Canada trade deficit.",
      "Ambassador Kirsten Hillman also warned Americans in an interview with The Associated Press that prices will go up for Americans almost immediately if Trump follows through with his plan to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products.",
      "The ambassador also dismissed Trump\u2019s talk of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state, saying that\u2019s how Trump negotiates.",
      "\u201cHe has a negotiating style which involves positioning himself in the best way he can for discussions. I think that is what this is,\u201d Hillman told the AP.",
      "Trump continues to erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \u2014 a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil \u2014 as a subsidy.",
      "Hillman noted Canada buys more from the United States than any other country but is prepared to buy more.",
      "\u201cWe are happy to source what we can from the United States. And we have some big military procurements coming up for example, replacing our entire submarine fleet,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe those are some purchases that can happen from the U.S.\u201d",
      "Hillman said 70% of Canada's military procurement is American sourced. That includes a plan to purchase 88 F-35 fighter jets.",
      "Alberta's Premier Danielle Smith said earlier Monday she favors appeasing Trump by trying to narrow the trade gap, saying the solution is that Canada finds ways to buy more American goods. Smith visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump's home in Florida, over the weekend and spoke to Trump.",
      "Hillman has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. is energy exports.",
      "Hillman said trade with Canada supports over 8 million jobs in the United States and Canada is the number one customer to 36 U.S. states. She said Canada provides a lot of primary materials that go into U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"Adding 25% tariffs to those products will raise the price for Americans almost immediately,\u201d Hillman said. \u201cAnd at a time when the cost of living is challenging, when food prices are high, it seems like the wrong direction to go in.\"",
      "Hillman also reiterated that Canada will retaliate if tariffs are placed on Canadian goods and that will mean a cost for Americans.",
      "\u201cCanada will respond,\" she said. \u201cTherefore your number one customer will make American products more expensive and Canadians will probably look for alternatives to those products.\u201d",
      "Hillman said Canada is not interested in a trade war but said it will be hard for the Canadian government to not respond if the U.S. government makes choices that hurt Canadians.",
      "She said it doesn't make sense for Trump to reverse what he accomplished in his first term when he renegotiated the free trade deal with Canada and Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe are 99% tariff free with the United States, 99% tariff free. And that tariff level is as a result of the USMCA,\u201d Hillman said, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. \u201cThat was negotiated by President Trump. He achieved that success so why would we backtrack from this success that he achieved in his last administration. It just doesn\u2019t make a lot sense.\"",
      "Hillman gave Trump credit for accelerating Canada's plans to increase security at the border. Trump initially threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if the government does not stem what Trump calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the U.S. \u2014 even though far fewer of each crosses into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened.",
      "Canada now has a billion plus border security plan.",
      "\u201cWe have moved really quickly, I\u2019ll be honest, because President Trump focused the mind to put together a full package of improvements,\" Hillman said.",
      "Hillman said also said the U.S. and Canada are in a \u201cgenerational struggle\" with China, a powerful adversary. Trump has been clear about the economic and security threat that Beijing poses, she said. The ambassador said Canada has the energy America needs to drive the artificial intelligence revolution.",
      "\"That is really not possible, based on our experts and American experts, without greater cooperation with Canada through oil and gas, through nuclear, through hydro electricity,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "\u201cIf we are working at odds then frankly China wins. China is trying to drive us apart. That is clear. They look for every opportunity to do so. That\u2019s not good for us, our citizens and Americans.\u201d"

      "Kluetmeier died Tuesday due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease and a stroke, according to his longtime employer, Sports Illustrated. He was considered a pioneer in remote and underwater camera technology.",
      "\u201cBesides his body of work, he left an impression on everybody that he met or worked with,\" said New York City-based photographer Jeff Kavanaugh, who worked alongside Kluetmeier for decades. \u201cIn some ways, that was a great impression. Sometimes it wasn\u2019t. But all in all, it\u2019s just the drive and the determination and just the sheer genius of some of the things that he engineered.",
      "\u201cThe advances that he helped bring along, especially in sports photography, he\u2019ll be remembered for that.\u201d",
      "Kluetmeier was born in Germany in 1942 and moved with his family to Milwaukee at age 9. He was introduced to the idea of a career in photojournalism when pictures of him and his pet parakeet, Chirpy, were published by The Associated Press.",
      "By age 15, he was shooting photos for the AP. Using a Nikon S camera that his parents bought him, he began freelancing for the AP and the Milwaukee Journal.",
      "He once recalled driving to Green Bay while the Packers were in training camp. He walked into the cafeteria at St. Norbert College with a camera around his neck, only to be accosted by coach Vince Lombardi.",
      "\u201cKid, what are you doing here?\u201d Lombardi asked.",
      "Kluetmeier explained that he was assigned to take pictures of Bart Starr, Paul Hornung and Jim Taylor for the AP. Lombardi turned and shouted: \u201cStarr! Taylor! Hornung! Get over here! This kid wants to take some pictures of you guys!\u201d",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my luck,\u201d Kluetmeier said. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine something like that happening today.\u201d",
      "Kluetmeier joined the Journal staff a few years later. In 1969, before he turned 30, Heinz was poached by Time Inc. to work for Life and SI.",
      "He worked countless Olympic Games beginning in 1972 \u2014 his first SI cover featured seven-time gold medalist swimmer Mark Spitz \u2014 as well as Super Bowls, World Series, Kentucky Derbies and Indy 500s. He also photographed President John F. Kennedy on the campaign trail.",
      "His most notable images came from the Olympics, though. His photo of the United States celebrating its victory against Russia in the Lake Placid Games \u2014 shot with a handheld camera from the stands \u2014 is among the most famous sports images of the 20th century. It donned the SI cover without a headline or a caption.",
      "Kluetmeier, who earned an engineering degree, was the first to experiment with an underwater camera during the world swimming championships in Perth, Australia, in 1991 and had mastered the technique by the 2008 Beijing Olympics. His expertise delivered frame-by-frame images that confirmed Phelps edged Milorad Cavic for gold in the 100-meter butterfly.",
      "\u201cIt was pretty dramatic,\" Kavanaugh recalled Wednesday. \"We were fighting for space under there. He just knew that was going to be an iconic moment. And then it turned out it was (Phelps) and Cavic that ended up in Lanes 4 and 5, so we were in perfect position for that. And then it was just kind of little bit of luck hitting the moments.\u201d",
      "Kluetmeier won the Lucy Award for lifetime achievement as a photographer in 2007. He was inducted into the Swimming Hall of Fame in 2017 as a contributor.",

      "JR Motorsports has entered reigning Xfinity Series champion Justin Allgaier into next month's season-opening \u201cGreat American Race\u201d in a Chevrolet sponsored by the whiskey label created by 10-time Grammy winner Chris Stapleton. Traveller Whiskey is a collaborative blend created by Buffalo Trace Distillery with Stapleton.",
      "Allgaier will have to qualify for the Daytona 500 \u2014 a race his boss has won twice \u2014 on either speed in time trials or via one of the qualifying races. It marks the first time in JRM history the team has entered a race in the Cup Series, and Earnhardt said the team will be focused on qualifying via speed powered by a Hendrick Motorsports engine.",
      "The deal came together when Stapleton, who has a friendship with Rick Hendrick, approached Hendrick about a NASCAR collaboration with Traveller Whiskey. Hendrick put Stapleton in touch with Earnhardt as he also has an ownership stake with JRM.",
      "\u201cWe had this whiskey and I always have \u201dpie in the sky\" dreams of things to do and we knocked on the door a little bit,\" Stapleton told The Associated Press. \u201cIf I'm being 100% honest, I just thought it would be cool to see whiskey on a car. And he brought up Dale Jr. and I was like \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t we do that if we can?' This is a lot of my audience, for both whiskey and country music, and what (Earnhardt) does in auto racing.\u201d",
      "The third-party introduction is helping Earnhardt and his sister, Kelley Earnhardt-Miller, attempt to make a dream come true for their race team.",
      "\u201cI shared with Rick that for a very long time that I had a dream, at one time in my life, of entering the Daytona 500 as a car owner,\u201d Earnhardt told AP. \u201cRick presented the opportunity to connect with Chris and his team, they were interested in marketing in our sport, and Rick knew that I was wanting to fulfill this opportunity. It was like two people that wanted the same thing.\u201d",
      "The Earnhardts have led JRM to 88 Xfinity Series victories with drivers Chase Elliott, William Byron, Tyler Reddick and Allgaier last November. JRM is starting its 24th year of overall competition with four cars in NASCAR's second-tier Xfinity Series.",
      "JRM has never attempted to enter a Cup race. The Earnhardts have expressed interest in moving up to Cup competition, but have balked at purchasing the eight-figure charter needed to compete.",
      "Earnhardt said there have been no discussions on future Cup ventures for JRM beyond trying to make the Daytona 500. It will be a high-pressure situation for the Greg Ives-led team as Earnhardt has warned them he and his sister will be hovering from the moment the car is unloaded at Daytona Beach International Speedway through every mile it turns on the track.",
      "Stapleton also plans to attend what will be his first Daytona 500. He and Earnhardt said the musician was intricately involved in the car design, which Stapleton saw in person for the first time Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI'm a bit of a retro guy, I like things that are kind of a throwback,\u201d Stapleton said. \u201cSo I was looking for a little bit of that flavor in the car, but also something that really blended JR Motorsports and Traveller Whiskey. It had to look like both of those things and I think we achieved it.\u201d",
      "Aside from promoting his whiskey, Stapleton is hoping the Daytona 500 turns into a core memory of his accomplished career.",
      "\u201cI wanted to build a thing \u2014 I wanted to see the car and I want to see it run. And that, for me, would be the victory,\u201d Stapleton said. \"And I want the moment of it. It's just like going to the Super Bowl and getting to stay on the sidelines. That's what I want. I want the moment, the moment of the synergy that is happening.",
      "\u201cWhatever comes of it, we still did it.\u201d",
      "Allgaier is the defending Xfinity Series champion and former Cup Series driver who ran the Daytona 500 in 2014 and 2015. His most recent time in a Cup car was last May as the substitute driver for Kyle Larson as Larson attempted to compete in both the Coca-Cola 600 and Indianapolis 500 on the same day.",
      "Allgaier started the Coke 600 for Larson and was credited with a 13th-place finish when the race was called for rain.",
      "\u201cThis is an incredible honor to be driving JR Motorsports\u2019 inaugural entry into the Cup Series,\u201d said Allgaier. \u201cEntering into the Daytona 500 has been a goal of this company for a long time and I know that we are going to have everything we need to go out and contend for the win. This is going to be special for sure.\u201d",

      "The Texas Rangers are making their regional game broadcasts available directly to consumers in a streaming package",
      "The Texas Rangers are making their regional game broadcasts available directly to consumers in a streaming package they say is the first step in providing multiple viewing options after several seasons of access issues.",
      "The MLB team announced Wednesday it entered into a multiyear agreement with A Parent Media Co. Inc. (APMC) to stream Rangers regional games on the Victory+ service starting this year.",
      "That is the same streaming service that took over regional broadcasts for the NHL's Dallas Stars this season. While Stars games and extra content are streamed for free, access for Rangers games will cost $100 for the full season.",
      "\u201cThe Rangers\u2019 partnership with Victory+ as our direct-to-consumer provider is a tremendous first step as the club continues to finalize our television offerings for 2025 game broadcasts,\u201d said COO Neil Leibman, the team's president of business operations. \u201cVictory+ has proven itself over the past few months as a reliable streaming home for several professional sports teams, and we feel Rangers fans will enjoy the familiarity, convenience and simplicity of this service.\u201d",
      "While the team didn't say what the additional options will be, those could include traditional cable and possibly some over-the-air broadcasts. The Rangers, who have more than 16 million households in their broadcast territory over parts of five states, said details about those options would be announced in the coming weeks.",
      "Both the Rangers and Stars previously had their regional broadcasts on Bally Sports Southwest, part of the financially troubled Diamond Sports Group that has gone through a bankruptcy reorganization. The Stars and Diamond mutually agreed last summer to end their existing rights agreement. The Rangers' deal with the group expired at the end of last season.",
      "With Bally Sports Southwest not available through some cable companies and many popular streaming platforms, there were times when fans of the Rangers, Stars and NBA's Dallas Mavericks had issues trying to watch games during a period when all of those teams were having success. The Rangers were World Series champions in 2023, before the Mavericks made it to the NBA Finals last summer and the Stars made it to the NHL Western Conference final.",
      "APMC, which also does broadcasts for the NHL's Anaheim Ducks, announced last month that early metrics for the Victory+ service and live games showed three to four times higher viewership and more than a half million downloads.",
      "The Mavericks this season began a multiyear local broadcast rights agreement with TEGNA that reaches about 10 million people in more than 3.1 million Texas households.",

    "summary": "The Pittsburgh Penguins could be moving on from two-time All-Star goaltender Tristan Jarry",
    "story": [
      "The Pittsburgh Penguins could be moving on from two-time All-Star goaltender Tristan Jarry",
      "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Penguins ran out of patience waiting for two-time All-Star goaltender Tristan Jarry to emerge from a slump, placing him on waivers Wednesday ahead of a pivotal seven-game road trip that could determine the course of the rest of their season.",
      "The 29-year-old Jarry is 8-7-4 with a 3.32 goals against average and a .886 save percentage this season for Pittsburgh, which is on the fringe of the playoff race in the Eastern Conference due in large part to subpar play in net.",
      "The Penguins have allowed an NHL-high 173 goals, with neither Jarry nor Alex Nedeljkovic establishing themselves behind a defense prone to lapses.",
      "The Penguins will call up promising rookie Joel Blomqvist to join Nedeljkovic on the road trip, which starts on Friday in Buffalo. Blomqvist went 3-5 with a 3.60 goals against average and a .904 save percentage during a stint in Pittsburgh earlier in the season.",
      "It seems unlikely a team would be willing to claim Jarry and pick up his salary, meaning Jarry will be reassigned to the Penguins' American Hockey League affiliate in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton once he clears waivers.",
      "\u201cAt this point, (I) just feel it's best in the long run for the team and for Tristan to allow Joel to come up here,\" Pittsburgh general manager Kyle Dubas said Wednesday. \u201cWe think over the past year-and-a-half, with his play in Wilkes-Barre and when he's been up here with us, he's earned the right to have a go at it.\u201d",
      "The decision comes 18 months after Dubas signed Jarry to a five-year deal with an average annual value of $5.375 million. Jarry was an All-Star in 2020 and 2022 but has struggled most of the last two seasons.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s continued to come in here, put the work in and that\u2019s not been a question at all,\u201d Dubas said. \"That just hasn\u2019t materialized the way we would like it to on the ice. At this level, you get to the point where you have to do what\u2019s right ... for him and for us.\u201d",
      "Jarry ceded the starting job to Nedeljkovic last spring. While he reclaimed his spot atop the depth chart coming out of training camp, he stumbled out of the gate and was sent to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton for a lengthy conditioning stint.",
      "While there was a brief uptick in his play after he returned, Jarry has lost five straight starts and continues to struggle early in games. He's allowed a goal on an opponent's first shot six times this season and allowed a shorthanded goal on Seattle's second shot in a 4-2 defeat to the Kraken on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWhen you lose, this is the kind of stuff that can happen,\u201d Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said Wednesday. \"A goaltender already has a ton of pressure, and it\u2019s difficult for us because we feel like as a team we\u2019re responsible if we don\u2019t give our goalies enough help sometimes. I think that\u2019s the tough part.\u201d",
      "Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan, who took his team to task for defensive letdowns in the third period against the Kraken that opened up the door for Seattle's comeback, believes there's a chance Jarry will make his way back at some point.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you make the All-Star team twice if you don\u2019t have a certain level of talent and you\u2019re not capable of making timely saves,\u201d Sullivan said. \"So, I know that Tristan has it. I believe to my core that he\u2019s an NHL goaltender.\u201d",

      "Texas junior quarterback Quinn Ewers has declared for the NFL draft, ending a Longhorns career in which he led the program to a Big 12 championship and twice to the College Football Playoff but was not always embraced by a fan base eagerly waiting for ...",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas junior quarterback Quinn Ewers declared for the NFL draft on Wednesday, ending a Longhorns career in which he led the program to a Big 12 championship and twice to the College Football Playoff but was not always embraced by a fan base eagerly waiting for Arch Manning to take over.",
      "Ewers passed for 9,128 yards and 68 touchdowns in a career that few Texas quarterbacks can match. He had hinted before the season ended that it would be his last in college.",
      "\u201cThese past three years have been some of the best years I could have imagined,\u201d Ewers said in social media post announcing his decision. \u201cThe relationships I've built between coaches and teammates will last forever.\u201d",
      "His 27 career wins rank fourth as a starting quarterback at Texas, and he led the Longhorns to their first Big 12 title in 14 years in 2023 before the program moved to the Southeastern Conference. In their first season in the SEC, the Longhorns rose to their first No. 1 ranking since 2008 and played in the league championship game.",
      "Ewers' biggest legacy will be leading the program to the playoff semifinals in consecutive years, though it fell short of the championship game. He had a fumble on a sack that led to a game-clinching touchdown for Ohio State on Jan. 10 in the Cotton Bowl.",
      "Ewers, who grew up in the Dallas suburbs, was the top-rated high school quarterback in the country when he signed with Ohio State and left school early to the join the Buckeyes for the 2021 season. But after one season spent deep on the Ohio State depth chart, Ewers transferred to Texas, which had just finished 5-7 in coach Steve Sarkisian's first season.",
      "He was the starter by the season opener in 2022 and led the team through seasons of 8-5, 12-2 and 13-3 records. But he was dogged by various shoulder, abdomen and ankle injuries and missed at least two games each season. An abdomen strain this season allowed Manning to start twice and earn the program's first SEC win, which came against Mississippi State.",
      "Ewers' departure sets the stage for Manning to take over in 2025.",
      "The son of Cooper Manning, the grandson of former NFL quarterback Archie Manning and the nephew of Super Bowl-winning QBs Peyton and Eli Manning passed for 939 yards and nine touchdowns and ran for four TDs this season but has seen only limited playing time since September.",
      "Texas fans have been eagerly awaiting his chance to be the full-time starter. Manning will get it with a rebuilt offense.",
      "Top receivers Matthew Golden and Isaiah Bond have declared for the draft and senior tight end Gunnar Helm completed his eligibility. Running back Jaydon Blue, who scored a team-high 14 touchdowns including four in the playoffs, and starting tackles Kelvin Banks Jr. and Cam Williams also left for the NFL.",

I also do understand the tradition and the value in the streak, so we do apologize. But the paint was working tonight.\u201d",

And I\u2019m sure many of you, as well as your members, are feeling a range of emotions as well. This work is so hard, and to know that someone could have not only fooled us, but also law enforcement, is just sickening.\u201d",

      "\u201cBecause we have many checks built into our investigative process, we do not anticipate that we will need to re-open many, if any, cases,\u201d the employee wrote in that email, which was seen by the AP.",
      "The center was established in 2017 to investigate and deliver sanctions in sex-abuse cases involving Olympic sports after scandals involving Larry Nassar and others framed the USOPC and its sports organizations as not up to the task of properly handling those cases.",

      "About six weeks after that arrest came Krasley's arrest on rape, involuntary sexual servitude and other related charges.",
      "\"These charges are far more serious than the last, are despicable if true, and certainly put the Center back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons,\" Colon wrote.",
      "Krasley was released on $750,000 bond shortly after the arrest.",

      "Krasley's lawyer, James Burke, told the AP his client denies the allegations and called it \u201cbizarre\u201d that these arrests were happening nearly a decade after an investigation into the episode had been completed. Burke said Krasley had been a decorated member of the police force before leaving in 2021, shortly after which he started work at the SafeSport center.",
      "None of the allegations surfaced during the SafeSport background check. In the email, Colon said the center was \u201cevaluating our screening and hiring practices.\u201d",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff stretched her unbeaten start to 2025 to seven matches and 14 sets by moving into the third round at the Australian Open with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over 173rd-ranked Jodie Burrage of Britain at Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday.",
      "Gauff, the 2023 U.S. Open champion and a semifinalist at Melbourne Park a year ago, went through a bit of a rough patch in the second set, struggling with double-faults and dropping four games in a row to go from a break up at 3-1 to a break down at 5-3.",
      "But when Burrage served for the second set, Gauff got back in control, using a four-game run of her own to end the contest.",
      "\u201cIt was tough. She was serving really well, so I was just trying to manage that, honestly,\u201d the No. 3-seeded Gauff said. \u201cShe really stepped her level up in the middle of the second set, so I was just trying to be offensive when I could.\u201d",
      "Gauff hit six of her seven double-faults in the second set, but was far steadier at the baseline overall, finishing the 1 1/2-hour match with 11 groundstroke unforced errors, compared to 37 for Burrage.",
      "Each of Burrage's final two service games ended with a double-fault; there were two in a row that made it 6-5.",

      "Being a private person from a small town is why Kim Caldwell keeps her business to herself",
      "Being a private person from a small town, Kim Caldwell keeps her business to herself.",
      "That's why she ducked and dodged questions for months about her first pregnancy.",
      "Then the woman who announced \u201cBaby Caldwell\u201d was on the way with a social media post Sept. 3 realized being the first-year coach of the historic Tennessee Lady Vols' women's basketball program allows her to help other working mothers not stress out or feel alone.",
      "\u201cI have an opportunity here to help the next person that is going to get pregnant during basketball season or anyone that\u2019s going to get pregnant during a time of their life that\u2019s stressful,\" Caldwell told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \u201cAnd for most women, that\u2019s all the time.\u201d",
      "Caldwell also is dealing with plenty of stress herself. The coach who turned 36 in November is due to give birth any day now with the 15th-ranked Lady Vols (14-2) in the meat of the Southeastern Conference schedule.",
      "It doesn't help Caldwell that those two losses came by a combined three points to teams ranked ins the Top 10 at tipoff.",
      "\u201cThose three points haunt me every day,\" Caldwell said. \"They haunt me in practice. They hopefully haunt our players of just how can we get those back? How can we improve? So we\u2019ve tried to tighten things up on them a little bit and learn from these losses.\u201d",
      "Athletic director Danny White went outside the Lady Vols' pipeline when hiring Caldwell last April as the third coach since Pat Summitt retired from the program she built along with barnstorming for women's basketball.",
      "Tennessee has yet to miss the NCAA Tournament that Summitt won eight times, and those banners hang above the court named for her with Summitt's statue across the street from the arena. Neither Holly Warlick nor Kellie Harper, who played for Summitt, could get the Lady Vols back to the Final Four.",
      "Caldwell took Marshall to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1997 last season. She arrived at Tennessee with a 217-31 career record with NCAA Tournament berths \u2014 seven at her alma mater Division II Glenville State where she won the 2022 national championship with two Final Four berths.",
      "Coaching at Tennessee? Not something Caldwell ever imagined.",
      "That's not stopping her from trying to win like she did in her previous stops while getting Tennessee back to where Lady Vols' fans expect.",
      "She's running the same style that worked at Glenville State and Marshall. That makes the Lady Vols tough to scout with their discombobulated, frantic attack up and down the court. Her players had to work hard once she arrived to be in condition ready to run for 40 minutes and more if needed.",
      "That tenacity helped Tennessee rally from 19 down in the third quarter before losing 87-86 to then-No. 9 Oklahoma on Jan. 5. A few days later the Lady Vols were down 18 to LSU before the Tigers had a last-second layup for an 89-87 win.",
      "Before the game, LSU coach Kim Mulkey gave Caldwell a gift bag filled with baby towels, lotion and a onesie following a tradition that the she has been doing since she was at Baylor because women\u2019s basketball needs more women coaching and being parents.",
      "Mulkey credited Summitt's own example as a mentor to her when Mulkey was an assistant coach still at Louisiana Tech. Summitt's son Tyler was born in September 1990.",
      "\u201c(She) basically mentored me and said, \u2018You can do this. Don\u2019t you get out of the business. You can have a baby and you can raise a child and you can be a great coach,\u2019\u201d Mulkey said of Summitt.",
      "The Lady Vols host Mississippi State (15-3) on Thursday night as part of the 13th annual \u201cWe Back Pat\u201d fundraiser in conjunction with the Pat Summitt Foundation and the Southeastern Conference. This game has a personal tie for Caldwell whose grandmother had Alzheimer\u2019s.",
      "Actually being mom and coach is still to come for Caldwell who has worn an oversized shirt, along with her assistants, all season to keep the attention focused on the Lady Vols. Whether Caldwell is having a boy or a girl remains private as well for now.",
      "She told reporters in Knoxville there is a plan in place for the Lady Vols when the baby arrives.",
      "Caldwell said only God knows when she gives birth or how quickly she is able to rejoin the Lady Vols this season. The SEC Tournament starts March 5 with the NCAA Tournament starting March 21 and 22 with Tennessee a possible host for the first weekend.",
      "\u201cGod willing ... I definitely have plans to return sooner than later,\u201d Caldwell said. \"But you just never know what is going to happen. And everyone has a different birth story. And so, again, you\u2019re kind of all prepared for everything.\u201d",

      "Jayden Daniels, meet Slinging Sammy Baugh",
      "Jayden Daniels, meet Slinging Sammy Baugh.",
      "The Commanders' dynamic rookie quarterback accomplished a feat in his playoff debut that no quarterback in the NFL had done since Baugh during the franchise's first season in Washington back in 1937.",
      "Daniels threw two touchdown passes to lead the Commanders to a 23-20 win at Tampa Bay on Sunday night, joining Russell Wilson (2012), Mark Sanchez (2009) and Joe Flacco (2008) as the only rookie quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era to win a road playoff start.",
      "But Daniels did more than just win. He threw for 268 yards and led the team with 38 yards rushing, becoming the first rookie in NFL history to lead his team in yards rushing and passing in a playoff win. He also joined Baugh as the only rookie quarterbacks to throw at least two TD passes in a road playoff win, with Baugh throwing three in the 1937 NFL title game win against the Chicago Bears.",
      "Daniels' 13 wins in the regular season and playoffs are one shy of Ben Roethlisberger's rookie record set in 2004 for Pittsburgh, and he has engineered five fourth-quarter comebacks.",
      "Daniels has been at his best in the clutch, with his 117.3 passer rating when tied or down by eight points or fewer in the fourth quarter or overtime ranking No. 1 among 233 quarterbacks with at least 50 attempts in that situation since 1991.",
      "The Commanders also had their third game this season with Daniels at quarterback when they didn't punt the ball or commit a turnover. That had been done just twice before in the playoffs, with Josh Allen doing it for Buffalo against New England in the 2021 season and Hall of Famer Peyton Manning for Indianapolis against Kansas City in the 2003 season.",
      "The success that coach Dan Quinn has had in his first year as Washington's coach should provide some optimism to the seven teams that are changing coaches this offseason.",
      "Quinn took over a four-win team and guided the Commanders into the divisional round. Instant success like that is not unusual in the NFL, where high draft picks, easier schedules and typical regression to the mean make turnarounds very possible.",
      "Quinn is the ninth coach in the last 10 seasons to reach the divisional round in his first full season with a team, with the 2016 and 2021 seasons the only ones in that span that didn't feature at least one. In 2022, both the New York Giants with Brian Daboll and Jacksonville with Doug Pederson made it to the divisional round with first-year coaches.",
      "Three of those previous eight coaches made it to the conference title game, with Matt LaFleur losing his trip with Green Bay in 2019 and Doug Marrone losing for Jacksonville in 2017.",
      "Gary Kubiak won the Super Bowl in his first season in Denver in 2015, becoming the fourth coach to do that, following Tampa Bay's Jon Gruden (2002), San Francisco's George Seifert (1989) and Baltimore's Don McCafferty (1970).",
      "The AFC divisional round will have an oddly familiar look this season.",
      "For the second time, the four teams in the divisional round in a conference will be making repeat appearances with Kansas City, Buffalo, Baltimore and Houston all returning.",
      "The only difference will be the matchups, with the Chiefs hosting the Texans and Bills hosting the Ravens this year. Baltimore beat Houston in this round last year and Kansas City beat Buffalo.",
      "The only time this happened was in the AFC in 2011-12 when New England, Denver, Baltimore and Houston all made it in back-to-back years, with the Patriots and Ravens advancing both times.",
      "The NFC has only one repeat team in the divisional round, with Detroit back for a second straight season after not making it that far since 1991.",
      "Mike Tomlin and the Pittsburgh Steelers had another disappointing playoff appearance go one and done.",
      "The Steelers lost 28-14 to the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday night for their sixth straight playoff loss, putting Tomlin in some rare coaching company.",
      "Tomlin is tied with Marty Schottenheimer, Jim Mora and Steve Owen for the second-longest postseason losing streak in NFL history, one loss shy of the seven-game skid Marvin Lewis had as Cincinnati's coach.",
      "The games haven't even been competitive most of the way since the streak started with a 36-17 loss to New England in the 2016 AFC title game.",
      "The Steelers have been outscored 73-0 in the first quarter of those losses and haven't had the ball with a lead once in any of those games. The only time they had a lead was in the 2021 wild-card game against Kansas City when T.J. Watt returned a fumble for a TD to open the scoring.",
      "The Chiefs scored a touchdown on the next drive and never trailed again on the way to a 42-21 win.",
      "The skid also includes a wild-card loss at Buffalo last season, a 48-37 loss at home in the 2020 wild-card round to Cleveland and a 45-42 loss at home to Jacksonville in the 2017 divisional round.",
      "Tomlin is the fourth coach since the merger to go at least eight straight seasons with one team without winning a playoff game. Lewis never won a playoff game in 16 seasons with the Bengals, Mora had no playoff wins in 11 seasons with New Orleans and Don Shula went eight straight seasons without a playoff win between Super Bowl appearances in the 1973 and 1982 seasons.",
      "The Houston defense has been causing quarterbacks problems all season.",
      "The Texans held Josh Allen to a 9-for-30 performance in Week 5, intercepted Jared Goff five times in Week 10 and then forced Justin Herbert into one of the worst games he has played.",
      "Herbert threw four interceptions in Saturday's loss to Houston \u2014 surpassing his 17-game regular-season total by one \u2014 for his most in any game in the NFL or college.",
      "The Texans got nine interceptions on 62 passes (14.5%) in the two games against Goff and Herbert while those two QBs threw just 10 on the other 1,013 passes (0.99%) they have thrown this season.",
      "The strong defensive effort sent the Texans to the divisional round for the second straight season with C.J. Stroud at quarterback. Stroud is the sixth QB ever to win playoff starts in each of his first two seasons, joining Brock Purdy, Russell Wilson, Mark Sanchez, Joe Flacco and Ben Roethlisberger.",

      "Pittsburgh Penguins star Evgeni Malkin says his struggling team needs to start playing harder if it wants to return to the playoffs",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Sitting in a quiet dressing room on Tuesday night after another blown lead turned into another crippling loss in a season increasingly filled with them, Evgeni Malkin spoke quietly.",
      "The Pittsburgh Penguins star has long served as the franchise's emotional core, the Russian's passion serving as the yin to longtime captain Sidney Crosby's more reserved yang.",
      "Malkin is well aware his historic partnership with Crosby and Kris Letang is nearing an end. The final chapter is not going the way the longest-tenured trio of teammates in major North American sports planned, particularly for Malkin, whose three Stanley Cup rings were reportedly stolen during a home invasion over the weekend.",
      "So after two periods of dominance against Seattle morphed into a 4-2 defeat to cap a maddening homestand in which the Penguins won just once in five tries \u2014 the lone victory against Connor McDavid and Edmonton \u2014 Malkin shook his head and gave a frank assessment of what is threatening to become another lost season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not good enough,\u201d he said. \"I hope we look in the mirror, tonight and tomorrow and start playing better.\u201d",
      "The All-Star break is a few weeks away, but time already feels like it's starting to run out. The Penguins begin a seven-game, 12-day road trip on Friday in Buffalo on the fringe of the playoff chase in the underwhelming Eastern Conference, the prospect of missing out on the postseason for a third straight year becoming all the more real with every defensive breakdown, every soft goal, every missed opportunity.",
      "\u201cWe see standings,\u201d said Malkin, who had an assist in his return from a four-game absence due to an upper-body injury. \u201cI think we understand we miss playoffs and it\u2019s half-season gone. We understand everything. (If) we want to play playoffs, we need to play so much better, every zone, every moment.\u201d",
      "Yet that kind of consistency has been elusive for most of the season save for a promising stretch between Thanksgiving and Christmas in which Pittsburgh clawed back into contention following a nightmarish opening six weeks.",
      "The optimism, however, has dimmed since the holiday break. Pittsburgh is just 2-5-3 over its last 10 to fall back under .500 after letting Seattle's Jamie Oleksiak and Eeli Tolvanen score 49 seconds apart in the third period to turn a 2-1 deficit into a 3-2 lead.",
      "Both goals highlighted the Penguins' erratic play in the defensive end. Oleksiak came onto the ice on a line change, took the puck at the top of the Pittsburgh zone and skated unchallenged down the slot before beating Tristan Jarry.",
      "Moments later, Tolvanen stood alone in front of the net to tap in a centering pass from Shane White to put the Kraken in front.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating,\u201d defenseman Marcus Pettersson said. \"We\u2019re giving away points. We have nobody to blame but ourselves.\u201d",
      "It's not that the Penguins can't defend. They held Tampa Bay to two shots in the first period on Sunday. They did the same to the Kraken just over 48 hours later. Both times, the opponents skated off with the win after breakdowns at critical times.",
      "\u201cIf I had the answer I\u2019d fix it,\u201d said Mike Sullivan, the NHL's second-longest tenured coach. \"We simply have to do a better job (in our end) and that falls on me.\u201d",
      "Malkin isn't sure he agrees. The Penguins were a playoff fixture during his first 16 seasons in the league and he has raised the Stanley Cup three times. During that era, a certain standard was set. Pittsburgh hasn't lived up to it for quite a while.",
      "\u201cI think everybody understands what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have nice organization. We have great history.\u201d",
      "All NHL dynasties end, though general manager Kyle Dubas said before the season began that he didn't think the Penguins needed to strip the franchise down \u201cto the studs\u201d to rebuild. He has injected some much-needed youth onto the roster, including trading for Philip Tomasino, who scored his fifth goal on Tuesday.",
      "Yet every step forward has been met with a step back. Goaltenders Jarry and Alex Nedeljkovic have shown a propensity to give up early goals. They've allowed opponents to score on their first shot nine times in 46 games, forcing Pittsburgh to play catchup too frequently.",
      "While Crosby in particular remains a marvel \u2014 he's on pace to average a point a game for what would be a record 20th straight season \u2014 the Penguins don't have the firepower that once came so easily. Their margin for error is smaller and they remain one of the league's oldest teams.",
      "Spending the next two weeks crisscrossing North America could give them a chance to steal away and hit the reset button. Or it could drop them into a hole so deep they could be essentially out of it by Groundhog Day. It could go either way. No one knows that more than Malkin.",
      "\u201cWe need to play so much harder,\u201d Malkin said.",
      "And do it quickly.",

      "He's insisting there should be far bigger concerns.",
      "Woods said Tuesday night \u2014 after his debut in the TGL indoor golf league that he helped develop \u2014 that meetings about what will happen with the tournament are scheduled, but did not reveal any decisions or suggest that the event may be moved from Riviera Country Club.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to just figure everything out and make sure that everyone is safe and we have meetings scheduled going forward,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBut as of right now, we\u2019re not really focused on the tournament. It\u2019s more about what we can do to help everyone who\u2019s struggling, who\u2019s lost homes and had their lives changed.\u201d",
      "Woods \u2014 who grew up in Southern California \u2014 said he knows \u201ca couple people that have lost everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's just hard,\u201d Woods said.",
      "The PGA Tour has not announced any changes to its plans to play the Genesis, scheduled for Feb. 13-16. Riviera \u2014 the host site for golf at the 2028 Olympics \u2014 sits very close to areas that have been devastated by the fires. The course itself has not been directly affected.",
      "Woods' TGL teammate Max Homa \u2014 also a Southern California native \u2014 said the golf tournament's status should be far from anyone's mind right now.",
      "\u201cI know that these natural disasters happen far too often. However, this was the first one I can remember where every news clip, every time someone mentioned an area, I could picture it so well,\u201d Homa said. \u201cIt was very eerie. Fortunately, all my friends and family are safe. Houses not necessarily still all intact, but it was nice to be able to talk to quite a few people, and I think their perspective has been amazing about, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re safe, and that\u2019s what matters most.\u2019\u201d",
      "Tickets were still being sold Tuesday for the Genesis, though nobody knows what will happen over the next few weeks \u2014 or if it'll even be possible to play a tournament in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many other things that are bigger than that,\" Woods said. \u201cWe have subsequent meetings to try and figure all that out.\u201d",
      "Woods' Jupiter Links team lost 12-1 in its TGL opener to the Los Angeles Golf Club, and Collin Morikawa \u2014 part of the winning side Tuesday \u2014 said representing the city weighed heavily on him and teammates Justin Rose and Sahith Theegala.",
      "Fires burning homes and businesses in Los Angeles for a week have killed at least 25 people, displaced thousands and destroyed more than 12,000 buildings in what might be the most expensive set of conflagrations in the nation\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cYou think it's over, but it's not,\u201d Morikawa said. \u201cWinds are picking up. Fires are still going. People are still out there, fighting the fires, protecting their houses, helping their neighbors, helping communities. That's why LA is, to me, such a great city. You see all the people coming together.\u201d",
      "Morikawa wore the \u201cLA Strong\u201d T-shirt that is being sold to raise money for fire relief efforts. Theegala, like Morikawa, has deep Southern California ties \u2014 he was born and raised in the area and went to college at Pepperdine. He said his caddie's sister lost her home in the fires.",
      "\u201cI was on Pepperdine\u2019s campus during the \u201918 Woolsey fire, and it just feels like an ongoing thing the last six, seven years. There\u2019s no slowing down,\u201d Theegala said. \u201cBefore that first fire happened, it didn\u2019t feel real at all. You see fires happening, houses being burned down, people\u2019s lives being destroyed, and when you see it right in front of your eyes, it\u2019s as real as it gets and it\u2019s scarier than any media portrayal. It\u2019s scarier than anything that\u2019s being described.\u201d",
      "Morikawa said he took pride in being able to give people in Los Angeles a distraction for a couple hours, like the Los Angeles Rams did in their NFC wild-card playoff win on Monday night \u2014 a game that was relocated to Arizona because of the fires.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re probably the newest team in LA, but to get back-to-back wins with the Rams and then us ... you laugh at that, I know,\u201d Morikawa said. \u201cBut look, we don\u2019t take this lightly.\u201d",

      "Tiger Woods was the sixth and final player to emerge from the tunnel and onto the field of play for his TGL debut",
      "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- Tiger Woods was the sixth and final player to emerge from the tunnel and onto the field of play for his TGL debut on Tuesday night.",
      "No one announced his name. Wasn't necessary.",
      "Survivor's \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d blared and that was more than enough of an introduction for perhaps golf's greatest player ever. It's not like anyone inside SoFi Center at Palm Beach State College didn't know who Woods was, and most were even probably aware of how he, Rory McIlroy and others spent years trying to make this notion of indoor golf on TV happen.",
      "\u201cIt is a reality now,\u201d Woods said.",
      "Week 2 of TGL was Tuesday night \u2014 Woods joined Kevin Kisner and Max Homa of Jupiter Links Golf Club to take on the Los Angeles Golf Club of Justin Rose, Collin Morikawa and Sahith Theegala.",
      "The final score: Los Angeles 12, Jupiter 1 in the 15-hole, made-for-TV team match featuring nine holes of alternate shot triples play, followed by six holes of singles play \u2014 two holes for each player on each team. Woods was smiling throughout, even with the lopsided score. The format is such that he only took 20 shots over the course of the match, which lasted just over two hours.",
      "\u201cWe were entertaining,\" Woods said, still laughing even after the rout ended inside the arena built just a few miles from his Jupiter Island home. \u201cWe hit a lot of shots. I think the people there got to see how bad pros can be. It was just a boat race, oh my goodness. But we had a great time.\u201d",
      "Woods' team got on the wrong side of the scoreboard quickly, falling behind 5-0. It could have been worse if Woods hadn't made an 8-footer for par to help his team get a tie on the fifth hole. That putt came one hole after Woods slid a 7-footer wide to the left.",
      "\u201cIt's about time, Tiger,\u201d tennis legend Serena Williams said on the ESPN broadcast. Williams is a longtime friend of Woods, so she found herself rooting for him \u2014 and she is part of the ownership group of the Los Angeles Golf Club, so she found herself simultaneously rooting against him.",
      "There were vintage Woods moments, like staring down shots he liked as the super-high-tech video boards told the tale of where the ball would have gone outdoors. There were also frustrating ones; he shook his head after he sent a 101-yard wedge into the water on the second hole of the 15-hole match \u2014 as son Charlie, sitting in one of the seats in the arena overlooking the course, couldn't help but laugh.",
      "\u201cThis is unique. This is something that golf has never seen before,\" Woods said. \u201cYou have an arena like this and you out there with great guys, entertain everyone, just have fun.\"",
      "It wasn't just Charlie Woods chuckling at Jupiter Links' play. Tiger Woods was as well \u2014 especially when Kisner bladed a shot from the sand, sent it ricocheting off the pin as his teammates ducked for cover.",
      "\u201cWe honestly didn't think that anyone could possibly get hit in here,\u201d Woods said.",
      "The golf might be a hit. Woods was hoping viewers watched until the end; Homa suggested that Duke fans would still be watching, since the Blue Devils were playing Miami on ESPN after the golf ended. And Woods, who walked with his son in a tournament last month, looked like he was physically sound \u2014 at least in the sense that he didn't seem to be holding anything back while swinging.",
      "Physically, he said he felt fine. As far as the golf: \u201cThe walking's not the issue. My game's not any good,\" Woods said.",
      "Williams sat in the Los Angeles box just to the right of the players' teeing areas, enjoying the spectacle of the walk-out introductions, light and smoke shows and booming music.",
      "\u201cIt's so wild,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt's something that you see a little bit in tennis. We see it all the time in basketball, right? We don't really see it so much in golf. Actually, we never see that in golf. It's so good to kind of see their personalities and see them shine as golfers. ... It's so cool to see a new aspect.\u201d",

      "Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes spent Sunday watching some wild-card playoff games while waiting for his wife, Brittany, to give birth to their third child",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Patrick Mahomes had his mind on the playoffs even as he was awaiting the arrival of his third child.",
      "The Chiefs quarterback said Tuesday that his wife, Brittany, let him watch some of the wild-card games Sunday while they were waiting for her to give birth. She wound up delivering their second daughter, which they named Golden Raye, to go along with 3-year-old daughter Sterling and a 2-year-old son that they nicknamed Bronze.",
      "\u201cBrittany crushed it,\u201d Mahomes said before heading out to practice for Saturday's divisional-round matchup against Houston, which blew out the Chargers in the wild-card round. \"It's been cool to welcome another baby girl to the family and see how my other kids reacted to her, and have a baby sister and stuff like that. So it's been a lot of fun.",
      "\u201cAnd,\u201d Mahomes added, \u201cit was cool that football was on TV while I was in the hospital, so I was able to watch a little bit.\u201d",
      "Mahomes, a self-described football junkie, was happy the schedule worked out for him. The Chiefs clinched the No. 1 seed and a first-round bye before their Week 18 game in Denver, which Mahomes sat out with many of their best players. And that meant he was able to focus on the arrival of his child rather than worrying about a first-round playoff opponent.",
      "Asked whether baby No. 3 was easier than the first two, Mahomes offered a wise husband-turned-father reply: \u201cI don't even want to say that because, like, Brittany's doing everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was cool that we got the bye, just because you can kind of really focus in on just being at the hospital, being in the moment,\u201d he added. \u201cIt's a special moment that a lot of dads and moms experience. And you don't forget that stuff.\u201d",
      "Now, the two-time NFL MVP can focus on making some more memories. The Chiefs are trying to become the first team to win three consecutive Lombardi Trophies. They were early 8 1/2-point favorites to beat the Texans, according to the BetMGM Sportsbook, and have the second-best odds to win the Super Bowl behind Detroit, the top seed in the NFC.",
      "\u201cI think every year is special,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cObviously you want to win three in a row and build those memories with the guys and the community. But every single year is special. And when I look back at all the different Super Bowls that we've won, I look back at special moments that we've had and special games that we've had. And so, we'll try to do the same this year.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs beat the Texans the weekend before Christmas, part of a grueling stretch in which both played three times over 11 days. And they've won four in a row over Houston dating to the 2020 playoffs, when they fell behind 24-0 in a divisional-round game at Arrowhead Stadium but rallied for a 51-31 victory \u2014 and went on to win Mahomes' first Super Bowl.",
      "Chiefs coach Andy Reid said the bye week \u2014 and really, more than three weeks off for the most consequential players who sat out the game in Denver \u2014 has left his team as healthy as it's been all season heading into their playoff opener.",
      "\u201cThey've got good attitudes,\" Reid said. \u201dThey were in last week and did a nice job with that. Even on the days off, a lot of them came in. But they're excited. They know they're playing a good football team.\"",
      "NOTES: CB Jaylen Watson (broken ankle) could play Saturday for the first time since getting hurt Oct. 20 against San Francisco. \u201cNot telling you he could play a whole game,\u201d Reid cautioned, \u201cbut I think he has a chance to play for sure.\u201d ... The Chiefs plan to rotate Joe Thuney and D.J. Humphries in practice before deciding on a starter at left tackle. Thuney slid out from guard late in the season with Mike Caliendo replacing him as the Chiefs tried to better protect Mahomes' blind side. But that was while Humphries was dealing with a hamstring injury, and he will be healthy for Saturday. \u201cI'm going to see how it goes this week,\u201d Reid said.",

      "HONOLULU -- Gary Woodland had a brief vacation with wife Gabby on the Big Island before coming over to Oahu for the Sony Open. Never was a 45-minute flight more memorable.",
      "They were in the second row on the Hawaiian Airlines flight. The final passengers to board were in the first row \u2014 former President Barrack Obama, his wife and two daughters.",
      "\u201cThat one surprised me,\" Woodland said. \u201cI was surprised he was on a commercial flight.\u201d",
      "Woodland thought it was strange when they boarded the flight and were told their overhead luggage needed to be stored toward the back of the plane, not in first class. Before long, he said five or six federal agents boarded the plane.",
      "\u201cI knew President Obama was playing golf at the same place I was, so I knew he was in town,\u201d Woodland said. \u201cThen I saw the Secret Service and I had an inkling. When they told us to put our luggage in the back, I had never seen that before in first class.\u201d",
      "Woodland said the flight was full, but the Obama family was the last to board and \u201cI don't even think people knew he was on the plane.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a cool experience,\u201d Woodland said. \u201cThere was no talking. I would have loved to have talked to him, but I didn't want to bother him, either. Just to see the whole operation \u2014 how they did it, when we landed, five or six more Secret Service \u2014 it was cool.\u201d",
      "Obama loves golf and sports. Unclear is whether the former president recognized the 2019 U.S. Open champion at Pebble Beach. Woodland said he and his wife were asked to deplane first.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Thank you for your service\u2019 when I got off the plane,\u201d Woodland said. \u201cI don't know if he recognized me or not. I know people who know him and they say he's a massive sports nut and a golf fan. He gave me a thumbs-up when I got off the plane.\u201d",
      "One match into the inaugural TMRW Golf League season, the hi-tech indoor circuit already has prompted suggestions for the PGA Tour. Matt Fitzpatrick and Rickie Fowler said as much when they answered simultaneously after their New York club won the opener.",
      "\u201cShot clock.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was my favorite part of TGL,\u201d Webb Simpson said.",
      "Is it possible? Enough that it will probably get some consideration when the PGA Tour puts together a working group of players for yet another look at pace of play under Commissioner Jay Monahan's \u201cEverything is on the table\u201d message at the end of last year.",
      "It has been done in professional golf. The Shot Clock Masters debuted on the European tour in 2018 at what previously was the Austrian Open. The tournament had a lapse in sponsorship, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived and it became one-and-done. Four penalties were handed out, mainly because players said they forgot about the clock.",
      "Is it practical? There would be significant expense involved in adding more rules officials, or spending a lot of time training volunteers operating what could be as many as 54 clocks on 18 holes (tee, fairway, green).",
      "\u201cI think people would be in favor of it, but it would be an adjustment,\u201d Sony Open winner Nick Taylor said. \u201cCertain shots are not equal, like in a playoff or a putt to make the cut \u2014 now that would be interesting. But it would speed things up, no doubt.\u201d",
      "TGL is helped by already having an indoor arena with a lot of lights, including the shot clock. One idea is to have a green, yellow and red light on tour to keep spectators from counting down to zero, while still letting players know time is running out.",
      "Simpson mentioned two allowable bad times per round. He also said while fines don't work, perhaps cumulative fines for taking too long will get players' attention.",
      "\u201cI would be so for it,\" he said. \"Me and some players talked about it a few days ago. It would be an investment on the PGA Tour. You have to get trained people. We'd have to iron out the kinks, like rulings. But I think you could do it.\u201d",
      "Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley was two shots out of the lead going into the final round of the Sony Open, got off to a slower start than he wanted and tied for sixth, three shots out of a playoff. It was his third top 10 in his last five starts dating to his BMW Championship victory.",
      "Bradley now is No. 11 in the world, making him the sixth-ranked American.",
      "So much of the attention is on whether he will play his way on his Ryder Cup team. That\u2019s a bridge to cross this summer. Bradley is trying to play good golf for other reasons.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m on a mission to be the best player that I can be, one of the best players in the world,\u201d he said.",
      "He hasn\u2019t won a major since his rookie year in 2011, and he hasn\u2019t challenged in a major since the U.S. Open at Brookline in 2022. That tops his list of priorities. Right behind is winning on the PGA Tour, which he has done each of the last three years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to make that four years in a row,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I really want to be looked at as one of the best players in the world. Me being the Ryder Cup captain doesn\u2019t have anything to do with that. I still feel like I\u2019m in the prime of my career, playing the best golf I\u2019ve ever played, and I want to keep building on that.\u201d",
      "Jesper Svensson of Sweden made the best first impression among the 10 European tour players who earned PGA Tour cards this year. He played the back nine in 30 at the Sony Open and tied for 10th.",
      "How he made it to Hawaii is still hard for him to believe.",
      "\u201cTwo years ago, I didn\u2019t even have a category on the Challenge Tour,\u201d Svensson said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy journey.\u201d",
      "Svensson, who won the Big South Conference title twice at Campbell University in North Carolina, lost his card in 2022 and was playing in the Nordic Golf League when he received an exemption to the B-NL Challenge Trophy in the Netherlands and shot 66 the last day to win.",
      "That led to a European tour card, and he won the Singapore Classic. He effectively clinched a PGA Tour card with his tie for seventh in the DP World Tour Championship.",
      "The only other player from the 10 European tour members to play the Sony Open was Rikuya Hoshino, who missed the cut. Matteo Manassero and Antoine Rozner will join them in The American Express.",
      "Golf Digest Middle East reported that Tom McKibbin of Northern Ireland, who got the last card, is on the verge of joining LIV. Because the PGA Tour season has started, if he goes to LIV then a card would not go to Jordan Smith, who finished 11th in the European tour category.",
      "Lucas Glover hit a bunker shot in the third round of the Sony Open that brought a strange experience. There was a dead baby sea turtle, about the size of a casino chip, next to his ball. He played the shot without touching it. \u201cI thought I was going to make it,\u201d Glover said. \u201cAre they good luck?\u201d He did manage to get up and down. ... Florida State junior Luke Clanton now has as many runner-up finishes as missed cuts (2) on the PGA Tour in his nine tournaments since June. ...

      "It was quite a debut in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament for the 18-year-old Brazilian, who is currently ranked 112th and made it into the bracket at Melbourne Park by winning three matches in qualifying rounds last week.",
      "The victory over 10-time major quarterfinalist Rublev, who is 27, lasted just under 2 1/2 hours and stretched Fonseca's current unbeaten run to 14 matches. That includes taking the title last month in Saudi Arabia at the Next Gen ATP Finals for top players who are under 21, and another trophy this month at a lower-tier Challenger tournament in Canberra.",
      "Those within tennis have been keeping tabs on 2023 U.S. Open junior boys' champion Fonseca for a bit, intrigued by his big serve, booming groundstrokes and cool demeanor. All of those qualities, and more, were on display against Rublev in Margaret Court Arena, the second-biggest stage in Melbourne.",
      "Fonseca got to match point with a backhand winner that he celebrated by raising his right index finger in a No. 1 gesture and nodding his head. Then he ended it with a down-the-line forehand, spreading his arms wide and tossing his head back.",
      "\u201cI mean, not bad,\u201d were Fonseca's first words during his on-court interview afterward.",
      "That drew a smile from him and supportive laughter from the stands, where there were plenty of fans sporting his home country's green-yellow-and-blue flag.",

      "Hitting serves at up to 133 mph (214 kph), Fonseca delivered 14 aces and had just one double-fault while saving five of the six break points he faced.",
      "He accumulated 51 total winners, 18 more than Rublev, a quarterfinalist in Melbourne three of the past four years and Fonseca's first opponent ranked higher than No. 20.",
      "\u201cI was just focusing (on) my game, trying to put no pressure on myself, playing (against) a top-10 guy,\u201d Fonseca said. \u201cI was just playing my game and, well, now we're in the second round.\u201d",

The Monnaie de Paris will replace all damaged medals at the athletes\u2019 request during the first quarter of 2025.\u201d",
      "Parisian jewelry house Chaumet designed the medals, which were part of the Games\u2019 lasting legacy. A hexagonal, polished chunk of iron taken from the iconic Eiffel Tower was embedded in each gold, silver and bronze medal.",
      "But concerns about their quality emerged before the Games had even ended last summer when American skateboarder Nyjah Huston posted a video showing how quickly his bronze medal had deteriorated. Many other athletes have since also complained. French swimmers Yohann Ndoye-Brouard and Cl\u00e9ment Secchi recently posted images of their medals on social media, describing them as looking like \u201ccrocodile skin,\u201d or dating back to 1924.",
      "The IOC told the AP that Paris organizers are in contact with the national Olympic committees of the athletes concerned. It confirmed that the replacement process will start in the coming weeks, and that the French mint is working with Paris organizers to understand the circumstances and cause of any damage.",
      "\u201cDamaged medals will be systematically replaced by the Monnaie de Paris and engraved in an identical way to the originals,\u201d the IOC said.",
      "The iron pieces embedded in the center of the Olympic medals each weigh 18 grams (about two-thirds of an ounce).",
      "They were cut from girders and other bits that were swapped out of the Eiffel Tower during renovations and stored for safekeeping, according to Joachim Roncin, head of design at the Paris Games organizing committee.",

      "Daniil Medvedev has used his racket to smash a tiny camera attached to the net at the Australian Open while he was trailing in his first-round match in the main stadium",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Daniil Medvedev used his racket to smash a tiny camera attached to the net at the Australian Open while he was trailing someone ranked 418th before eventually avoiding a monumental upset and winning 6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 in the first round at Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday.",
      "The No. 5-seeded Medvedev earned the title at the 2021 U.S. Open and is a three-time runner-up at Melbourne Park, including a year ago, but was hardly playing his best in the second and third sets against Kasidit Samrej, a wild-card entry from Thailand who was making his Grand Slam debut.",
      "\u201cI know I play better when I play more tennis,\u201d Medvedev joked afterward. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Why play 1 hour, 30 (minutes)?\u2019 Need a minimum of three hours, at least, to feel my shots better.\u201d",
      "The camera-destroying racket swings happened in what would be the last game of the third set, which Samrej claimed to take a two-sets-to-one-lead in the best-of-five match.",
      "Medvedev's display of anger came after he lost a 13-stroke point to trail 40-15. Samrej hit a shot that clipped the net, altering its trajectory and throwing off the Russian's balance, before a cross-court forehand passing winner left Medvedev unable to make contact.",
      "Medvedev went up to the net and brought his racket forward with full force five times, breaking his equipment while shattering a small black camera and sending pieces of it flying. That earned a code violation warning for racket abuse from the chair umpire.",
      "Soon enough, Medvedev had dropped the set, leaving him with plenty of work to do to avoid a massive upset in his first match of the 2025 season. Medvedev quickly did turn things around, though, claiming 12 of the remaining 15 games, and 61 of the remaining 94 points.",
      "He finished with 24 aces and fewer than half as many unforced errors as Samrej, 34 to 69.",
      "\u201cIn the end of last year, this match, I probably would have lost it,\u201d said Medvedev, who went 3-1 in five-setters at the 2024 Australian Open. \u201cNew year, new energy.\u201d",
      "Samrej got treatment from a trainer because of a problem with his left leg late in the fourth set.",
      "He was trying to become the lowest-ranked man to eliminate one of the top five seeded players at a Grand Slam tournament since the ATP's computerized rankings began in 1973, according to the International Tennis Federation.",
      "The biggest such result entering Tuesday was when No. 234 Alex Kim beat No. 4 Yevgeny Kafelnikov at the 2002 Australian Open.",
      "Samrej earned his way into this year's Australian Open bracket by going through four rounds of a wild-card playoff for the Asia-Pacific region in November. He never had played against someone ranked higher than 78th until Tuesday and never has beaten anyone ranked higher than 157th.",
      "\u201cI watched his matches, and I didn't see this level, so I was surprised,\u201d Medvedev said. \u201cIf he plays like this every match, his life will be good.\u201d",

      "The players were chosen from among the thousands of Ukrainians wounded in the war",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The players were chosen from among the thousands of Ukrainians wounded in the war. With limbs lost to Russian attacks, they gathered at a stadium in Kyiv over the weekend, ready to embark on a new contest: a soccer tournament.",
      "Organized by Ukraine\u2019s Association of Football, the \u201cLeague of the Mighty\u201d is Ukraine\u2019s first soccer championship for amputees. Over the past year, the association has invested in local communities to establish teams, recognizing the growing number of war-wounded citizens as a result of the nearly three-year war.",
      "With six outfield players and one goalkeeper on each side, they engaged in intense matches. Outfield players, all lower-limb amputees, and goalkeepers with upper-limb amputations, played without prostheses, relying on wrist clutches for control.",
      "Pokrova AMP won the tournament, with captain Valentyn Osovskyi describing the triumph as exhilarating. \u201cWe're really glad that we had to work our way through, it was interesting,\u201d he said, adding that the goal is to have their own championship and to create a strong team to represent Ukraine on the international level.",
      "\u201cThis will be a priority for the next few years for us,\u201d said Andriy Shevhenko, president of the Ukrainian Association of Football, noting there are more than 100,000 amputees in the country, most of them \u201csoldiers who defended our country.\u201d",
      "For Olena Balbek, adviser to the president of the association, the sport is one way to provide mental and physical rehabilitation for amputees while also normalizing their growing presence in society.",
      "\u201cThis is a societal effort,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on sports because it\u2019s our area of expertise, to make sure this is normalized.\u201d",
      "Citing their own research, Balbek said the association boasts at least 60 professional amputee players in Ukraine \u2013 a significant number considering there are around 1,000 worldwide.",
      "Though the reasons are unfortunate, Balbek said, \u201cWe have a huge potential in terms of engaging people in the sport.\u201d",
      "Featuring five teams from across Ukraine, the weekend\u2019s championship served as a testament to the association\u2019s success in developing grassroots amputee football across the country since the full-scale invasion began. A dedicated department within the association assists local groups in creating teams.",
      "The work is multifaceted, said Balbek, involving communication with veteran\u2019s groups, local initiatives and football clubs underscoring the importance of establishing amputee teams.",
      "\u201cFootball is the best rehabilitation for me,\" said Mykola Gatala, captain of the Pokrova AMP-One team. \"It has helped me both physically and mentally. I\u2019m doing it with my brothers in arms who went through the same things I did. We understand each other.\u201d",

      "They lead the NBA in wins so far in January",
      "They lead the NBA in wins so far in January. They'll have a winning record at the midpoint of the season. They've won five of their last six games at home, and they've also won five of their last six games on the road.",
      "And chances are, you wouldn't guess which team fits that billing.",
      "It's the Detroit Pistons. Yes, the Pistons.",
      "Doormats and punchlines no more, the Pistons are adding themselves to the list of great surprises in the NBA this season. They're now 21-19 after winning Monday night against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden, meaning they'll hit the halfway mark of the season with a winning record for the first time since 2017-18.",
      "\u201cWe believe we can beat anybody,\u201d Pistons center Isaiah Stewart said. \u201cThat's our belief. We're good enough to beat any team in this league. That's the belief we've got and we believe in each other. We're always pouring confidence into each other to go out there and be the best versions of ourselves. When we have that collectively as a group, that's a lot of energy \u2014 a lot of positive energy that we're putting out there.\u201d",
      "The notion of the Pistons beating anybody \u2014 literally, anybody \u2014 a year ago would have been comical. That was the team that lost a record 28 consecutive games, the worst single-season stretch in NBA history. They were 4-37 through 41 games, tying the sixth-worst start to a season ever. They were so bad that Pistons owner Tom Gores had to do the unthinkable and fire a coach in Monty Williams with five years and $65 million or so left on his contract.",
      "This year's Pistons started 0-4 under new coach JB Bickerstaff. The preseason expectations of being bad once again looked pretty secure. But they've now won 10 of their last 12 games and lead the NBA with seven wins so far in January. They could be a play-in team. They could be a playoff team. They might have an All-Star in Cade Cunningham. The way he's playing right now, Cunningham \u2014 bidding to be Detroit's first All-Star since Blake Griffin in 2019 \u2014 might want to go ahead and make plans for a trip to San Francisco next month for that very reason.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thankful for my team, thankful for this coaching staff,\" Cunningham said. \"We've got to keep going. We've got a lot more work to do.\u201d",
      "The Pistons have already smashed last season's win total of 14. They're maybe a couple weeks away from rewarding bettors that went on the high side of their season-long win total that was set at 25.5 by BetMGM Sportsbook. It's happening with Cunningham \u2014 the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 draft \u2014 now looking like a bona fide breakout star, with season averages of 24.5 points, 9.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds per game.",
      "\u201cOur job is to put him in position to be successful. And then he\u2019s got to go out there and do it,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cOver these 40 games now, he and I and his teammates have learned a lot about each other and how we can best help each other. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s about \u2014 each of us playing our role and doing what we\u2019re supposed to do together and collectively to just help one another, make this team as good as we possibly can. Cade knows his role and what this team needs, and he\u2019s executed perfectly.\u201d",
      "It does seem fitting that Bickerstaff is getting to be part of something good, since he was fired by a good team in Cleveland after last season. The Cavaliers had an over-under of 48.5 wins entering the season; they're an NBA-best 33-5 right now.",
      "Oklahoma City, Houston, Chicago, Portland, Brooklyn and Atlanta are also among the teams on pace to top their expected win totals for the season. But they won't get there in January, like the Pistons might. If that's the metric for measuring surprises, then the Pistons might be the biggest stunner so far this season.",
      "\u201cThe best part about this team is finding different ways to win the game,\u201d Bickerstaff said.",
      "It's been a long time coming. It's not time to start selling playoff tickets quite yet, Detroit. But before now, the last time the Pistons were even two games over .500 \u2014 barely above mediocre \u2014 was March 2019, nearly six years ago.",
      "These are good signs. Signs of progress. Signs of belief. For a franchise that hasn't won a playoff game in 17 years \u2014 that's 173 players, 10 coaches and two arenas ago \u2014 there might be real hope this time.",

      "DENVER -- The Denver Broncos and the Los Angeles Chargers felt good about their chances heading into the playoffs in large part because they had played the reigning two-time Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs so tough this season.",
      "Their wipeouts in the wild-card round show they're not as close to overtaking the Chiefs as they may have thought.",
      "The Broncos (10-8) would have swept Kansas City (15-2) were it not for a blocked field goal as time expired in Week 10 that preserved the Chiefs' 16-14 escape at Arrowhead, and Denver ended its eight-year playoff drought with a 38-0 shutout of K.C.'s backups in Week 18.",
      "If not for that fluke failure from his field goal protection unit, Sean Payton would be 3-1 against Kansas City since becoming Broncos head coach, and Jim Harbaugh was really close to going 2-0 against Andy Reid this season.",
      "The Chargers (11-7) lost by two and seven points to K.C., which won its ninth consecutive AFC West crown in its quest for an unprecedented three-peat as Super Bowl champs.",
      "The Chargers face-planted 32-12 at Houston  on Saturday after taking a 6-0 lead into the second quarter, and the Broncos were blown out 31-7 at Buffalo after grabbing a 7-0 lead just five snaps into the game.",
      "The remaining teams \u2014 Baltimore, Buffalo and Houston \u2014 in the AFC field all could pose stiff challenges to the Chiefs. But Patrick Mahomes is 15-3 in the playoffs, has won his last seven postseason starts and is 4-0 against the AFC quarterbacks remaining in the playoffs.",
      "Josh Allen is 0-3 against Mahomes in the playoffs and 6-2 against everybody else. Lamar Jackson is 0-1 against Mahomes and 3-3 against others, and Stroud is 2-1 and will face Mahomes for the first time in the postseason Saturday, when Mahomes and several other starters will be coming off a whopping 24 days' rest.",
      "The Ravens and Bills meet in the other divisional round game while the Chargers and Broncos both look toward next season and ponder the painful lessons learned from their early exits.",
      "Though not nearly as strong as the NFC North, which produced the 15-2 Lions, 14-3 Vikings and 11-6 Packers, all playoff teams, the AFC West sent three teams to the postseason for the first time since 2013.",
      "\u201cOne of the things we learned early on is we got to find a way to play these games at home,\u201d coach Sean Payton said.",
      "That would mean upending the Chiefs, who have owned the division ever since Peyton Manning retired in 2016 and have averaged almost 13 wins a season since Mahomes became their starter in 2018.",
      "So, how close are the Broncos to knocking the Chiefs from their pedestal? Several players who were cleaning out their lockers Monday said they felt they were close, although one thought it was a gotcha question.",
      "\u201cI mean, if you look at us, we were in all those games, every single one of them,\u201d left tackle Garett Bolles said of the Broncos' 3-3 divisional record that included a sweep of Las Vegas and a pair of seven-point losses to the Chargers. \u201cNone of them were blowouts. We're right there. I think that we need to get some more playmakers but everything we have in this locker room, the core value, is here.",
      "\u201cThe sky's the limit for us and I think we're going to be exactly where we want to be.\u201d",
      "Asked how close he felt the Broncos were to catching the Chiefs, right guard Quinn Meinerz, fresh off his first All-Pro season, was having none of it.",
      "\u201cYou're already assuming the Chiefs,\u201d he retorted.",
      "Well, they have won nine consecutive division titles, second most ever behind the New England Patriots' 11-year dominance of the AFC East from 2009-19 under Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.",
      "\u201cWe're not even on to the next season yet,\u201d Meinerz interjected. \u201cI mean, I can't predict any of that. We just got done playing in the playoffs. I think that's kind of a, kind of baiting question to ask, to be honest.\"",
      "Are you around the corner, at least?",

      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\u201cThat was really jaw-dropping \u2013 it\u2019s never been observed before in European prehistory,\u201d said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2013 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \u201cit\u2019s your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife\u2019s family for land and livelihood,\u201d said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2013 called matrilocality \u2013 is historically rare.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2013 women leaving their homes to join their husband\u2019s family group \u2013 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives\u2019 extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2013 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2013 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain\u2019s Celtic society \u201cmore egalitarian than the Roman world,\u201d said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",

      "A nonprofit research lab is getting attention from some wealthy tech philanthropists",
      "MONTREAL -- Peeps trickle out of a soundproof chamber as its door opens. Female zebra finches are chattering away inside the microphone-lined box. The laboratory room sounds like a chorus of squeaky toys.",
      "\u201cThey're probably talking about us a little bit,\u201d says McGill University postdoctoral fellow Logan James.",
      "It's unclear, of course, what they are saying. But James believes he is getting closer to deciphering their vocalizations through a partnership with the Earth Species Project. The nonprofit laboratory has drawn some of the technology industry's wealthiest philanthropists \u2014 and they want to see more than just scientific progress. On top of breakthroughs in animal language, they expect improved interspecies understanding will foster greater appreciation for the planet in the face of climate change.",
      "The Earth Species Project hopes to decode other creatures' communications with its pioneering artificial intelligence tools. The goal is not to build a \u201ctranslator that will allow us to speak to other species,\u201d Director of Impact Jane Lawton said. However, she added, \u201crudimentary dictionaries\u201d for other animals are not only possible but could help craft better conservation strategies and reconnect humanity with often forgotten ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWe believe that by reminding people of the beauty, the sophistication, the intelligence that is resident in other species and in nature as a whole, we can start to, kind of, almost repair that relationship,\" Lawton said.",
      "At McGill University, the technology generates specific calls during simulated conversations with live finches that help researchers isolate each unique noise. The computer processes calls in real time and responds with one of its own. Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",
      "James, an affiliated researcher with the Earth Species Project, struggles with the concept of decoding animal communications. Sure, he can clearly distinguish when a chick is screaming for food. But he doesn\u2019t expect to ever translate that call or any others into a human word.",
      "Still, he wonders if he can gather more hints about their interactions from aspects of the call such as its pitch or duration.",
      "\u201cSo can we find a link between a form and function is sort of our way of maybe thinking about decoding,\" James said. \u201cAs she elongates her call, is that because she\u2019s trying harder to elicit a response?\u201d",

      "SpaceX has launched a pair of lunar landers for U.S. and Japanese companies looking to jumpstart business up there",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- In a two-for-one moonshot, SpaceX launched a pair of lunar landers Wednesday for U.S. and Japanese companies looking to jumpstart business on Earth\u2019s dusty sidekick.",
      "The two landers rocketed away in the middle of the night from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, the latest in a stream of private spacecraft aiming for the moon. They shared the ride to save money but parted company an hour into the flight exactly as planned, taking separate roundabout routes for the monthslong journey.",
      "It\u2019s take 2 for the Tokyo-based ispace, whose first lander crashed into the moon two years ago. This time, it has a rover on board with a scoop to gather up lunar dirt for study and plans to test potential food and water sources for future explorers.",
      "Lunar newcomer Texas-based Firefly Aerospace is flying 10 experiments for NASA, including a vacuum to gather dirt, a drill to measure the temperature below the surface and a device that could be used by future moonwalkers to keep the sharp, abrasive particles off their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a species of U.S. Southeastern fireflies \u2014 should reach the moon first. The 6-foot-6-inches-tall (2-meter-tall) lander will attempt a touchdown in early March at Mare Crisium, a volcanic plain in the northern latitudes.",
      "The slightly bigger ispace lander named Resilience will take four to five months to get there, targeting a touchdown in late May or early June at Mare Frigoris, even farther north on the moon\u2019s near side.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a race. Some people say \u2018race to the moon,\u2019 but it\u2019s not about the speed,\u201d ispace\u2019s founder CEO Takeshi Hakamada said this week from Cape Canaveral.",
      "Both Hakamada and Firefly CEO Jason Kim acknowledge the challenges still ahead, given the wreckage littering the lunar landscape. Only five countries have successfully placed spacecraft on the moon since the 1960s: the former Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can on the design and the engineering,\u201d Kim said. Even so, he pinned an Irish shamrock to his jacket lapel Tuesday night for good luck.",
      "The U.S. remains the only one to have landed astronauts. NASA\u2019s Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, aims to get astronauts back on the moon by the end of the decade.",
      "Before that can happen, \u201cwe\u2019re sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\u201d NASA's science mission chief Nicky Fox said on the eve of launch.",
      "If acing their respective touchdowns, both spacecraft will spend two weeks operating in constant daylight, shutting down once darkness hits.",
      "Once lowered onto the lunar surface, ispace\u2019s 11-pound (5-kilogram) rover will stay near the lander, traveling up to hundreds of yards (meters) in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. The rover has its own special delivery to drop off on the lunar dust: a toy-size red house designed by a Swedish artist.",
      "NASA is paying $101 million to Firefly for the mission and another $44 million for the experiments. Hakamada declined to divulge the cost of ispace\u2019s rebooted mission with six experiments, saying it's less than the first mission that topped $100 million.",
      "Coming up by the end of February is the second moonshot for NASA by Houston-based Intuitive Machines. Last year, the company achieved the first U.S. lunar touchdown in more than a half-century, landing sideways near the south pole but still managing to operate.",

      "With a possible TikTok ban just days away, many U.S. users are looking for alternative social media platforms to help them keep up with pop culture or provide the type of entertaining videos that popularized the short-form video app.",
      "TikTok, which has been a cultural phenomenon, could be banned on Jan. 19 under a law that forces the platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or shut down its U.S. operation.",
      "The fate of social media platform will be decided by the Supreme Court, which last week heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute and seemed likely to uphold the law. The court could rule on the case as soon as this week. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has asked the justices to put the law on hold so he can negotiate a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue after he takes office.",
      "TikTok has more than 170 million users in the U.S., and if it does get banned, it\u2019s not clear which competitors will benefit the most. Some experts think established social media platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, could see the biggest influx of users. But some users are looking for something different and could turn to other apps.",
      "Here are the different alternatives and what to know about them:",
      "Recently, some U.S. TikTok users have flocked to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu in protest of the looming ban. Like TikTok, Xiaohongshu, which in English means \u201cLittle Red Book,\u201d combines e-commerce and short-form videos.",
      "The app has gained traction in China and other regions with a Chinese diaspora \u2014 such as Malaysia and Taiwan \u2014 racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as makeup and skincare tutorials.",
      "On Tuesday, the Xiaohongshu, called \u201cRedNote\u201d by American users and on some app stores, was the top downloaded free app in Apple\u2019s U.S. app store.",
      "Lemon8, also owned by TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance, is a lesser-known lifestyle app that allows users to post pictures and short-form videos. Though the platform lets users post TikTok-like videos, it leans more into pictures and has been described as a mixture of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "In the past few weeks, many creators have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also recommended it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, indicating a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But the law that targets TikTok also states the divest-or-ban requirement for ByteDance applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by the two companies or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 is not explicitly named in the statute, its future in the U.S. is also in jeopardy.",
      "Instagram launched Reels in 2020, a TikTok-like feed of short videos users can create or scroll through. The feature has proven to be massively popular and some experts say creators are likely to set up shop there if a TikTok ban does happen. As of 2022, Instagram had 2 billion active monthly users. Meta no longer discloses user numbers for its individual platforms.",
      "But could it replace TikTok? That depends. While many creators currently post on both platforms, some experts say the youngest users are unlikely to migrate to a service made popular by their millennial parents. And while Meta\u2019s algorithm is addictive, it\u2019s still not TikTok.",
      "In the past, some TikTok users have also blamed the surge of scrutiny on the platform on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, pointing to a Washington Post report from 2022 that said the tech behemoth paid a Republican consulting firm to undermine TikTok through a nationwide media and lobbying campaign.",
      "Though TikTok dominates headlines as a driver of internet trends, Pew Research Center says YouTube is actually the most widely-used platform among teens and adults.",
      "YouTube users can scroll through Shorts just as they can on TikTok or Reels on Instagram and Facebook, allowing them to watch hours of bite-sized videos. Many of the videos featured on YouTube are from TikTok or creators who post to several platforms. That said, YouTube is still known for its longer-format videos so it may not have the variety of content that TikTok users are looking for \u2014 at least not yet.",
      "Snapchat, launched in 2011 with its infamous disappearing videos, remains popular among teens and younger adults. The platform gained so much traction that Meta designed a similar feature in Facebook and Instagram called \u201cStories\u201d that lets users post photos or videos that disappear within 24 hours. In 2020, Snapchat launched another feature that lets users \u201cshine a light on the most entertaining Snaps, no matter who created them.\u201d",
      "The platform is estimated to have roughly 692 million global monthly active users last year, according to eMarketer.",
      "For TikTok users who enjoy the \u201cTikTok Live\u201d feed that features livestreamed videos, Twitch could be a good alternative. The Amazon-owned platform is a leader in the streaming industry and allows users on the platform to watch some of the internet\u2019s most popular streamers, such as Kai Cenat. Twitch says it has 105 million monthly visitors.",
      "Clapper, a TikTok clone, has also been gaining some traction amid the looming ban. The app was launched in 2020 by Dallas-based entrepreneur Edison Chen, and focuses on Gen X and millennial users. In September of that year, the company described itself in a Facebook post as a \u201cfree speech\u201d platform that did not \u201ccensor posts and comments.\u201d But in blog post on its website from 2021, the company wrote it \u201cstopped being a \u2018Free Speech\u2019 platform\u201d in September 2020 and \u201cchanged its mission and goals\u201d to focus on \u201ccommunity\u201d.",
      "For TikTok users who want to get away from the overcrowded spots, there are lesser-known apps like Triller, which is popular for music videos, and Zigazoo, which was designed with kids in mind.",
      "If none of these apps tickle your fancy, it's also possible that other platforms could emerge in the next few months as companies attempt to attract users looking for a new place to go."

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on Monday signed a bill restricting the use of smartphones at school, following a global trend for such limitations.",
      "The move will impact students at elementary and high schools across the South American nation starting in February. It provides a legal framework to ensure students only use such devices in cases of emergency and danger, for educational purposes, or if they have disabilities and require them.",
      "\"We cannot allow humanism to be replaced by algorithms,\u201d Lula said in a closed ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital, Brasilia, adding that the bill \u201cacknowledges the work of every serious person in education, everyone who wants to take care of children and teenagers in this country.\u201d",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, one of the world's highest figures.",
      "Education minister Camilo Santana told journalists that children are going online at early ages, making it harder for parents to keep track of what they do, and that restricting smartphones at school will help them.",

      "Many parents and students also approved the move. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents supported banning the use of smartphones by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",

      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",

      "TikTok's parent company is based in China, and the U.S. government says that means it is a potential national security threat. Chinese authorities could force it to hand over sensitive data on the huge number of Americans who use it or could influence the spread of information on the platform, they say.",
      "An appeals court has upheld the law, which bans TikTok unless it's sold.",
      "The law is set to take effect Jan. 19, the day before a new term begins for President-elect Donald Trump, who has 14.7 million followers on the platform. The Republican says he wants to \u201csave TikTok.\"",
      "Here are some key things to know about the case:",
      "Not now, but the short-form video-sharing app could be shut down in less than two weeks if the Supreme Court upholds the law.",
      "Congress passed the measure with bipartisan support, and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signed it into law in April.",
      "TikTok\u2019s lawyers challenged the law in court, joined by users and content creators who say a ban would upend their livelihoods. TikTok says the national security concerns are based on inaccurate and hypothetical information.",
      "But a unanimous appeals court panel made up of judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents has upheld the law.",
      "The justices will issue a decision after arguments Friday, a lightning-fast movement by court standards.",
      "The conservative-majority court could drop clues about how it's leaning during oral arguments.",
      "TikTok lawyers have urged the justices to step in before the law takes effect, saying even a monthlong shutdown would cause the app to lose about one-third of its daily American users and significant advertising revenue.",
      "The court could quickly block the law from going into effect before issuing a final ruling, if at least five of the nine justices think it is unconstitutional.",
      "The law is to take effect Jan. 19, the day before Trump takes over as president.",
      "He took the unusual step of filing court documents asking the Supreme Court to put the law on hold so that he could negotiate a deal for the sale of TikTok after he takes office. His position marked the latest example of him inserting himself into national issues before he takes office. It also was a change from his last presidential term, when he wanted to ban it.",
      "Parent company ByteDance has previously said it has no plans to sell. Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, last month.",
      "Free-speech advocacy groups like the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have urged the court to block the law, saying the government hasn't shown credible evidence of harm and a ban would cause \u201cextraordinary disruption\u201d in Americans' lives.",
      "On the other side, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican former Senate leader, and a group of 22 states have filed briefs in support, arguing that the law protects free speech by safeguarding Americans' data and preventing the possible manipulation of information on the platform by Chinese authorities.",

      "In a collision between free speech and national security, the Supreme Court will hear arguments over the fate of TikTok, a digital age cultural phenomenon that roughly half the U.S. population uses for entertainment and information",
      "WASHINGTON -- In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\u201cRarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\u201d lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \u201cno one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\u201d",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\u201d D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice to be his administration\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump\u2019s solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law\u2019s most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",

      "Analysis of the ancient ice is expected to show how Earth's atmosphere and climate have evolved. That should provide insight into how Ice Age cycles have changed, and may help in understanding how atmospheric carbon changed climate, they said.",
      "\u201cThanks to the ice core we will understand what has changed in terms of greenhouse gases, chemicals and dusts in the atmosphere,\u201d said Carlo Barbante, an Italian glaciologist and coordinator of Beyond EPICA, the project to obtain the core. Barbante also directs the Polar Science Institute at Italy's National Research Council.",
      "The same team previously drilled a core about 800,000 years old. The latest drilling went 2.8 kilometers (about 1.7 miles) deep, with a team of 16 scientists and support personnel drilling each summer over four years in average temperatures of about minus-35 Celsius (minus-25.6 Fahrenheit).",
      "Italian researcher Federico Scoto was among the glaciologists and technicians who completed the drilling at the beginning of January at a location called Little Dome C, near Concordia Research Station.",
      "\u201cIt was a great a moment for us when we reached the bedrock,\u201d Scoto said. Isotope analysis gave the ice's age as at least 1.2 million years old, he said.",
      "Both Barbante and Scoto said that thanks to the analysis of the ice core of the previous Epica campaign they have assessed that concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, even during the warmest periods of the last 800,000 years, have never exceeded the levels seen since the Industrial Revolution began.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Interior lighting aimed at reducing motion sickness. Shiny holographic dashboards displayed on windshields. And AI-powered voice assistants paired with infotainment systems to keep you company on long drives.",
      "Automakers pulled out all the stops to showcase their latest advances for in-vehicle experiences at CES, the Consumer Technology Association\u2019s annual trade show of all things tech, in Las Vegas this week. Hyundai Mobis unveiled a full-windshield holographic technology, while BMW spotlighted its new \u201ciDrive\u201d panoramic display. And Honda and Sony Honda Mobility showed what consumers can expect with their upcoming electric vehicles.",
      "Many of these driving enhancements aim to \u201cmake life on board more comfortable,\u201d explains Axel Maschka, executive vice president and head of the business division at Hyundai Mobis. And for some consumers today, he adds, \u201cthis \u2018living space\u2019\" of a car's interior has become a dominant part of a vehicle's appeal.",
      "Hyundai Mobis' holographic windshield display provides a glimpse into that. The technology, which won't be on the market for at least several more years, projects information ranging from driving speed to safety alerts across the entire windshield, and also provides some entertainment options for those who aren\u2019t behind the wheel. To keep the driver's eyes on the road, the panoramic display looks different depending on where you sit. A demo from the South Korean company shows the front row passenger can watch a movie or play a video game projected ahead of them, for example, but it's not visible to the driver.",
      "Maschka claims the holographic windshield gives drivers an easier view of key information in their line of sight and keeps other distractions in the car out of sight.",
      "Car safety experts have long stressed that keeping drivers' eyes on the road is critical. Simplicity is also key, says Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an education and research nonprofit. Too many visual display features can be overwhelming, he explains.",

Still, Reagan says he's encouraged by recent developments in panoramic displays that aim to keep key, minimal information in a car's line of sight.",
      "Beyond Hyundai Mobis, that's part of what BMW, which showed off its new Panoramic iDrive and Operating System X, also says it's trying to do. The system, which will be integrated into of new models starting later this year, projects a panoramic display onto the vehicles' lower windscreen.",
      "The technology offers a range of digital features and can be personalized by different colors, apps and other preferences. But in the driver's line of sight, Stephan Durach, BMW\u2019s Head of UI/UX Development, said the goal was to avoid redundancies.",

The Israelis will take the agreement back to their government for approval, he said.",
      "The agreement will begin on Sunday, with the first, six-week phase seeing the withdrawal of some Israeli forces to allow more aid to get in and the release of 33 hostages in Gaza, starting with women, children and the elderly, according to the Qatari prime minister. A number of Palestinian prisoners will be released, as well, he said.",
      "According to the Hamas delegation in Doha, the provisions Hamas agreed to include the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphi corridor, in stages, and handing over 33 Israeli prisoners, dead and alive, in exchange for the release of 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Negotiations would be completed in stages for the release of the remaining hostages, according to the Hamas delegation.",
      "The Israeli prime minister's office said in a statement that they resolved an issue over forces on the Philadelphi corridor, though there are several \"unresolved clauses\" in the deal they hope to finalize Wednesday night.",
      "Israel said its security cabinet will convene on Thursday to approve the deal.",
      "The provisions also include the opening of the Rafah crossing, according to the Hamas delegation. Coordination is currently underway to open the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing to allow the entry of international aid into Gaza, an Egyptian security source told ABC News.",
      "The second and third phases of the agreement will be finalized after the first phase, the Qatari prime minister said. Phase two will mark a \"permanent end of the war,\" President Joe Biden said during remarks Wednesday.",
      "Under phase two, the remaining living hostages will be released and all remaining Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza, according to Biden. The remains of the final hostages will be returned in phase three and a \"major reconstruction plan for Gaza will begin,\" Biden said.",

      "In over a year of war between Israel and Hamas, more than 46,000 people have been killed in Gaza and almost 110,000 injured, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. That figure does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. However, more than 14,000 children and 8,000 women have been killed, according to the health ministry.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they have killed more than 15,000 combatants throughout the course of the war, which was sparked by the unprecedented Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in southern Israel. More than 1,200 people were killed and another 253 were taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.",
      "During a weeklong ceasefire between Hamas and Israel in late November 2023, Hamas freed more than 100 people. In exchange, Israel released more than 200 Palestinians from Israeli prisons. Several hostages in Gaza have also been freed in the months since, while the bodies of others have been recovered.",
      "Amid the renewed negotiations in early January, 94 abductees remained in Gaza, including 34 who have been confirmed dead, according to Israeli officials.",

      "Following news of a ceasefire and hostage deal being reached on Wednesday, people could be seen celebrating across Gaza and Israel.",
      "Biden said the deal followed \"many months of intensive diplomacy by the United States, along with Egypt and Qatar.\"",
      "\"This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much-needed humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity,\" Biden said in a statement.",
      "\"My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done,\" he added.",
      "Biden said he is determined to bring seven American hostages home, three of whom are alive. Americans will be part of the first phase of the hostage release, with more details to come on who will be included in the first phase, he said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump also said Wednesday that a hostage deal has been reached, writing in a Truth Social post, \"WE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!\"",
      "Trump took credit for what he called an \"EPIC\" ceasefire agreement, saying it \"could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November.\" He said his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel and U.S. allies to \"make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven.\"",
      "The families of seven American hostages in Gaza said they are \"deeply grateful\" that an agreement for the phased release of hostages has been reached.",
      "\"The coming days and weeks will be just as painful for our families as the entirety of our loved ones' horrific ordeals,\" the families said in a statement. \"That is why we ask all parties to stay committed to this agreement, every phase until it is fully implemented and everyone has been returned. We feel hopeful that under President Trump's leadership, every last hostage will come home.\"",
      "A new round of ceasefire negotiations began on Jan. 3 in Qatar. Delegations from both Israel and Hamas were dispatched to Doha to resume the negotiations, which were brokered by Qatari and Egyptian mediators. The Biden administration also helped broker the talks.",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken had previously told reporters the United States wanted a ceasefire deal in Gaza and all remaining captives released before Trump takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Blinken on Jan. 6 reported \"intensified engagement,\" including by Hamas, on reaching a deal, though he added, \"We are yet to see agreement on final points.\"",
      "\"We need Hamas to make the final necessary decisions to complete the agreement and to fundamentally change the circumstance for the hostages, getting them out, for people in Gaza, bringing them relief, and for the region as a whole, creating an opportunity to actually move forward to something better, more secure for everyone involved,\" Blinken said at the time.",
      "The deal comes after a ceasefire deal was reached between Israel and Hezbollah in November 2024, weeks after Israel invaded southern Lebanon as part of an escalation of its conflict with Hezbollah.",
      "It also follows the high-profile assassinations last year of Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar -- with Sinwar being one of the key architects of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel -- as well as Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel has claimed responsibility for their deaths.",

    "summary": "Polling shows many Americans blame climate change for the Los Angeles wildfires.",
    "story": [
      "Polling shows many Americans blame climate change for the disaster.",
      "Devastating wildfires have now been burning in greater Los Angeles for over a week, and the scale of the disaster is hard to overstate. Whether measured by number of deaths, number of structures destroyed or the total cost of the damages, the Los Angeles fires already look like they are among the worst on record \u2014 and, unfortunately, those numbers are likely to keep rising as the fires continue to burn.",
      "Of the various fires that have ignited around Los Angeles since last Tuesday, the two biggest have been the Palisades Fire, centered on the Pacific Palisades neighborhood on the west side of the city, and the Eaton Fire, centered on the northeastern suburb of Altadena. Together, they have so far killed 25 people and destroyed more than 12,000 structures. That already places these two fires alone among the deadliest and most destructive wildfires in California history.",
      "Only the 2018 Camp Fire was more catastrophic than the current rash of fires. That fire in Northern California's Butte County killed 85 people and destroyed nearly 19,000 structures.",
      "However, it's likely that the Los Angeles fires are already the costliest wildfires in history \u2014 not only in California, but in all of the U.S. These fires are unique in that they are tearing through one of the most densely populated cities in the country with some of the highest home values. Moody's and insurance broker Aon PLC have already said that they believe the fires will wind up being the most expensive in U.S. history.",
      "They could even end up ranking as one of the most expensive natural disasters of any kind \u2014 a shocking fact considering that wildfires are not typically as costly as other disasters, like hurricanes. For instance, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S.'s costliest natural disaster since 1980 was Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which caused $201.3 billion in damages in today's dollars; the most expensive wildfire event was the series of California wildfires in 2018 that included the Camp Fire, which cost \"only\" $30.0 billion in today's money.",
      "AccuWeather has already issued an eye-popping preliminary estimate that the current fires will cost $250-275 billion. However, that isn't directly comparable to the numbers in the table above. AccuWeather's estimates include the costs of evacuations, government expenditures to clean up from the disaster and long-term impacts on industries such as tourism; as a result, their numbers are often much higher than official estimates. For instance, AccuWeather estimated damages from 2024's Hurricane Helene at $225-250 billion, while NOAA's estimate is lower at $78.7 billion. Still, if the final official cost of the Los Angeles wildfires comes in at around $80 million, that would make them the seventh-costliest American natural disaster of the last 45 years.",
      "As you can tell from the table, the majority of the most expensive natural disasters have come in just the last 13 years \u2014 even adjusting for population growth. One frequently cited factor for this is that human-caused climate change is making natural disasters more severe and more frequent. Indeed, studies have found a link between climate change and the increased number of wildfires specifically. Wildfires thrive in droughts and high temperatures, and climate change has made these things more common.",
      "While it's difficult to directly attribute any one fire to climate change \u2014 the most common causes of wildfires are lightning strikes, arson and sparking power lines, and the cause of the current fires is still under investigation \u2014 Los Angeles County has received virtually no rain since the summer, which was its hottest in 130 years. That has kept local vegetation bone-dry and highly flammable well into what is supposed to be the rainy season. (That said, there is no evidence that the high winds that have spread these fires have gotten worse due to climate change.)",
      "Accordingly, many Americans blame the changing climate for the disaster, at least in part. According to a YouGov poll from Jan. 10, 65 percent of Americans believed that climate change was at least somewhat responsible for the extent of recent wildfires \u2014 including 24 percent who thought it was mostly responsible for them and 11 percent who thought it was entirely responsible for them. Unsurprisingly, there was a partisan split on the question, with 88 percent of Democrats believing climate change was at least somewhat responsible, but only 46 percent of Republicans. An Emerson College poll from Jan. 10-11 found something similar: 58 percent of registered voters told the pollster that they thought climate change had contributed to the wildfires, including 85 percent of Democrats but 36 percent of Republicans.",
      "And for many Americans, these wildfires might just be the latest thing convincing them that climate change is having real, and disastrous, consequences. According to regular polling from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication, the share of American adults who believe people in the U.S. are being harmed by climate change \"right now\" has risen gradually over the last 15 years.",
      "Similarly, the share of Americans who say they've personally experienced the effects of climate change has risen from 23 percent in January 2010 to 49 percent in April 2024. As climate change becomes less conceptual and more immediate to an increasing number of Americans with every passing disaster, it's possible that pressure could build on the government to take more drastic action to address it.",

His last words to me that day were, 'Pray for the Palisades and pray for Malibu. I love you.'\"",

      "Firefighters battle disastrous flames across 45 square miles.",
      "While raging flames, persistent smoke and damaging winds continue to plague residents in Los Angeles County, farmers across Southern California are also facing the possibility of devastating damage to their crops.",
      "Julia Zorthian and her family have lived and worked at Zorthian Ranch in Altadena, California, since her grandfather purchased the property in the 1940s. The land has hosted summer camps, taught people how to milk goats and grew citrus and nut trees. But after the Eaton Fire devastated their community, 39 of the farm's 40 acres have been destroyed --\u00a0leaving the family without a livelihood or a place to call home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so much crazier than anyone could have ever imagined the fire could be,\" Zorthian told ABC News. \"The places we thought would be safe spaces to keep things that probably wouldn\u2019t get damaged ended up incinerating.\u201d",
      "Alba Velasquez, the executive director of the Los Angeles Food Policy Council, told ABC News that farmers face two hurdles, namely economic and air quality challenges.",
      "\u201cOur farmers are our backbone of our local food system, and these fires remind us how fragile that system can be,\u201d Velasquez said.",
      "Currently, Velsquez said there are about 24 farms that are affected by the Eaton Fire, with numbers increasing every day. Velasquez said that could include issues with air quality, flames, smoke or just economic impacts.",
      "For families like Zorthian's, the only option is to start over.",
      "\u201cWe will rebuild, but it will never be what it was,\" Zorthian said. \"That was about 80 years of work and artistry.\u201d",
      "Peter Ansel, director of policy advocacy at the California Farmers Bureau, told ABC News that the smoke poses a particular threat, including \u201cto people, animals on ranches or on the end-products themselves.\u201d In 2020, smoke from nearby wildfires ruined crops at vineyards in Wine Country.",
      "Others who are not facing the smoke or flames are still struggling to sell their goods, since many farmers markets in Los Angeles County are shut down or receiving a limited amount of visitors.",
      "Craig Underwood, owner of Underwood Family Farms in Moorpark, California, said dangerous conditions prevented the crew from attending the Brentwood market and poor air quality resulted in few visitors at the Pasadena market -- drastically diminishing their sales.",
      "\u201cThere will be long-term economic impacts,\u201d Underwood told ABC News. \u201cWe count on those farmers markets for selling a lot of those produce.\u201d",
      "The damaging winds from the past week have led to several power outages on Underwood\u2019s farm and has increased the risk of scarring their lemons. Until the gusts diminish, the farm will be closed.",
      "\u201cRight now, the lemon market is not that strong, so to have our quality degraded really hurts,\u201d Underwood said. \u201cFruits and vegetables sell by appearance as much as anything else.\u201d",
      "While large fires haven't broken out farther south in San Diego County, abnormally strong winds are still wreaking havoc on farms.",
      "Andy Lyall, a fourth-generation citrus and avocado grower in Pauma Valley, California, north of San Diego, is part of a tight-knit, family business that goes back to 1933. Lyall told ABC News he is accustomed to strong gusts, but the violent Santa Ana winds fanning the recent California wildfires were completely unexpected.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten through a lot of winds, but this one just hammered us,\u201d Lyall said.",
      "These disastrous winds, which swirled through Lyall\u2019s avocado trees, destroyed about 50% of his crops, he said. Avocados are the fourth-largest crop in the area, according to the San Diego County Farm Bureau. But Lyall said the destruction from these winds will ultimately change those numbers.",
      "\u201cThis really will hurt the supply of avocados,\u201d Lyall said. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant crop that we grow in our county and this is definitely going to impact the supply of safe, locally produced produce that will be in the stores this upcoming spring and summer.\u201d",
      "Along with Lyall, many farmers are experiencing direct and indirect impacts from these continuous flames.",
      "The California Department of Food and Agriculture recommends farmers who have experienced crop loss to look into their Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program, which \u201dpays covered producers of covered noninsurable crops when low yields, loss of inventory, or prevented planting occur due to natural disasters,\u201d according to the website. The Los Angeles Food Policy Council and the Community Alliance with Family Farmers also provide post-wildlife recovery resources.",
      "When farmers are limited on resources, missing market events or losing everything they own, Velasquez said community members will be less likely to find produce locally, and will instead rely on big-box grocery stores.",
      "\u201cWe all eat food, all of it impacts our daily lives, whether we are farmers or not,\u201d Velasquez said.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 16:31:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has issued an executive order to rebuild homes and businesses amid the wildfires.",
    "story": [
      "The order aims to expedite permit reviews and prepare for further disaster.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has issued an executive order to rebuild homes and businesses that the city lost in the ongoing LA County fires that overall have so far burned more than 40,000 acres and destroyed more than 12,000 structures",
      "The executive order calls for city agencies to expedite temporary occupancy approvals for 1,400 housing units that are near completion, and the establishment of a \"Debris Removal Task Force\" and \"Watershed Hazards Task Force\" to respectively develop plans for debris removal and mitigate the risks and dangers of post-fire flash floods, mudslides and debris flows.",
      "The order also calls for city agencies to collectively expedite the building permit review process, calling for reviews to be done in 30 days following the submission of an application. Inspections by the Department of Building and Safety are to be conducted in two business days of a submitted request, according to the order.",
      "For structures being rebuilt, city agencies will be required to process necessary clearances and releases related to building permit applications and certificates of occupancy within five business days, the order states.",
      "The order notes that eligible rebuilds under these requirements must be rebuilt at the same location where they previously existed, used for the same use as the previous structure and are not to exceed 110% of the floor area, height, and bulk of the previous structure.",
      "\u201cThis unprecedented natural disaster warrants an unprecedented response that will expedite the rebuilding of homes, businesses and communities,\u201d Bass said in a statement. \u201cThis order is the first step in clearing away red tape and bureaucracy to organize around urgency, common sense and compassion. We will do everything we can to get Angelenos back home.\u201d",
      "Bass received criticism for being away from the city on a planned diplomatic trip to Ghana when the Palisades Fire first erupted and has been hit by critics for her leadership, particularly from her 2022 Republican mayoral opponent Rick Caruso who claimed Bass was \"abandoning her post\" during the tragedy in an interview with Politico.",
      "Bass, who posted a warning about the windstorm on social media ahead of the wildfires, told reporters Wednesday, Jan. 8, the day after the fire started, that she took the \"fastest route back, which included being on a military plane.\"",
      "The wildfires have been predicted by financial analysts to \"be the costliest wildfire event in California history,\" with Goldman Sachs estimating total losses at $40 billion.",
      "With families displaced across the county, the wildfires have put pressure on communities already facing housing crises. California, and specifically Los Angeles County, has some of the highest rent and home costs in the country, according to the California Legislative Analyst's Office, with mid-tier homes priced more than twice as high as an average mid-tier home in the United States.",
      "According to Apartments.com, renters also face challenges: the average rent in Los Angeles is 39% higher than the national average rent, the real estate research organization states.",
      "High housing and living costs are highlighted by the state's troubles tackling homelessness, with more homeless residents than any other state.",
      "According to the U.S. Office of Housing and Urban Development, the availability of housing for individuals and families experiencing homelessness in the area led to a decline in homelessness for the first time in 7 years.",
      "Los Angeles County\u2019s point-in-time estimate of homelessness declined by 0.27%, while the city estimated a decline of 2.2%. The unsheltered homeless population decreased by larger margins, with the county decreasing it by 5.1% and the city decreasing it by 10.4%.",
      "Addressing homelessness and the lack of affordable housing in the region was a key piece of Bass' campaign, though not without controversy and hurdles.",
      "In December 2022, Bass declared a state of emergency concerning homelessness on her first day in office.",
      "Bass' Executive Directive 1, aimed at expediting thousands of affordable housing projects, was  also criticized by some residents for targeting areas with rent-controlled apartments that had tenants in place who would be displaced by demolition and construction or for potentially impacting wealthier, designated historic districts.",
      "The plan was recently updated in the summer of 2024 to restrict where these projects can be built by avoiding historic districts or displacing current tenants. The moves have been criticized for ultimately hindering efforts to build more affordable housing and leaving low-income housing in the balance, according to local news outlets.",
      "Bass' latest order does not note how it may impact the creation of these affordable housing projects.",
      "Since the start of her tenure, she founded Inside Safe, a program to house homeless residents in local hotels and motels. According to local reports, the program faced pushback from hotel and motel owners tasked with housing the participants and was criticized for the poor living conditions faced by those being sheltered.",
      "The program's website states it has placed more than 3,600 people in temporary housing and more than 700 in permanent housing so far.",
      "Overall, Bass' office states it has moved 23,000 homeless residents into temporary housing and doubled the number of residents it has moved into permanent housing.",

    "summary": "Hydroclimate whiplash -- the rapid shift between wet and dry conditions -- likely contributed to the severity of the wildfires in Southern California, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The state's naturally variable climate increases its wildfire risk.",
      "Hydroclimate whiplash -- the rapid shift between wet and dry conditions -- likely contributed to the severity of the wildfires burning in Southern California, according to experts.",
      "In recent years, parts of the state shifted from a major drought to an extended period of above-average precipitation that allowed for abundant vegetation growth. After that, a stretch of intense, record-breaking heat dried out much of that vegetation and provided ample fuel for large and fast-growing wildfires.",
      "The Los Angeles region experienced two \"extraordinarily wet\" winters -- in 2023 and 2024 -- followed by dry conditions that began in February, Edith de Guzman, a water equity and adaptation policy cooperative extension specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told ABC News. Since May 6, Los Angeles has only seen 0.16 inches of rain, so the region\u2019s rainy season is off to an unusually dry start.",
      "\"Right now, we essentially have had no measurable precipitation since last spring, which has dried out all of that vegetation that grew happily over the last two wet winters,\" De Guzman said.",
      "The shrub cover that popped up as a result of the extra precipitation later dried out -- providing large volumes of fuel for a fire, De Guzman said.",
      "Combined with the highly flammable materials many of the houses were constructed with, such as wood frames, it was a recipe for disaster, De Guzman said.",
      "In Southern California, dry conditions are also now more likely to last later into the fall, leaving the region more vulnerable during high wind events, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with both UCLA and UC Agriculture and Natural Resources.",
      "\"Climate change is increasing the overlap between extremely dry vegetation conditions later in the season and the occurrence of these wind events,\" Swain said.",
      "Hydroclimate variability has always been a staple of California's natural climate, leaving it particularly vulnerable to wildfires.",
      "Among all of the states in the continental U.S., California has the most year-to-year variability between wet and dry conditions.",
      "\"As you move down into Southern California, that variability increases even more,\" Julie Kalansky, climate scientist and deputy director of operations at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the University of California, San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, told ABC News.",
      "However, some climate experts point to growing evidence that shows climate change has increased the volatility between very dry and very wet conditions around the world, like moving from a devastating drought to record-breaking precipitation and then back to a drought. These rapid swings between extreme weather events will amplify many of the associated hazards and contribute to devastating wildfire events.",
      "Climate change could also be making wild weather swings more common and more extreme, according to new research published in Nature Reviews Earth & Environment and the Fifth National Climate Assessment, a breakdown of the latest in climate science coming from 14 federal agencies, published in November 2023.",
      "\"These hotter, dry conditions that are driven by climate change have created a tinderbox,\" said Rachel Cleetus, policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"We have this dried out vegetation, very dry landscapes.\"",
      "But hydrovariability alone didn\u2019t lead to the devastating fires over the past week. A \"confluence\" of events allowed the fires to explode instantly, Cleetus said.",
      "It was the wind that spread the fires so rapidly once they were ignited. An exceptionally strong mountain wave wind event, with northerly 80 mph to 100 mph gusts, spread the fires faster than anyone could stop them.",
      "\"We experienced the most intense Santa Ana winds in nearly 15 years,\" De Guzman said.",
      "Conditions higher up in the atmosphere helped to further enhance winds at the surface.",
      "Cold, dense air associated with a low pressure system in the upper atmosphere was moving over Baja California. That air was positioned at a favorable north-northeast to northeast trajectory over the region allowing for the colder air located higher up in the atmosphere to come rushing down towards the surface and enhance the winds already blowing.",
      "This brought surges of powerful winds across the Los Angeles and Ventura County Mountains -- including in some places that don't typically see winds that strong, like Burbank and in the foothills of the Pacific Palisades.",
      "The wind direction and topography played a major role as well. The San Gabriel Mountains and the wind orientation interacted to produce a damaging wind event that doesn't occur often. The mountains can also make the winds more erratic because additional whirls of wind, known as wind eddies, can form as the air moves across the peaks and through the canyons.",
      "\"They were extremely strong and fast, but they were also erratic,\" De Guzman said. \"They typically are narrower and a little bit more predictable in direction.\"",

      "According to police, Carmichael was last seen at 3:46 a.m. on Sunday, Jan. 14, at the Exxon gas station on 809 East Market St. in Greensboro and made a distressed call to 911 just before she vanished.",
      "In the 911 call \u2013 the audio of which was obtained by ABC News \u2014 Carmichael appeared distressed and was asking for help finding a ride home. According to an incident report obtained by ABC News, when police arrived at the gas station, Carmichael wasn\u2019t there.",

      "Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio must pay a $475,000 fine levied against him for misusing public funds during his failed White House bid, a judge ruled this week",
      "NEW YORK -- Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio must pay a $475,000 fine levied against him for misusing public funds on a police security detail during his failed White House bid, a judge ruled this week, dismissing the ex-mayor\u2019s legal challenge as \u201cperplexing\u201d and \u201centirely baseless.\u201d",
      "The decision blocks de Blasio\u2019s latest effort to erase the hefty fine issued against him by the city\u2019s ethics board in 2023. In his motion for dismissal, de Blasio argued the board provided him with murky guidance around the use of public funds for security purposes, then overstepped its authority in imposing the fine.",
      "Judge Shahabuddeen Ally roundly rejected those arguments in an 80-page ruling issued Monday, finding the mayor was \u201cexpressly and specifically\u201d informed that the city would not bear security travel costs for the cross-country campaign, but elected to bring his police detail anyway.",
      "\u201c(His) position essentially eliminates his own agency in the choices he made,\u201d the judge wrote, adding that there was no merit to \u201cthe remarkable contention that he is somehow not subject to the City\u2019s conflicts-of-interest laws.\u201d",
      "The ruling leaves de Blasio on the hook for a $320,000 in airfare and other travel costs incurred by his security detail during the four-month campaign, which he launched in 2019 while serving his second term as mayor. He will also have to pay a fine of $5,000 for each of the security detail\u2019s 31 out-of-state trips, amounting to $155,000.",
      "The fine was the largest ever handed down by New York\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Board, an independent city agency tasked with holding local officials to certain ethical standards.",
      "Carolyn Lisa Miller, the executive director of the board, said the judge's ruling \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d",
      "An attorney for de Blasio, Andrew G. Celli Jr., declined to comment. De Blasio did not return a text message.",
      "In the court filing, attorneys for de Blasio argued that forcing him to cover the cost of his security detail\u2019s travel expenses violated his 1st Amendment rights, creating an \u201cunequal burden\u201d between wealthy candidates and career public servants.",
      "They added that paying the reimbursement would have \u201cno appreciable effect on the budget of the NYPD.\u201d",
      "De Blasio has faced previous allegations of misusing his security detail. Months before he left office in 2021, a report by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation found he treated the officers as a \u201cconcierge service,\u201d using them to move his daughter into an apartment and shuttle his son to college.",
      "Since leaving office in 2021, de Blasio has worked as a lecturer at multiple universities, most recently the University of Michigan, and delivered paid speeches in Italy.",

      "A North Carolina man was arrested after federal prosecutors say he tried to fly to Morocco to join the Islamic State group last month",
      "A North Carolina man was arrested while trying to board an overseas flight so that he could join the Islamic State group, according to a federal complaint that was unsealed Tuesday.",
      "Alexander Justin White, a U.S. citizen from Durham, is accused of providing, attempting and conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization by federal prosecutors. White's Dec. 4 arrest came after a monthslong investigation into numerous pro-IS messages that prosecutors say the 29-year-old sent to various Facebook users and an undercover FBI agent.",
      "White, who went by Sulaiman Al-Amriki \u2014 which means Sulaiman the American \u2014 on social media for part of last year, posted pro-IS content several times on Facebook between June and October 2024, prosecutors said. Some of the content included IS and other Islamic extremist propaganda videos.",
      "During this period, federal prosecutors said White spoke to several social media users who claimed to be from the Middle East and North Africa about his support for IS. He told several users that he wished to travel to Africa to join IS as well, according to court documents. White also lamented missed opportunities to join the militant group in previous trips \u2014 such as in a 2018 visit to Egypt \u2014 in conversations online, authorities said.",
      "White also conversed frequently with a covert FBI agent over several months, which included several mentions of wanting to join IS and a staged video call that White believed was with an IS commander's spokesperson, prosecutors said.",
      "During text conversations with the agent, officials said White expressed his willingness to be a mujahid, the Arabic word for \u201choly warrior,\u201d and discussed fundraising for detained IS members and their family members.",
      "After several months of discussing his plans to travel abroad and join IS, White sent the agent a screenshot of his upcoming travel itinerary, which showed a Dec. 4 flight departing from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport to Rabat, Morocco, court records show.",
      "To not raise suspicions about the flight, White purchased a round-trip ticket, prosecutors said.",
      "White later arrived on Dec. 4 with three bags at RDU Airport, where he checked in for his connecting flight to Paris and proceeded through security, authorities said. He was then arrested a few hours later while attempting to board the plane.",
      "A federal public defender who was appointed to represent White declined to comment about the pending case on Wednesday.",

      "Delta Air Lines fourth-quarter results topped analysts\u2019 expectations as travel demand was strong during the crucial holiday period",
      "Delta Air Lines topped profit and revenue expectations in the fourth quarter on strong demand during the crucial holiday period.",
      "Delta said Friday that travel demand picked up throughout the quarter. During November and December, the airline said that it saw four of the top 10 revenue days in its history and double-digit growth in cash bookings driven by both leisure and corporate travelers.",
      "\u201cAs we move into 2025, we expect strong demand for travel to continue, with consumers increasingly seeking the premium products and experiences that Delta provides,\u201d CEO Ed Bastian said in a prepared statement on Friday.",
      "The company earned $843 million, or $1.29 per share. Per share earnings removing one-time expenses were $1.85, easily beating Wall Street projections of $1.76, according to industry analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.",
      "A year earlier, Delta earned $2.04 billion, or $3.16 per share.",
      "Delta hit the top end of its own forecast for the three months ended Dec. 3, having said that it would earn between $1.60 and $1.85 per share.",

      "Total revenue per available seat mile climbed to $21.60 from $20.78 a year ago.",
      "Delta also benefited from a drop in fuel costs during the quarter. Fuel expense fell to $2.41 billion from $2.94 billion. The average fuel price per gallon declined to $2.36 from $3.01.",
      "Shares of Delta jumped more than 6% before the opening bell on Friday after saying that it now anticipates full-year earnings will be more than $7.35 per share, and between 70 cents and $1 in the first quarter.",
      "Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting full-year earnings of $6.11 per share and first-quarter earnings of 77 cents per share.",

      "Among U.S. carriers, Delta scored the highest for on-time arrivals last year, aviation-data provider Cirium reported last week. That was despite a computer outage that caused thousands of flight cancellations in July.",
      "Delta, based in Atlanta, achieved an on-time rate of more than 83%, good enough to rank third worldwide behind Aeromexico and Saudia, respectively. The next-best U.S. carriers were United Airlines, at nearly 81%, and Alaska Airlines, at just over 79%, Cirium said.",

    "story": [
      "Federal investigators have found in a report that a large South Carolina jail vastly underreports the violence behind its walls, lets dozens of inmates go unsupervised for long periods and lets crimes against prisoners go unpunished",
      "COLUMBIA, S,C. -- Federal investigators found in a scathing report this week that a large jail in South Carolina vastly underreports the violence occurring behind its walls and lets dozens of inmates go unsupervised for so long that at least two killings of prisoners were reported to jail staff from outside callers.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice told the jail in Richland County, which includes South Carolina's capital of Columbia, that it must improve conditions as soon as possible \u2014 repairing holes in walls, fixing locks that don't lock at all and fixing broken light fixtures that otherwise might be turned into weapons.",
      "The jail also must stop the flow of contraband, it said. Cellphones are used to orchestrate gang beatings even as inmates are moved from one wing to another for safety. Drugs brought into the facility caused eight prisoners to overdose in two months last year, according to the report released Wednesday by federal investigators.",
      "The 36-page report is filled with stunning details and damning facts.",
      "Named the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center, for a guard killed by inmates during an escape attempt in 2000, the jail has more openings for guards than the current number of actual officers, the report said. It added that hours go by without a single employee checking on jail wings and keys have gone unaccounted for.",
      "According to the report, the jail has four times as many assaults as the Miami-Dade jail even though the south Florida jail has four times as many inmates. It also said a private company that helps with security has hired people with felony convictions.",
      "The report also details stories about people charged but not convicted of crimes and waiting in jail for their trials.",
      "One inmate who has been at the jail for three years was beaten and stabbed and the jail took no action until his mother called them two days later, the report said. It added he was beaten again and a guard only responded when other prisoners reported he was bleeding. He was attacked a third time by four inmates and then a fourth time by seven prisoners only receiving help when an inmate called the central command center and reported him bleeding and crying, the report indicated.",
      "The report said on two occasions jail officials only learned of inmate killings from outsider callers: Once, someone left a message with the jail director that an inmate was dead in a pool of blood. A second time, a jail nurse got a call from someone outside who watched the killing on Facebook Live, according to the report.",
      "\u201cIndividuals who are charged with a crime and detained at Alvin S. Glenn face very real possibilities of being stabbed, raped and beaten before they ever see a courtroom. Such conditions violates the U.S. Constitution,\" U.S. Attorney Adair Boroughs said.",
      "Richland County officials didn't respond to messages seeking comment. Boroughs noted the county began repairs on the jail and started overhauling procedures and staffing after the investigation was announced more than a year ago. She urged them to keep up the work or the federal government would file suit.",
      "The report said criminal conduct in the jail often goes unpunished.",
      "\u201cWe found multiple, multiple incidents where crime scenes were cleaned up by inmates before the sheriff's office was ever notified \u2014 or perhaps they were never notified,\u201d Boroughs said at a news conference.",
      "The federal government continues to investigate the jail in Charleston County and has a court order against the Department of Juvenile Justice prisons in the state. In all, more than a dozen jails and prisons across the U.S. are under federal investigations or court orders.",
      "According to the report, an inmate told of being raped and genetic material found on his back matched another inmate. But it said there was no record of any further investigation being conducted.",
      "Another inmate threatened to commit suicide to get moved out of one unit where he reported a rape. In the next unit, he was raped again after he couldn't get a relative outside to pay $200 to the prisoner who attacked him, according to the report.",
      "The report has four pages of requirements for the jail.",
      "It said the jail needs to have at least one guard on each wing at all times and a second guard who walks between two wings. The jail also needs to stop requiring inmates to file grievances with an officer assigned to their unit.",
      "The jail also needs to do full searches of all employees for contraband, the report advised, adding workers were bringing illegal items into the prison in lunch coolers and under food containers.",
      "\"Corrections officers have a duty to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners, for being violently assaulted in prison is simply not part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society,\" the investigators wrote in their report."

      "Chris Wright, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for energy secretary, told senators during his confirmation hearing Wednesday that he would promote all sources of American energy, while also acknowledging the burning of fossil fuels causes climate change.",
      "Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has been one of the industry\u2019s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change. He believes that more fossil fuel production can lift people out of poverty around the globe. His nomination went before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for a confirmation hearing. Protesters interrupted it multiple times.",
      "Here are the most interesting moments:",
      "CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, Wright promised to help Trump \"unleash energy security and prosperity.\u201d",
      "The centerpiece of Trump\u2019s energy policy is \u201cdrill, baby, drill,\u201d and he has pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats\u2019 \u201cgreen new scam\u201d in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change \u2014 when they burn, greenhouse gases are released.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump shares my passion for energy,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAnd if confirmed, I will work tirelessly to implement his bold agenda as an unabashed steward for all sources of affordable, reliable and secure American energy.\u201d",
      "He said that includes oil and natural gas, which underpin the nation's economy; coal, nuclear power and hydropower as major sources of energy; rapidly-growing wind and solar power; and geothermal energy, which could become a meaningful source of energy.",
      "Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., called Wright an \u201cunrestrained enthusiast for fossils fuels in almost every regard,\u201d but noted that he studied nuclear, worked on solar energy and is a scientist who is open to discussion.",
      "Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said he thinks Wright's position on climate change is \u201cmore subtle than is publicly recognized\u201d and that he doesn't deny climate change is happening or that it's related to the combustion of fossil fuels, which are drastically increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.",
      "Wright responded \u201cabsolutely,\u201d adding that \u201cmostly from the combustion of hydrocarbons to enable our modern world, we\u2019ve increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by 50%,\u201d making it harder for the Earth to shed heat.",
      "Though he said climate change is real, he also said \u201cthere isn\u2019t dirty energy or clean energy.\u201d Rather, he said, there are different sources of energy with different tradeoffs.",
      "\u201cEnergy is critical to human lives. Climate change is a global challenge that we need to solve,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAnd tradeoffs between those two are the decisions politicians make and they're the decisions that will impact the future of our world and our quality of life.\u201d",
      "Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., asked Wright if he still believes that \u201cwildfires are just hype\u201d following the massive blazes in Southern California, which have killed at least 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes.",
      "Scientists say climate change means more frequent and intense wildfires, with drought-like conditions in the western U.S., are more likely.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve written that the hype over wildfires is just hype to justify more impoverishment from bad government policies,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cAnd given the devastation that we\u2019re currently experiencing in Los Angeles, do you still believe that wildfires are just hype?\u201d",
      "Wright said he stood by his past comments. He then said climate change is real before Padilla cut him off.",
      "Padilla said, \u201ctell that to the families of the more than two dozen lost in these fires and counting.\u201d",
      "One protester yelled \u201cLA is burning\u201d and another shouted \u201cI\u2019m 18 years old and I want a future!\u201d They held up signs that read, \u201cbig oil profits, LA burns.\u201d",
      "A disruption prompted the Republican Committee Chair, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, to briefly halt the hearing, saying the committee would stand in recess until the Capitol Police could restore order.",
      "Wright's company is an investor in Fervo Energy, a Houston-based geothermal company that makes electricity cleanly from the Earth's heat. He serves on the board of directors of Oklo, a developer of small modular nuclear reactors.",
      "Wright said he's excited about geothermal as an \u201can enormous, abundant energy resource below everyone\u2019s feet.\u201d Wright said he wants to accelerate the development of nuclear energy so it can meet a far greater share of the world's demand for electricity.",
      "Republican Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski asked Wright if he would support a proposed mega-gas project in her home state to export liquefied natural gas overseas. He said it's a \u201ctremendous idea\u201d and \u201cgreat for our country\u201d to grow natural gas production in Alaska and build infrastructure to export it.",
      "Wright said he will sever all ties across the energy industry if confirmed."

A statement from the agency said it\u2019s proposing to debar Andrew Clark for at least three years because he \u201cnot only supervised the unlawful conduct, he personally participated in it, driving some of the worst aspects of the boiler-room-style recruiting culture.\u201d",
      "The issue will be decided by the department's Office of Hearings and Appeals. A message was left with an attorney who represented Clark when he was at Zovio.",
      "The Biden administration previously said it would try to recoup money from the University of Arizona to offset the cancellation, saying the university inherited liability when it bought Ashford. That effort appears to have stalled, however, and it's unlikely to be picked up by the Trump administration, which is expected to be far friendlier to the for-profit college industry.",
      "Republicans in Congress have clashed with the Biden administration over student loan cancelation, saying it's a presidential overstep that puts the burden on taxpayers who didn't go to college. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., issued a report this month saying Biden \u201ctried to stretch every possible law\u201d and abused the borrower defense program to cancel loans.",
      "She took issue with the very practice used in the Ashford case \u2014 automatically canceling loans for big batches of borrowers even if they didn't apply for relief. When Trump takes office, Foxx wrote, \u201cthe jig will finally be up.\u201d",
      "This month Biden separately announced a final round of forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. With that action, the administration had provided loan relief to more than 5 million borrowers through a variety of existing programs, more than any other president.",
      "Still, Biden failed to deliver his promise for widespread student loan forgiveness. The Supreme Court blocked his plan to erase up to $20,000 for more than 40 million Americans, and a second attempt was tangled up in federal courts after several Republican states challenged it.",

      "Attorneys for the state of Florida argued before a federal appeals court Wednesday that a lower-court judge was wrong to block a law last year that bans gender-affirming care for minors and restricts similar care for adults, though a pending U.S. Supre...",
      "MIAMI -- Attorneys for the state of Florida argued before a federal appeals court Wednesday that a lower-court judge was wrong to block a law last year that bans gender-affirming care for minors and restricts similar care for adults, though a pending U.S. Supreme Court case creates uncertainty.",
      "Attorneys presented oral arguments before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Miami. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is already reviewing a similar ban in Tennessee, and the conservative court's ruling could affect laws in about two dozen other states.",
      "Florida's law prohibits transgender minors from being prescribed puberty blockers and hormonal treatments, even with their parents\u2019 permission. It also requires that transgender adults only receive treatment from a doctor and not from a registered nurse or other qualified medical practitioner. Adults who want the treatment must be in the room with the physician when signing the consent form.",
      "U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle had blocked the law in June, but a three-judge panel last fall stayed the lower court order against the ban while the matter is appealed, meaning the ban is currently being enforced.",
      "For minors, the only treatments at issue are puberty blocking treatments and cross-sex hormones \u2014 giving testosterone to someone assigned female at birth, for example. Those who were undergoing treatment when the law was adopted in May 2023 were allowed to continue. Surgery, which is rare for minors, was still blocked.",
      "As part of the state's appeal, attorney Mohammad Jazil told a three-judge appeals panel on Wednesday that Hinkle was wrong to conclude that the law was based on hostility from state officials and lawmakers against transgender people, rather than sound medical science.",
      "\u201cThe district court itself recognizes that there are concerns with this treatment, that guardrails are appropriate, stringent regulation is appropriate,\" Jazil said.",
      "The district judge was wrong to prioritize the views of a few lawmakers over the meritorious reasons to regulate treatment, Jazil said.",
      "\u201cThe district court relied on the statements of seven or so legislators to paint the entire Florida Legislature with a discriminatory animus towards transgender individuals and the two independent boards of medicine,\u201d Jazil said. \u201cAnd I think that that was wrong. That was an error.\u201d",
      "A group of Florida families, represented by GLAD Law and other civil rights groups, filed the initial lawsuit challenging the ban. They were later joined by four adult plaintiffs. Hinkle sided with the group, ruling that the ban is unconstitutional on equal protection grounds and motivated by purposeful discrimination against transgender people.",
      "Adam Unikowsky, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, told the judges Wednesday that Hinkle relied on more than just the statements of seven lawmakers.",
      "\u201cI think it considered that as one piece of circumstantial evidence in the overall evidentiary picture alongside other types of circumstantial evidence,\u201d Unikowsky said.",
      "As an example, Unikowsky referenced another Florida law, signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis the same day as the gender-affirming care restrictions, that prevents public school employees from using their preferred pronouns if they don't correspond to that employee's birth sex.",
      "\u201cAnd what the district court inferred from that was that the Legislature\u2019s goal was to deter people from transitioning,\u201d Unikowsky said. \u201cAnd it felt that it was hostile to the concept of people transitioning. It just didn\u2019t want people to do that.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court heard arguments in December on Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, though the justices\u2019 decision is not expected for several months. The case is being weighed by a conservative-dominated court after a presidential election in which Donald Trump and his allies promised to roll back protections for transgender people.",
      "Both attorneys at Wednesday's hearing were asked whether the appeals court should wait until the Supreme Court ruled before the lower court made a decision. Jazil said the appeal process should be paused because the Florida and Tennessee laws are so similar. Unikowsky said the Florida case should move forward because of differences in the legal arguments against both laws.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits. The states that have passed laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming."

      "Alexander Justin White, a U.S. citizen from Durham, is accused of providing, attempting and conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization by federal prosecutors.

Some of the content included IS and other Islamic extremist propaganda videos.",
      "During this period, federal prosecutors said White spoke to several social media users who claimed to be from the Middle East and North Africa about his support for IS. He told several users that he wished to travel to Africa to join IS as well, according to court documents. White also lamented missed opportunities to join the militant group in previous trips \u2014 such as in a 2018 visit to Egypt \u2014 in conversations online, authorities said.",
      "White also conversed frequently with a covert FBI agent over several months, which included several mentions of wanting to join IS and a staged video call that White believed was with an IS commander's spokesperson, prosecutors said.",
      "During text conversations with the agent, officials said White expressed his willingness to be a mujahid, the Arabic word for \u201choly warrior,\u201d and discussed fundraising for detained IS members and their family members.",
      "After several months of discussing his plans to travel abroad and join IS, White sent the agent a screenshot of his upcoming travel itinerary, which showed a Dec. 4 flight departing from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport to Rabat, Morocco, court records show.",
      "To not raise suspicions about the flight, White purchased a round-trip ticket, prosecutors said.",
      "White later arrived on Dec. 4 with three bags at RDU Airport, where he checked in for his connecting flight to Paris and proceeded through security, authorities said. He was then arrested a few hours later while attempting to board the plane.",
      "A federal public defender who was appointed to represent White declined to comment about the pending case on Wednesday.",

      "The federal government is withdrawing proposed rules that would have required more ships to slow down in East Coast waters to try to save a vanishing species of whale",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- The federal government is withdrawing a proposal that would require more ships to slow down in East Coast waters to try to save a vanishing species of whale, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The move in the waning days of the Biden administration will leave the endangered North Atlantic right whale vulnerable to extinction as the Trump administration is signaling a shift from environmental conservation to support for marine industries, conservation groups said. But federal authorities said there's no way to implement the rules before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Monday.",
      "The new vessel speed rules proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service more than two years ago have been the topic of much debate among shippers, commercial fishermen and wildlife conservationists, who all have a stake in the whale's fate. The whale, which is vulnerable to collisions with ships, numbers less than 380 and its population has plummeted in recent years.",
      "The Trump administration is likely to be less enthusiastic about new restrictions on shipping, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "\u201cWhile we\u2019ve been waiting and watching the proposed rule move forward, and ultimately stall, we\u2019ve watched on the water outcomes of the current insufficient protections,\u201d Brogan said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve watched whales be killed by speeding boats.\u201d",
      "The proposed rules would have expanded slow zones off the East Coast as well as the size classes of boats and ships that must slow down.",
      "The fisheries service received about 90,000 public comments about them, according to documents set to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday. The filing says the service \"does not have sufficient time to finalize this regulation in this administration due to the scope and volume of public comments.\"",
      "The final rule to modify North Atlantic right whale vessel speed regulations had been with the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews new regulations before they are implemented, said Katherine Silverstein, a spokesperson for the National Marine Fisheries Service. She confirmed the fisheries service withdrew the rule on Wednesday.",
      "Conservation groups have long argued that tighter ship speed rules are necessary to protect the whales, in part because warm ocean waters appear to be causing the animals to stray from protected zones. The federal government first announced the proposal in summer 2022 and a coalition of environmental groups sued to try to speed up the finalization of the rules last year.",
      "Some shippers, however, have argued that the rules could be economically devastating to boating and shipping industries.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge step forward for American boat manufacturers, coastal economies, and outdoor enthusiasts across the U.S.,\u201d said Frank Hugelmeyer, president and CEO of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the largest trade association in North America for the recreational boating industry. \u201cThe way this rule was drafted gave rulemaking a bad name and created an entirely preventable dynamic.\"",
      "Right whales were once numerous off the East Coast, but their numbers were devastated during the commercial whaling era. They have been a protected species for many years but have been slow to recover.",
      "The whales migrate from their calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. The journey has become increasingly perilous as the tiny organisms they eat seek colder waters, causing the whales to leave established protected areas, scientists have said.",
      "Conservation groups that have pushed for the finalization of the rules said they were motivated in part by documented collision deaths of right whales in recent years. In one much-publicized case last year, a calf stranded off the state of Georgia had head injuries consistent with a vessel strike, according to government investigators.",
      "The whales numbered more than 480 in 2010, but that fell by more than 25% over the following decade. It has ticked up slightly more recently, but the animal remains critically endangered. Vessel strikes are \u201ca leading cause of the species\u2019 decline,\u201d the National Marine Fisheries Service said in documents.",

      "Assistant U.S. attorney Francisco Navarro said the plea discussions with Zambada, a leader of Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel, haven't borne fruit so far, but prosecutors want to keep trying. A judge scheduled an April 22 hearing for an update.",
      "Zambada's lead attorney, Frank Perez, declined to comment on the discussions.",
      "It's common for prosecutors and defense lawyers to explore whether they can reach a deal, and the talks don't necessarily go anywhere.",
      "Zambada was an attentive and active participant during Wednesday's hearing, which focused on whether he wanted Perez to continue representing him even while also representing a potential government witness in the case \u2014 Zambada's son Vicente Zambada.",
      "\u201cI don't want a different attorney,\u201d the father said through a court interpreter. \u201cI want him, even though this could be a conflict if he represents me and my son.\u201d",
      "The younger Zambada was charged himself and made a plea deal in the long-running and sprawling U.S. prosecutions of Sinaloa cartel figures. He testified for the government at the trial of the cartel's infamous and now imprisoned co-founder, Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n.",
      "Working alongside Guzm\u00e1n, Ismael Zambada kept a lower profile and was seen as concentrating more on the business of smuggling than the extremes of brutality, serving as a strategist and dealmaker who engaged with day-to-day operations, authorities say.",
      "At Guzm\u00e1n's trial, Vicente Zambada recounted how his father and Guzm\u00e1n ran the cartel together. At one point, he described corrupt Mexican politicians asking whether the syndicate could help them ship 100 tons of cocaine in an oil tanker.",
      "\u201cThey wanted to know if my dad and Chapo could provide that amount of coke,\u201d he told a jury in the same Brooklyn federal courthouse where his father is being prosecuted. At another point, Vicente Zambada recalled hearing a rival drug gang leader say he wanted to kill Ismael Zambada and Guzm\u00e1n to avenge a botched hit.",
      "Prosecutors said in a court document last month that the son might be called to testify against his father, which could pose a conflict of interest for Perez. For instance, he'd be hindered in cross-examining the son because of the loyalty he owes both clients.",
      "Defense lawyers do sometimes have potential conflicts of interest regarding a client, and federal courts have outlined the steps judges should take to address such situations. Among them is having an independent lawyer advise defendants as they consider what to do about the possible conflict. Zambada had one at Wednesday's hearing.",
      "Zambada said he realized there could be problems with Perez representing him and his son \u2014 \u201cfor example, that he will have to hide information that he obtained from Vicente from me.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan ultimately agreed that Perez could stay on the case, noting that Ismael Zambada also has other lawyers who could handle any piece of it relating to his son.",
      "Law enforcement sought the elder Zambada for years before his startling arrest in July at an airport near El Paso, Texas, after arriving in a private plane with one of Guzm\u00e1n's sons, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez. He, too, was wanted by U.S. authorities.",
      "Zambada has said he was kidnapped in Mexico and hauled to the U.S. by Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, whose lawyer denies those claims. Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and his brother Ovidio are in plea negotiations with the U.S. government, their lawyers said this month in a Chicago courtroom.",
      "Following the July arrests and Zambada's allegations of kidnapping, horrific fighting erupted in Mexico between a cartel faction loyal to him and another tied to the \u201cChapitos,\" Guzm\u00e1n's sons. The chain of events also strained relations between Mexico and the United States.",
      "First, Mexico's president at the time, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and current President Claudia Sheinbaum laid part of the blame for the bloodshed at Washington's feet, saying the U.S. arrests uncorked trouble.",
      "The outgoing U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, responded that it was \u201cincomprehensible\u201d to suggest the cartel wars were Washington's fault. He subsequently asserted that the Mexican government had stopped cooperating with Washington on fighting cartels and was sticking its head in the sand about violence and police corruption.",
      "Mexico's foreign ministry reacted by expressing \u201csurprise\u201d in a formal note to the U.S. embassy about the envoy's statement."

    "summary": "Democrats have asked the Minnesota Supreme Court to intervene in a partisan power struggle that has roiled the start of the 2025 legislative session",
    "story": [
      "Democrats have asked the Minnesota Supreme Court to intervene in a partisan power struggle that has roiled the start of the 2025 legislative session",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon and House Democrats have asked the state's highest court to intervene in a partisan power struggle that has roiled the start of the 2025 legislative session.",
      "Simon, a Democrat, petitioned the Minnesota Supreme Court late Tuesday to declare that he legally remains the presiding officer in the Minnesota House, for now, and that Tuesday's election of GOP leader Lisa Demuth as speaker was invalid. He asked the court to back his position that 68 members are needed for the quorum that must show up for the chamber to take any official actions.",
      "\u201cBecause the members of the House lacked this constitutionally required quorum on January 14, Representative Demuth has not properly been elected speaker and the House cannot transact business,\u201d Simon\u2019s lawyers wrote. \u201cUntil a quorum is present and a speaker is properly elected, the Secretary remains the House\u2019s presiding officer and his role may not be usurped.\u201d",
      "House Democrats boycotted the opening day of the session in an effort to deny Republicans a quorum and block them from exploiting a temporary one-vote majority to unseat one Democrat and to advance the GOP agenda.",
      "Democrats also petitioned the Supreme Court late Tuesday, asking the high court to prohibit Republican lawmakers from conducting any business until at least 68 members are present, and declare than any actions taken in the meantime are \u201cwithout lawful authority and are therefore null and void.\u201d",
      "Demuth called the lawsuits an attack on the constitutional separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches.",
      "\u201cSecretary Simon has no authority as a member of the executive branch over proceedings in the House, and his role is strictly ceremonial in nature,\u201d Demuth said in a statement.",
      "House Republicans planned to convene a floor session at noon Wednesday, even as Democrats planned to continue the boycott for a second day. Republicans contend that only 67 members are needed for a quorum because one seat is empty.",
      "The November election resulted in a House tied at 67-67, and top leaders from both parties started to work out a power-sharing agreement on the assumption that they would be evenly split this year. But a judge late last month declared that a newly elected Democrat didn\u2019t really live in his district. That gave Republicans a temporary 67-66 majority until a special election can take place Jan. 28. Since the district is heavily Democratic, the election is expected to restore the tie.",
      "Democrats are especially worried because Republicans have threatened to use their two-week majority to refuse to seat Democratic Rep. Brad Tabke, of Shakopee. He won by only 14 votes in a different race, where local officials said 20 ballots were accidentally destroyed without being counted. A court declared Tabke the legal winner and rejected a GOP effort to force a special election in his swing district.",
      "Efforts to revive a power-sharing deal failed. The top House Democrat, Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, said at a news conference Tuesday that Demuth would not commit in final negotiations to letting Tabke keep his seat, even though she offered a deal that would have allowed Demuth to serve as speaker all session.",
      "State law says the secretary of state shall call the House to order at the start of a legislative session and preside until a speaker is elected. But the Democratic side of the chamber was empty when Simon convened the body.",
      "After a clerk took attendance and only the 67 GOP members answered \u201cpresent,\u201d Simon declared that they lacked a quorum of 68 and adjourned. But Republicans stayed in their seats and elected Demuth as speaker \u2014 a move that Democrats denounced as an \u201cunlawful sham with no legal authority.\u201d",
      "This is the first time the Minnesota Legislature has faced such a boycott, but similar stalling tactics have been used in other states.",
      "In contrast to the House, the Minnesota Senate convened calmly Tuesday. The Senate is tied 33-33 pending a Jan. 28 special election to fill the seat of a deceased senator. That\u2019s expected to restore the Democrats\u2019 34-33 majority. But Senate leaders quietly reached a power-sharing deal that includes co-presiding officers from both parties."

      "Two Georgia voter advocacy groups founded by Democrat Stacey Abrams and led by Raphael Warnock before he was elected to the U.S. Senate have admitted to campaign finance violations and will pay a $300,000 fine",
      "ATLANTA -- The Georgia Ethics Commission on Wednesday fined two advocacy groups that were founded by Democrat Stacey Abrams and led by Raphael Warnock before voters elected him to the U.S. Senate.",
      "The commission found that the New Georgia Project and its affiliated New Georgia Project Action Fund illegally did election work for Abrams and others without disclosing their campaign contributions and spending.",
      "The groups' current leadership admitted illegal activity in a consent decree and will pay a $300,000 fine, the largest in state history according to the commission's director, David Emadi.",
      "The commission found that the entities raised $4.2 million and spent $3.2 million to support Abrams and other candidates in the 2018 election cycle.",
      "Where ethics officials ruled the groups went wrong was failing to register as an independent campaign committee before taking contributions for electioneering, and failing to file campaign finance reports of contributions and spending before Abrams narrowly lost the governor\u2019s race to Republican Brian Kemp that year.",
      "Abrams founded the New Georgia Project in 2013 to register more nonwhite and young voters in Georgia and to urge them to turn out. The project is a charity that can accept tax-deductible donations. The New Georgia Project Action Fund is a nonprofit social welfare organization that can directly endorse candidates, although donations aren't tax deductible. Neither group normally has to disclose donors.",
      "Abrams stepped down in 2017 and said she had no role with the groups thereafter. Warnock, a close Abrams ally and Baptist minister, was listed as the New Georgia Project's CEO on corporate filings in 2017, 2018, and 2019.",
      "The groups repeated the same illegal activity in 2019 when they campaigned to extend public transportation in suburban Gwinnett County, failing to disclose $646,000 in contributions and $174,000 in spending for voter referendum to join the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority. The referendum lost.",
      "Michael Brewer, a spokesperson for Warnock\u2019s Senate office, said Warnock was working \u201cas a longtime champion for voting rights\u201d and didn\u2019t know anything about violations. \"Compliance decisions were not a part of that work,\u201d Brewer wrote in an email.",
      "The complaint was filed in 2019 and eventually survived court challenges, accessing emails in an effort to prove that the groups improperly coordinated with Abrams' 2018 campaign. Wednesday's consent decree contains no such findings.",
      "Lawyers for the New Georgia Project previously argued that the groups acted like other nonprofits and that Republicans including Emadi, who had donated to Kemp, were using their majority on the commission in a partisan witch hunt to damage Abrams' political viability.",
      "Abrams lost the 2022 governor's race to Kemp by a much larger margin than in 2018, but the ethics case was little discussed.",
      "The commission fined another group, Gente4Abrams, $50,000 in 2020 for failing to register and file reports on $240,000 it spent to help Abrams in the 2018 Democratic primary, the commission found. The group registered after the commission ruling, reporting it spent an additional $685,000 for Abrams in the 2018 general election."

      "The Congressional Budget Office has shrunk its projections for the U.S. population in 30 years to 372 million residents, a 2.8% drop from last year, citing declining birth rates and less expected immigration.",
      "The budget office last year projected 383 million people living in the United States in 30 years but reduced that figure by 11 million residents in projections released this week. The U.S. had an estimated 341 million residents on New Years' Day and is expected to grow to 350 million people by year's end.",
      "Population growth will slow over the next three decades. In the next 10 years, the yearly growth rate in the United States will be on average, 0.4% but then it slows down on average to 0.1% between 2036 and 2055, the budget office said.",
      "The overall yearly growth rate over the next three decades, 0.2%, is projected to be less than a quarter of what it was from 1975 to 2024.",
      "Without immigration, the U.S. population will shrink starting in 2033 in part \u201cbecause fertility rates are projected to remain too low for a generation to replace itself,\u201d the Congressional Budget Office said.",
      "The reduced projections from last year were the results of a decline in projected fertility rates over 30 years from 1.70 births per woman to 1.60 births per woman and less immigration because of an executive order last June that temporarily suspends asylum processing at the border when U.S. officials deem they are overwhelmed, the budget office said. Replacement happens at a rate of 2.1 births per woman.",

      "The Congressional Budget Office's projections are higher than those made by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau counts the resident population, while the CBO projects includes the resident population as well as U.S. citizens and others living abroad who are eligible for those benefits.

      "Presidential inaugurations are deeply rooted in American history",
      "WASHINGTON -- Presidential inaugurations are deeply rooted in American history. The customs and festivities, like the parade and galas, bring spectacle to the nation\u2019s capital. But the date and oath of office are prescribed in the Constitution.",
      "In this episode of \u201cThe Story Behind the AP Story,\u201d hear from AP Washington radio correspondent Sagar Meghani and White House correspondent Darlene Superville as they share their past inauguration experiences and peel back the curtain on what we can expect during Donald Trump's presidential inauguration on Monday.",
      "Haya Panjwani, Host: Every four years on January 20th, Washington, D.C., braces for the start of a new presidency.",
      "Sagar Meghani, AP Washington radio correspondent: The part that\u2019s fascinating to me is that the Constitution only prescribes two things for an inauguration: It\u2019s the date and it\u2019s the oath that the incoming president has to recite.",
      "PANJWANI: President-elect Donald Trump is expected to take the oath of office in 2025 for his second presidential term. I\u2019m Haya Panjwani. Today I\u2019ll be speaking with AP Washington radio correspondent Sagar Meghani and White House correspondent Darlene Superville. They\u2019ll help us peel back the curtain and share what we can expect during a presidential inauguration.",
      "Darlene Superville, AP White House correspondent: For people watching from home and even for people who are on the (National) Mall or at the Capitol for the ceremony itself, it\u2019s probably one of the oldest traditions in the United States. It\u2019s symbolic of the peaceful transfer of power, which we\u2019ve been hearing so much about these last couple of years, four or five years or so. There\u2019s a lot of pomp and pageantry associated with inaugurations, seeing one president depart and end his term and a new president coming in and taking over the reins of government.",
      "MEGHANI: The presidents perhaps riding together to the Capitol, to seeing former presidents there watching one of their successors take the oath of office, the luncheon that they have, and then the parade after that. And, presidents getting out and walking down from the Capitol toward the White House. It\u2019s so steeped in tradition from when George Washington first took that oath in 1789. We complain about it being cold and a very long day with a lot of security in Washington. I\u2019ve gotten to be at four of them. It remains fascinating to watch how it all plays out.",
      "PANJWANI: Darlene and Sager have covered their fair share of inaugurations, and one thing is consistent: the cold.",
      "SUPERVILLE: The one inauguration that sticks most vividly in my mind was 2009, when Barack Obama was inaugurated president. He became the country\u2019s first ever Black president. It was super cold outside that January day, and my assignment was to be up on the lawn of the Capitol, the west front of the Capitol, which is where all the guests traditionally sit to watch the ceremony, which takes place on the west front. And so, you\u2019re out there kind of roaming around looking for color, looking for celebrities, looking for faces that you recognize that you can, and any interesting things that are happening that you can contribute to the reporting. I just remember it being so cold. I usually don\u2019t wear a hat. So when you do see me wearing a hat, you know it\u2019s cold.",
      "MEGHANI: Yeah, I was right there with Darlene on the west front as well. It was the first time that the AP did a live video show, a streaming show with the inauguration. So I was one of the two co-hosts. I was standing on metal bleachers with a local government professor for several hours just kind of watching. And in the awaiting the pageantry, as Darlene said, it\u2019s fun to look down on to that set-up on the west front and watch the dignitaries come in, whether it\u2019s the former presidents, whether it\u2019s Supreme Court justices or notable lawmakers. And as Darlene said, very, very, very cold and windy that day, especially when you\u2019re standing on metal bleachers for several hours at a time.",
      "PANJWANI: This isn\u2019t Donald Trump\u2019s first time being inaugurated.",
      "Donald Trump: I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear that I will \u2026 .",
      "MEGHANI: The first Donald Trump inauguration back in 2017, it started out like so many of the others have. He went to the White House, where he was greeted by the outgoing first family. Barack and Michelle Obama were there. They rode to the Capitol, and from there, it all took a bit of a turn.",
      "It was just, it was a darker mood, if you will. And Donald Trump\u2019s speech, what became known as the American Carnage speech, talking about moms and kids in inner-city poverty and rusted-out factories around the American landscape looking like tombstones. That\u2019s what it became remembered for. The Trump team wanted it to be remembered for his main message, which was that that was the day that power was taken from the ruling class in Washington and was given back to the American people.",
      "PANJWANI: The inauguration Americans watched four years ago was different to inaugurations in the past, since the world was still in the midst of a pandemic.",
      "SUPERVILLE: There were no people on the National Mall or sitting on the lawn of the Capitol to watch the ceremony itself. In place of real people, President Biden\u2019s inaugural team had stuck many American flags into the lawn, and that was supposed to signify the people\u2019s presence. The parade was truncated. There were no inaugural balls, and all of this was playing to the COVID situation and the fears of people being too close to one another and getting people sick.",
      "MEGHANI: The other thing we did not see four years ago was that tradition of the outgoing president greeting the incoming president. Donald Trump had already left the White House and was heading back to Florida. So he was not at the White House with Melania Trump to greet Joe and Jill Biden, and he became the first sitting president since Andrew Johnson back in 1869, who skipped town before U.S. Grant was inaugurated.",
      "PANJWANI: This time, we can expect some return to normalcy.",
      "SUPERVILLE: The mall, packed with people coming out to watch this transfer of power. The president and first lady, the new president and the new first lady dancing the night away at a minimum of a dozen or so balls. We might even see President Trump walking a little bit of the parade route between the Capitol on the way to the White House. So there is lots of pageantry and showmanship and coming together, if you will, that I would expect to see this time around that we didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t get to see four years ago because of the COVID situation. President Joe Biden has already said that he intends to attend the inauguration, which is a courtesy that Donald Trump did not extend to him in 2021. And I would fully expect that incoming President Trump to participate in the traditions this time around because he was the victor in November.",
      "SUPERVILLE: And some people may wonder, how do they move in one president and move out the other president. And so a lot of that happens behind the White House on the South Lawn. There are moving trucks for both families. The resident staff is quickly moving out the belongings of the outgoing president and quickly moving in all the belongings of the incoming president so that when they finally do leave the reviewing stand and they come in to freshen up before they have to go out for the evening, most, if not all, of their belongings are in place in drawers, in rooms where they have directed that those things go.",
      "MEGHANI: Another fun part is trying to anticipate when exactly the limo will stop and the Secret Service will once again surround it. And the new president and the new first lady will actually step out onto Pennsylvania Avenue and walk along and wave to the crowd. The first inaugural that I covered in 2005, I was one of the reporters who was on a flatbed truck directly behind the presidential limousine, just so you could have that view and kind of narrate what the crowds were like. In this case, it was smack in the middle of the Iraq war. There were a lot of protesters, a lot of yelling at the limousine as President (George W.) Bush drove by for his second inauguration. And that, again, that moment when they actually step out and wave to the public and walk, that moment did not happen with Jimmy Carter because he decided to walk the entire route from the Capitol all the way to the White House, had not happened before. That has not happened since.",
      "PANJWANI: Darlene and Sager, whether they working out of the AP office or on Capitol Hill, plan to be prepared.",
      "SUPERVILLE: One of the ways that we cover this a lot is we\u2019re in the bureau, all the TVs are tuned to the ceremony and we\u2019re watching and taking notes and writing down color and writing our stories based off what we\u2019re seeing on TV, as well as the incoming feeds that our people on the ground are sending in to us. So I\u2019ll be doing one of those things, but I just don\u2019t know yet. But the other thing I would say is that as a reporter going out there, I probably would not have a purse or a bag with me. I would probably just stuff my pockets with all the things that I need. My hand warmers, my pens, my external battery, my cords, my phone, earmuffs. You have it because having a bag can delay in some ways. It can delay you with security and all the security precautions that are going to be in town.",
      "MEGHANI: You end up looking a bit like when you see a little kid wearing a puffy winter coat and they look like they\u2019re just kind of rolling along like the Michelin man. You\u2019re trying to cram as much as you can. Like Darlene said, things to keep you warm, a bottle of water, some snacks, pens, notebooks, chargers, batteries. Exactly. So whatever you think you\u2019re going to need for seven, eight, nine, 10 hours because of all that security and how early we would have to be in place for something. You want to make sure you\u2019re self-sufficient.",

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin didn't inform Congress or the White House as required when he was incapacitated due to treatment for prostate cancer or when complications worsened his condition last year",
      "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did not inform Congress or the White House as required when he was incapacitated due to treatment for prostate cancer or when complications worsened his condition last year, the Pentagon's watchdog concluded in a highly critical report released Wednesday.",
      "The inspector general's report faults Austin for the communications failures early last year in which he kept his hospitalization secret for days, even from President Joe Biden. The inspector general found that his strong desire for privacy likely influenced his staff in deciding not to prod further into his condition.",
      "In one example, he directed his staff that if anyone had questions, \u201cyou're more than welcome to ask (me) directly\u201d \u2014 likely chilling further inquiry, the report said.",
      "Austin did not inform either Congress or the White House of his initial treatment in December 2023 for prostate cancer or tell his staff or the White House of his worsening complications on Jan. 1, 2024, which led him to be taken by ambulance to Walter Reed Army National Military Medical Center.",
      "\"No one on Secretary Austin\u2019s staff knew the seriousness of his condition, including when his condition became worse and he was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) the following day,\" the report said.",
      "The report, signed by inspector general Robert Storch, comes just four days before Austin leaves the job and President-elect Donald Trump takes office. It provides new details on communications between Austin and members of his staff, but no real bombshells about the stunning lapse.",
      "The findings mirror much of the criticism in an internal review done about a month after Austin was admitted to Walter Reed. That internal review, done by Austin\u2019s subordinates, largely absolved anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding his hospitalization. And it said flatly there was \u201cno indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.\u201d",
      "Although he transferred decision-making authorities to Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks during his initial surgery and then again when he was in intensive care, he did not tell her why and he did not inform the White House.",
      "The incident angered the White House and infuriated members of Congress, who called him to Capitol Hill for a hearing, where he faced bipartisan criticism and and demands that someone should have been held accountable.",
      "Austin himself, in a lengthy press conference after he returned to work, largely took the blame. He told reporters that he never told his staff to keep his surgery and hospitalization secret from the White House, but acknowledged that he should have handled it differently and apologized for keeping Biden and others in the dark.",
      "Austin was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early December 2023 and went to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for surgery on Dec. 22. On Jan. 1, 2024, he was taken back to Walter Reed by ambulance after experiencing significant pain and was moved to the intensive care unit the next day.",
      "Pentagon officials have acknowledged that public affairs and defense aides were told on Jan. 2 that Austin had been hospitalized, but did not make it public and did not tell the military service leaders or the National Security Council until Jan. 4. Only then Biden find out. It took four more days before the reason for his hospitalization was disclosed.",
      "The internal review blamed privacy restrictions and staff hesitancy for their failure to quickly notify the president and other senior leaders about Austin\u2019s hospitalization. And it called for a number of procedural changes to improve communications and avoid similar problems in the future.",
      "The changes include better guidelines for the transfer of authorities and better reporting requirements during those incidents. And the White House also made changes in federal guidelines as a result of the incident."

      "Representatives from FEMA, the Small Business Administration, the state and several charities gathered to explain the process at a disaster recovery center at UCLA Research Park West and Pasadena City College Community Education Center.",
      "FEMA offers up to $770 to help cover the evacuees\u2019 immediate needs, but its larger grants generally aren\u2019t available until after insurance companies pay out. Someone who receives a maximum grant from FEMA might be eligible for another $10,000 grant from the state.",
      "For other needs beyond what insurance and FEMA cover, the Small Business Administration offers low-interest loans: Businesses can borrow up to $2 million, while homeowners can borrow up to $500,000 for rebuilding and another $100,000 for personal property.",

      "But the enormity of the destruction in Southern California has quickly snuffed out all festiveness in the movie industry\u2019s high season of celebration. At one point, the flames even encroached on the hillside above the Dolby Theatre, the home of the Academy Awards.",
      "The fires have struck at the very heart of a movie industry still trying to stabilize itself after years of pandemic, labor turmoil and technological upheaval. Not for the first time this decade, the Oscars are facing the question of: Should the show go on? And if it does, what do they mean now?",
      "The Oscars remain as scheduled, but it\u2019s certain that they will be transformed due to the wildfires, and that most of the red-carpet pomp that typically stretches between now and then will be curtailed if not altogether canceled.

      "Davies was moved by the little details of victims\u2019 stories \u2014 like the fact that someone lost their home just as they were bringing a baby home from the hospital \u2014 and compiled and circulated a list of GoFundMe sites, thinking others would feel the same and be spurred to donate.",

      "The outgoing acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center says the U.S. is facing an elevated threat of terrorism",
      "McLEAN, Va. -- Brett Holmgren got woken up early on New Year's Day by alerts that a driver had plowed into a crowd of revelers in New Orleans.",
      "The rampage, which killed 14 people, was the deadliest attack on U.S. soil in years and was inspired by the Islamic State group. The National Counterterrorism Center, which Holmgren leads, sprang into action to help the FBI run down information on the culprit from Texas and his plot.",
      "It was a rare recent example of a mass attack motivated by religious extremism to hit the U.S. homeland. But it didn't occur in a vacuum, coming at a time when a terror threat that has waxed and waned in the two decades since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks is decidedly on the rise around the world.",
      "\u201cWe are in a period where we are facing an elevated threat environment,\u201d Holmgren said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe faced that last year. We\u2019re going to face it again in 2025.\u201d",
      "The NCTC emerged in the aftermath of 9/11 as a centralized U.S. government hub to collect and analyze data and intelligence on the international terrorism threat, providing information to the White House and other agencies to shape policy decisions and protect against attacks.",
      "A former counterterrorism analyst and assistant secretary of state, Holmgren was named its acting director last July and intends to step aside at the conclusion of the Biden administration. At that point, new leadership under President-elect Donald Trump will grapple with managing some of the global hot spots like Syria that have vexed officials in recent months and that the NCTC has been tracking.",
      "Holmgren cites multiple factors for why the threat is higher than before, including passions arising from the Israel-Hamas war \u2014 a conflict that he says has been a driving factor in some 45 attacks worldwide since October 2023. He also points to mass migration from the Russia-Ukraine war that has sent central Asians, some with ties to the Islamic State group, to countries including Turkey, Syria, Iraq and even the U.S.",
      "Around the world, officials are monitoring tensions in Africa, which Holmgren called potentially the greatest long-term threat to U.S. security given that the Islamic State group has a large footprint on the continent and is investing resources there.",
      "He says the \u201cmost potent overseas threat facing the United States\u201d right now is the group's Afghanistan-based affiliate, known as Islamic State-Khorasan, whose attacks include a March 2024 massacre at a Moscow theater and the  August 2021 bombing that killed 13 U.S. service members and about 170 Afghans in the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
      "One ongoing spot of concern is Syria, where an insurgent group named Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, led a lightning offensive last month that toppled the government of President Bashar Assad.",
      "HTS is a Sunni Islamist group that formerly had ties with al-Qaida, although its leader has preached religious coexistence since taking over in Damascus. The group has not plotted against U.S. interests in recent years and has been \u201cthe most effective counterterrorism partner on the ground,\u201d Holmgren said.",
      "HTS has been designated by the State Department as a foreign terror organization, a label that carries severe sanctions.",
      "Asked whether that designation would remain, Holmgren said that was a policy decision, though he noted: \u201cThey want to be perceived as being on the right side of the international community at this time when it comes to (counterterrorism). But we will continue to evaluate not just their words but also the actions that they\u2019re undertaking.\u201d",
      "In an indication of Syria's continued instability, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told The Associated Press last week that the U.S. needs to keep troops there to prevent the Islamic State group from reconstituting, and intelligence officials in Syria\u2019s new de facto government already have thwarted a plan by IS to set off a bomb at a Shiite shrine in a Damascus suburb.",
      "U.S. officials, meanwhile, remain concerned about the possibility of IS gaining strength by taking over weapons left behind by Assad's government or through a mass release of fighters who are now imprisoned.",
      "\u201cA large-scale prisoner release in Syria could provide a real boost in the arm for IS at a time where they have been under significant pressure,\u201d Holmgren said.",
      "The counterterrorism center's focus is on international terrorism, which includes cases in the U.S. like the New Orleans rampage in which the attacker was inspired by a group from abroad. The culprit, 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, pledged his allegiance to IS in videos he recorded just before he drove his speeding pickup truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street early on Jan. 1.",
      "As of now, Holmgren said, there's no evidence that Jabbar was communicating with any IS operatives overseas or guided by anyone, but given that he was a lone actor who was radicalized, \u201cthis symbolizes exactly the type of attack that we\u2019ve warned about for some time.\"",
      "\u201cAnd I think it illustrates that while we have been quite effective as a government and across administrations at disrupting plotting overseas and going after terrorist leaders, we have a lot more work to do when it comes to countering violent extremism at home, countering violent extremist propaganda abroad,\" he added.",
      "\"That is ultimately what is going to be needed to prevent more attacks like the one in New Orleans,\u201d Holmgren said.",
      "By the same token, through vast intelligence collection, hardened defenses and overseas counterterrorism operations, the U.S. has made the risk of another large-scale attack like Sept. 11 lower than it's ever been.",
      "\u201cBut if we get complacent as a country,\u201d he warned, \u201cit will come back to bite us.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- As President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, Pam Bondi, prepares for questioning from senators on Wednesday, only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d confident that the Department of Justice will act in a fair and nonpartisan manner during his second term, a poll finds.",
      "Their faith in the neutrality of the FBI is similarly low, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which was conducted before the beginning of the confirmation hearings for Trump's Cabinet. Even some Republicans express uncertainty in the Justice Department and the FBI, suggesting that even once they take office, Trump and his allies may find it challenging to restore trust in the law enforcement agencies they've heavily criticized.",
      "Adding to the doubts about the incoming Trump administration, the poll also finds that Americans' views of several of his highest-profile nominees are more negative than positive, although many don\u2019t have an opinion about the people he\u2019s selected for his Cabinet.",
      "However, one of Trump's more controversial nominees, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is still broadly popular with Republicans, according to the poll. Kennedy, the scion of a Democratic dynasty and a prominent vaccine skeptic, has been tapped as top health official. His confirmation hearings have not been scheduled.",
      "Trump has selected loyalists to lead the Department of Justice and the FBI after threatening to retaliate against perceived adversaries. Relatively few Americans are confident that these agencies will act in a fair and impartial manner over the next four years, according to the poll.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident that the Justice Department and the FBI will act in a fair and nonpartisan manner during Trump\u2019s second term, while about one-third are \u201csomewhat\u201d confident and about 2 in 10 are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d confident.",
      "Even as a new GOP administration prepares to take control, Republicans are split on whether the DOJ and the FBI will remain neutral. Only about one-quarter of Republicans are at least \u201cvery\u201d confident that the agencies will behave in a nonpartisan way, while about 4 in 10 are \u201csomewhat\u201d confident and roughly one-third are \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident.",
      "Their uncertainty may reflect the fact that the nation\u2019s law enforcement agencies have been heavily criticized over the last few years by Trump and his allies, including by Bondi, the former Florida attorney general, and Kash Patel, his choice to lead the FBI. In one radio appearance, Bondi described special counsel Jack Smith, who who charged Trump in two federal cases, and other prosecutors who have charged Trump as \u201chorrible\u201d people she said were trying to make names for themselves by \u201cgoing after Donald Trump and weaponizing our legal system.\u201d",
      "Patel, meanwhile, has called for dramatic changes to the FBI, including reducing its footprint and authority.",
      "The poll finds that only about 2 in 10 Americans approve of Pete Hegseth\u2019s nomination as secretary of defense. He faced contentious confirmation hearings on Tuesday. A similarly small share say they \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cstrongly\u201d approve of Tulsi Gabbard being tapped to serve as intelligence chief and Patel being selected as FBI director. About one-third of Americans disapprove of each of the picks, while the rest either don\u2019t have an opinion or don\u2019t know enough to say.",
      "Many Republicans are on board with Trump\u2019s choice of Hegseth, Gabbard and Patel \u2014 about 4 in 10 approve of their nominations \u2014 although a significant chunk aren't familiar with the nominees or don't have an opinion.",
      "The poll also indicates that many Americans may be skeptical of Trump\u2019s strategy in selecting some Cabinet nominees, like Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel weekend host, who does not have a traditional track record in government. Only about one-quarter say that it would be a good thing for the president to rely on people without government experience for advice about government policy, while about half say it would be a bad thing and the rest say it wouldn\u2019t be good or bad.",
      "Republicans are more likely than Democrats or independents to say it's a good thing for the president to rely on people without government experience \u2014 about 4 in 10 say this, compared with about 2 in 10 independents and about 1 in 10 Democrats \u2014 while about 3 in 10 say it's neither good nor bad and about one-quarter say it's a bad thing.",
      "But not all of the nominees are unknown \u2014 and at least one has many fans in Trump's base. Kennedy, who has promised to overhaul the Department of Health and Human Services' staff, has broader name recognition than Hegseth, Gabbard or Patel, but Americans\u2019 feelings toward him are still more cold than warm. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cstrongly\u201d approve of Kennedy\u2019s nomination, while about 4 in 10 \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cstrongly\u201d disapprove, and the rest are neutral or don\u2019t know enough to say.",

      "On the third Monday of the month, federal, state and local governments, institutions and various industries recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day",
      "The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his iconic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech in 1963 on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. He chose that location in part to honor President Abraham Lincoln as \u201ca great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today.\u201d Now, millions of people honor King in the same way.",
      "On the third Monday of January \u2014 close to King's Jan. 15 birthday \u2014 federal, state and local governments, institutions and various industries recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day. For some, the holiday is just that \u2014 time off from work or school. But, King's family and others carrying on his legacy of equality, justice and non-violent protest want Americans to remember that this holiday is really about helping others.",
      "While it is now a time-honored tradition, the establishment of the holiday had a prolonged, difficult path to acceptance.",
      "The idea to establish a national holiday for the civil rights icon arose as the nation was plunged into grief. U.S. Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, one of the longest-serving members of Congress known for his liberal stance on civil rights, proposed legislation to recognize King four days after his assassination outside a motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968.",
      "Supporters knew it would not be easy. King, who was 39 years old at the time, was a polarizing figure to half the country even before his death, said Lerone Martin, director of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. Polls conducted by the Washington Post and the New York Times indicated most Americans did not trust King or thought he was too radical because of his speeches on poverty, housing and against the Vietnam War.",
      "\u201cPeople say that King is moving too fast after 1965 and basically \u2018Hey, you got the Voting Rights bill done. That\u2019s enough,'\u201d Martin said.",
      "The Congressional Black Caucus, founded by Conyers, tried to bring the legislation up for a vote for the next 15 years. Among the Republican rebuttals \u2014 public holidays don't apply to private citizens, King was a communist or King was a womanizer. In the meantime, his widow, Coretta Scott King, kept lobbying for it. Musician Stevie Wonder even released a song, \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d to rally support.",
      "So, what changed?",
      "By the 1980s, the social and cultural climate in the U.S. had shifted and the public was reflecting on racial progress, Martin said. Most Americans now were also regretting the Vietnam War. Supporters, meanwhile, were still calling for federal holiday status.",
      "In 1983, about 20 years after King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, legislation for a Martin Luther King Jr. Day on the third Monday of January cleared Congress and President Ronald Reagan signed it.",
      "Reagan's signing did not lead other Republicans to follow. It would be 17 more years until all 50 states observed it. Most of the foot-dragging came from the South \u2014 except for Arizona. Then in 1987, Gov. Evan Mecham rescinded his predecessor's executive order enacting a state holiday in Arizona.",
      "\u201cHe said \u2018Black people don\u2019t need a holiday. Y'all need jobs,'\u201d recalled Dr. Warren H. Stewart Sr., senior pastor at First Institutional Baptist Church in Phoenix. \u201cThat started the war.\u201d",
      "Stewart launched a group to lead \"people of all colors and all persuasions, faiths and parties\" in protest marches. Entertainers including Wonder canceled Arizona events. Companies moved conventions. The tipping point was the loss of hosting the Super Bowl. In 1992, Arizona became the first state where voter initiative reinstated the King holiday.",
      "Supporters took a victory lap the next MLK Day with a packed arena concert attended by Wonder and other artists. Even Rosa Parks was there. Stewart remembers speaking to the crowd.",
      "\u201cWhat I said there \u2014 and it still applies today \u2014 we've won the holiday but the holiday is a symbol of liberty and justice for all and we must move from symbol to substance,\u201d he said.",
      "South Carolina was the final holdout until 2000. But, it was without the backing of the civil rights groups because it also allowed for a Confederate Memorial Day.",
      "Martin Luther King Jr. Day's reach has only grown in its 42 years.",
      "It's the only federal holiday where you take a \u201cday on, not a day off.\" In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed into law Congressman John Lewis and Sen. Harris Wofford's legislation making it a National Day of Service.",
      "Just about every major city and suburb has some revelry the weekend before, including parades, street festivals and concerts. The various service projects run the gamut \u2014 community clean-up, packing food boxes, donating blood.",
      "AmeriCorps, the federal agency that deploys volunteers to serve communities around the nation, has distributed $1.5 million in grants to 200 nonprofits, faith-based groups and other organizations for projects. CEO Michael Smith estimates there have been hundreds of projects involving hundreds of thousands of people for MLK day in recent years. Engagement seems to be expanding.",
      "\u201cYou know, any given day I see another project that has nothing to do with us,\u201d said Smith, who has served in President Joe Biden's administration. \u201cWhat's so important about the King holiday is not only the service that's going to happen, but how it creates a spark for people to think about how maybe they're going to serve all year long.\u201d",
      "That's something King's daughter, the Rev. Bernice King and CEO of the King Center in Atlanta, desires as well. She wishes people would do more than \u201cquote King, which we love to do.\u201d They need to do good work and commit daily \u201cto embrace the spirit of nonviolence.\u201d",
      "Martin also thinks it's important to learn about the man himself. He finds excitement in seeing people read or hear about the Nobel Peace Prize winner. But, nothing compares to taking in King's own writings such as his 1963 \u201cLetter from the Birmingham Jail,\" he added.",

      "The first of multiple sexual assault trials is to begin for a man whose arrest more than five years ago thrust allegations of widespread abuse at New Hampshire\u2019s state-run youth detention center into the public eye",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- The first of multiple sexual assault trials starts Wednesday for a man whose arrest more than five years ago thrust allegations of widespread abuse at New Hampshire\u2019s state-run youth detention center into the public eye.",
      "Former youth counselor Stephen Murphy, 55, of Danvers, Massachusetts, faces 16 charges involving four boys held at the Youth Development Center in Manchester in the late 1990s. In the current case, he faces one charge of aggravated felonious sexual assault alleging that he raped a boy in a stairwell while several coworkers restrained the teen.",
      "Murphy's accuser, Michael Gilpatrick, already has testified twice about the allegations \u2014 first at a civil trial involving another former youth center resident and again at a criminal trial for Brad Asbury, the man he said held him down. He described Murphy, Asbury and the others as a \u201chit squad\u201d who regularly terrorized children.",
      "\u201cThe four of them used to roll together,\u201d he had testified. \u201cThey would literally come over and just go door to door and beat every single one of us, down the line.\u201d",
      "Asbury, 70, was convicted in November of two counts of being an accomplice to aggravated sexual assault, and prosecutors listed him as a potential witness against Murphy, who has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Murphy and another former employee were arrested in July 2019 and charged with sexually assaulting David Meehan, who later became the first of more than 1,100 former residents who have sued the state alleging physical, sexual or emotional abuse spanning six decades.",
      "Murphy's attorney, Charles Keefe, did not return a phone call Tuesday, but a former attorney said he has denied the allegations involving Meehan and \u201canything like them regarding anybody no matter who the accuser might be or when it took place.\u201d",
      "Concurrent with Murphy's arrest, the attorney general\u2019s office launched a broad investigation into the facility, now called the Sununu Youth Services Center. A total of 11 men have been arrested, though charges against one were dropped due to a lack of evidence, another was found incompetent to stand trial and a third died awaiting trial. Murphy is the fourth to go to trial.",

    "summary": "The marginal dip in UK inflation is unusually important and offers some respite to the chancellor.",
    "story": [
      "A marginal dip in the headline rate of inflation would not normally determine much, if anything.",
      "Inflation rising at 2.5% rather than 2.6% does not change much in big economics, nor in the cost of living squeeze felt by households. The fall is entirely accounted for by falls in hotel prices and a smaller-than-usual rise in airfares in December.",
      "But this unusually important 0.1% drop signals relief, and some respite for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, because of what underpins it.",
      "The underlying inflation numbers, which show where price pressures are going over the year, are what is most keenly watched by the Bank of England in terms of interest rate cuts.",
      "Core inflation, which strips out the direct impact of volatile energy and food prices is now at a four-year low, having dropped to 3.2% in December from 3.5%. Services inflation is at a two-year low of 4.4% after a chunky fall from 5%. This is the real positive news.",
      "For the real nerds, inflation in supply chains, including in services, also indicates muted inflationary pressures.",
      "So the inflationary picture in the UK can be cast in a rather different light. While no-one can predict exactly how the Bank of England will react, it clears away objections to an interest rate cut next month. The markets scrambled this morning to keep up, now back forecasting further rate cuts after February this year.",
      "UK inflation unexpectedly dips to 2.5% in December",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "However, there are two big uncertainties \u2013 whether President-elect Trump will bring in tariffs at the scale he has threatened, and how companies in the UK react to the forthcoming increase in National Insurance Contributions (NICs) in April and the rise in the minimum wage. A rise in energy prices which will hit bills is also predicted for April.",
      "Both tariffs and the forthcoming changes to NICs and the minimum wage may not end up being as problematic for the UK economy as some are warning.",
      "While some are expecting firms to raise prices as a result of the Budget changes, some companies may also choose to squeeze wages with lower-than-expected annual wage increases. The overall inflationary impact depends on how firms react and the truth is we don't know yet.",
      "Similarly Trump's tariffs are likely to be inflationary for the US and therefore affect US interest rates. But some at the Bank of England can see a scenario where cheaper tariff imports, for example from China, are diverted to the UK helping to rein in UK inflation.",
      "What actually happens is again uncertain but the outcome may be counterintuitive to what people expect.",
      "So the marginal fall in UK inflation can be seen as something of a firebreak, for now, popping something of the frothy hysteria seen over the past few weeks. Those shorting the UK on international markets will see that there is another side to this bet. UK inflation is in the middle of the G7 pack.",
      "That said, what has been called a global \"bond market tantrum\" remains in place, sensitive to every new piece of data. The UK government still has to convince on the detail of growth plans. It will mean fast-tracking infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies.",
      "Market borrowing rates remain at levels where the chancellor will probably need to course-correct spending plans with new cuts before Easter, in order to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "The shadow cast over inflationary prospects and so all markets by Donald Trump's unconventional trade policies looms large.",
      "The turbulence has not gone away. Inflation is likely to tick up again in the coming months. But right now headline and underlying inflation numbers in the UK all point in the right direction. It is a welcome safe harbour for now, but the seas remain choppy."

      "According to SEC rules, investors whose holdings surpass 5% have 10 days to report that they have crossed that threshold. Musk did so 21 days after the purchase, the filing says.",
      "In a social media post, Musk called the SEC a \"totally broken organisation.\"",
      "He also accused the regulator of wasting its time when \"there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished.\"",
      "\"Musk's violation resulted in substantial economic harm to investors,\" the SEC complaint said.",

      "In 2018, the regulator charged Musk with defrauding investors by claiming he had \"funding secured\" to take Tesla, the electric car company he leads, private.",
      "He later settled the charges, stepping down as chairman of the firm's board and agreeing to accept what was dubbed a Twitter sitter - limits on what he could write on social media about the company."

      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her.",

      "\"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\"",
      "In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her.",
      "Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasury included tackling corruption in UK financial markets, was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to \u00a33.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh.",
      "Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year.",
      "Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies.",
      "The Financial Times reported that one of the properties, a flat in King's Cross, had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government.",
      "According to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 Siddiq had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story.",
      "Labour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt.",
      "Sir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog.",
      "In his letter, Sir Laurie said Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in Kings Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\".",
      "He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\".",
      "This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie.",
      "Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\".",
      "In the letter, Sir Laurie said: \"A lack of records and lapse of time has meant that, unfortunately, I have not been able to obtain comprehensive comfort in relation to all the UK property-related matters referred to in the media.",
      "\"However, I have not identified evidence of improprieties connected with the actions taken by Ms Siddiq and/or her husband in relation to their ownership or occupation of the London properties that have been the subject of press attention.",

      "She attended the power plant's signing ceremony and was pictured with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Sir Laurie said Siddiq had \"explained the context\" of that visit as \"solely for the social purpose of joining family and enjoying the tourist access to the city facilitated as a result of her aunt's official visit as head of state\".",
      "He said Siddiq had been clear that she had \"no involvement in any inter-governmental discussions between Bangladesh and Russia or any form of official role\".",
      "\"I accept this at face value,\" he said, \"but should note that this visit may form part of investigations in Bangladesh.\"",
      "Sir Laurie added that Siddiq was a \"prominent member of one of the principal families involved in Bangladesh politics\" which had \"exposed her to allegations of misconduct by association\".",
      "\"Given the nature of Ms Siddiq's ministerial responsibilities... it is regrettable that she was not more alert to the potential reputational risks - both to her and the government - arising from her close family's association with Bangladesh,\" he said.",

      "Chancellor will remain for all of Parliament, Downing Street says",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "The chancellor was addressing the Commons following her return to the UK from a trip to China to drum up investment.",
      "During the debate, she accused Conservative critics of ignoring \"global volatility\" behind rising borrowing costs in other countries such as the US, Germany and France.",
      "\"The economic headwinds that we face are a reminder that we should, indeed we must, go further and faster in our plan to kick-start economic growth that plunged under the last government,\" she told MPs.",

      "Sector-specific announcements, like this week's strategy for boosting artificial intelligence, will be rolled out in the coming weeks.",
      "Reeves is navigating a critical moment as Chancellor, with investors demanding higher returns on UK government bonds - known as gilts.",
      "The yields - the interest rate at which the government pays back investors - on gilts are a key indicator of market confidence.",
      "On Tuesday, the yield on 30-year gilts stood at 5.42% - close to the highest since 1998.  Meanwhile the yield on debt due for repayment in 10 years was 4.87% - close to the highest since 2008.",
      "If sustained, higher UK borrowing costs may raise annual debt interest by \u00a310bn by 2029-30, wiping out the Chancellor's \u00a310bn headroom against her self-imposed fiscal rules.",

      "Speaking in the Commons, Stride accused the government of having \"talked down the economy\" and \"crippled businesses\" with rises in the Budget to employers' National Insurance (NI) contributions.",
      "\"Growth has been killed stone dead, inflation is rising impacting millions, interest rates are staying higher for longer, and business confidence has fallen through the floor,\" he added.",
      "\"This is a crisis made in Downing Street.\"",
      "Conservative MP Luke Evans added to the criticism, claiming higher bond yields showed \"the markets do not believe her plan for growth\".",

      "The chancellor spent the weekend in China seeking new investment, sparking claims she was capitulating to Beijing and dodging awkward questions in parliament.",
      "During the debate, Reeves argued agreements reached during her visit to China would be worth \u00a3600m to the UK over the next five years.",
      "But Stride argued the current higher level of debt interest costs would be \"100 times what she says she has brought back from Beijing\".",

      "\"You can't raise tough issues if you're not in the room,\" Reeves said.",
      "On Monday, Sir Keir Starmer said he had \"full confidence\" in Reeves and the government was committed to its fiscal rules.",

      "Boeing said there was \"work underway\" to improve its culture, and to \"restore trust and deliver for our customers\".",

    "summary": "The measure is meant to help tackle the country's housing crisis, the prime minister said.",
    "story": [
      "Spain is planning to impose a tax of up to 100% on the value of properties bought by non-residents from countries outside the EU, such as the UK.",
      "Announcing the move, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said the \"unprecedented\" measure was necessary to meet the country's housing emergency.",
      "\"The West faces a decisive challenge: To not become a society divided into two classes, the rich landlords and poor tenants,\" he said.",

      "His office described the proposed measure as a way to limit the purchase of homes by \"non-resident non-EU foreigners\". In Spain, people are classed as non-residents if they live in the country for less than 183 days in a single year.",
      "It added: \"The tax burden that they will have to pay in case of purchase will be increased up to 100% of the value of the property, in line with countries such as Denmark and Canada.\"",
      "The Spanish government said the proposal would be finalised \"after careful study\".",
      "The total number of sales to foreigners, including people from inside the EU, makes up around 15% of the Spanish housing market - that's 87,000 out of 583,000 sales in 2023 - according to the Spanish property registry.",

      "\"Naturally who wants to pay 100% purchase tax for buying a property here,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"The Brits have always been big buyers here in Spain, but obviously it is going to increase the buying power of EU citizens like the German, French and Belgians, so it doesn't appear to be very fair just to isolate non-EU buyers.\"",
      "He added: \"Something needs to happen to increase the amount of houses coming onto the market, but this is an extreme proposal.\"",
      "Antonio de la Fuente, managing director at Colliers International Spain, told BBC World Business Report he did not think 100% tax would solve the housing problem.",
      "\"We all agree we are in a problem of not enough supply and we need to produce new supply to give people migrating from other parts of Spain to big cities like Madrid, Valencia, [and] Malaga a new home.",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will remain in her role \"for the whole of this Parliament\", Downing Street has said, as she faces criticism over the falling pound and rising government borrowing costs.",

      "Borrowing costs are rising for many countries across the world, but some have argued that decisions made in the Budget appear to have made the UK more vulnerable.",
      "The Conservatives said the chancellor was \"hanging on by her fingernails\".",
      "When asked at a press conference earlier whether Reeves would remain chancellor for the whole of the Parliament, the prime minister declined to answer, but did then say she had his \"full confidence\" and was doing a \"fantastic job\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"The prime minister just refused to back his chancellor staying in her job.",
      "\"The markets are in turmoil and business confidence has crashed, yet the chancellor is nowhere to be seen.\"",
      "However, the prime minister's official spokesman later said: \"You heard from the prime minister this morning.",
      "\"He was very explicit (that) he has full confidence in the chancellor and he'll be working with her in the role of chancellor for the whole of this Parliament.\"",
      "The row comes after the chancellor defended her decision to travel to China to improve economic ties with the country, despite the uncertainty in the financial markets.",
      "The Conservatives said she had \"fled to China\", but Reeves said agreements reached in Beijing would be worth \u00a3600m to the UK over the next five years.",
      "Reeves is a central figure in the Labour government, presented to the voters as a safe pair of hands in the run-up to the election. She also led the work to build bridges with business.",
      "But business and some other observers were shaken by her first Budget in October, which they fear could knock the wind from the economy further, rather than spur the growth Labour has promised.",
      "Market jitters over the past week have increased concerns over the government's economic strategy.",
      "Rising borrowing costs will have a knock-on effect on the government's tax and spending plans, because it will have to pay more interest to finance its existing debt. That leaves less to spend on public services and investment.",
      "Trump factor",
      "Governments generally borrow money by selling bonds to big investors, such as pension funds. UK government bonds are known as gilts.",
      "The yield on the 10-year gilt - the interest rate at which the government pays back a decade-long loan to investors - rose to 4.88% on Monday, its highest level for 17 years.",
      "The 30-year gilt yield climbed to 5.44%, its highest in 27 years.",
      "Government debt costs in Germany, France, Spain and Italy also rose on Monday.",
      "Some experts say investors are reacting to the re-election of former US President Donald Trump and his talk of tariffs.",
      "There is concern this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought, and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as expected, both in the US and elsewhere.",
      "Strong US jobs data released on Friday added to expectations that US rates will stay higher for longer, and this has helped to strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies.",
      "However, Emma Wall, head of platform investors at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the UK's problems were not purely caused by global issues, arguing that measures announced in the Budget have stoked inflation.",
      "\"If you can get inflation under control, you will see interest rates come down in the UK,\" she added.",
      "Reeves also faced questions over her self-imposed rules on government debt and spending, which she said on Saturday were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "Despite her commitment, some have questioned whether she will be able to achieve the targets without making further spending cuts or tax rises because of how government debt costs have risen.",
      "On Monday, Sir Keir said the government was going to keep to its fiscal rules.",

      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Reeves faces 'difficult decisions' on tax and spending",
      "Confidence 'bruised'",
      "The government has made growing the UK's economy a key objective, but recent figures indicate the economy saw zero growth between July and September, while it contracted during October.",
      "Businesses have warned that Budget measures, such as the rise in employer National Insurance contributions, together with the higher National Living Wage could lead to job cuts and price rises.",
      "Rupert Soames, chair of the Confederation of British Business (CBI), said the picture was \"not good\" but insisted that firms were still somewhat upbeat.",
      "\"I wouldn't say confidence is gone,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"I'd say it's bruised.\"",
      "However, he said the government was making the situation worse by introducing the Employment Rights Bill, which he said contained \"powerful dissuaders to employment\".",
      "Unions argue the protections introduced in the bill, such as banning fire-and-rehire, make employees safer, while the government has said it \"represents the biggest upgrade in employment rights for a generation\".",
      "However, Mr Soames said the bill would lead to job losses.",
      "\"Businesses will not only not employ, they will let people go,\" he said.",
      "As part of its push for growth, the government revealed plans on Monday to make the UK the global capital of artificial intelligence through measures such as building a new supercomputer.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence presents a \"vast potential\" for rejuvenating UK public services, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday.",
      "In a speech setting out the government's plans to use AI across the UK to boost growth and deliver services more efficiently, Sir Keir said the government had a responsibility to make AI \"work for working people\".",
      "The AI Opportunities Action Plan is backed by leading tech firms, some of which have committed \u00a314bn towards various projects, creating 13,250 jobs, the government said.",
      "But the government faces questions over how much time and money will be needed to make its vision a reality, amid concerns over borrowing costs and the falling value of the pound.",
      "The plan includes proposals for growth zones where development will be focused, and suggests the technology will be used to help tackle issues such as potholes.",
      "While estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) support the claim that AI could increase productivity, it also says the changes may come gradually.",
      "The government tasked AI adviser Matt Clifford with creating a UK action plan for supporting the growth of artificial intelligence and its use in public services.",
      "He came back with 50 recommendations which are now being implemented.",
      "Among these is for the UK to invest in a new supercomputer to boost computing power - marking a change in strategy after the Labour government ditched the previous government's plans for a supercomputer at Edinburgh University.",
      "Sir Keir said AI \"will drive incredible change\" in the country and \"has the potential to transform the lives of working people\".",
      "\"We're going to make AI work for everyone in our country,\" he added, saying the \"battle for the jobs of tomorrow is happening today\".",
      "Sir Keir said the UK would become one of the AI \"superpowers\" - mirroring former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's drive to boost the UK sector so it could rival that of the US and China.",
      "At the time, many of Sunak's proposals were geared towards mitigating future risks of highly powerful AI systems.",
      "In October 2023, he said AI could enable faster, easier production of chemical and biological weapons, or be used by terrorist groups to spread disinformation.",
      "He added that in a worst-case scenario, society could lose control over AI.",
      "His government's emphasis on \"safety\" seems largely absent in this new plan  - instead focusing on maximising opportunities, growth and innovation.",
      "The pivot away from the previous narrative of caution and safety suggests the government has decided the UK should attempt to compete in the AI arms race, currently lead by major global players including the US and China.",
      "However, building data centres and boosting the nation's computing power will not happen overnight.",
      "This means the government is unlikely to see the end results of this major project ahead of the next general election - when Labour will have to convince voters that it was still the right decision, at a time when public finances remain stretched.",
      "Professor Dame Wendy Hall said the proposals were \"ambitious\", but necessary to help the UK keep up with the pace of development.",
      "\"It's an ambitious plan but there's a lot of upfront investment,\" she told BBC Radio Four's Today programme.",
      "\"It will take some time to see a return on that investment and they've got to be in it for the long-term.\"",
      "How the AI plan could affect you",
      "Among the government's proposals are:",
      "AI will be used by the public sector to enable its workers to spend less time doing admin and more time delivering services.Several \"AI Growth Zones\" around the UK will be created, involving big building projects and new jobs.AI will be fed through cameras around the country to inspect roads and spot potholes that need fixing Teachers and small business owners were highlighted as two groups that could start using AI for things like faster planning and record-keeping.AI is already being used in UK hospitals for important tasks such as diagnosing cancer more quickly and it will continue to be used to support the NHS.",

      "But shadow science secretary Alan Mak said Labour was \"delivering analogue government in a digital age\".",
      "While the push towards AI is seen as way of cutting down on public spending, Mak accused Labour of undermining this goal with its economic policies.",
      "\"Labour's economic mismanagement and uninspiring plan will mean Britain is left behind,\" he said.",
      "Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle told the BBC there was no reason why the UK could not create tech companies on the same scale as Google, Amazon, and Apple.",
      "\"At the moment, we don't have any frontier conceptual, cutting-edge companies that are British-owned.\"",
      "He highlighted DeepMind, which created technology enabling computers to play video and board games, as an example of a former British-born company that was now US-owned.",
      "It was founded by three University College London students before its acquisition by Google.",
      "Tim Flagg, chief operating officer of UKAI - a trade body representing British AI businesses - said the proposals take a \"narrow view\" of the sector's contributors and focus too much on big tech.",
      "\"AI innovation spans industries, from small enterprises to non-tech sectors, all driving the new industrial revolution,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time the government recognised this broader definition and tapped into the full potential of AI across the UK.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "Is AI the answer for better government services?",
      "AI 'not perfect'",
      "There are continuing questions over the risks of introducing AI systems that can \"hallucinate\" or make things up, or discriminate against certain groups of people due to bias.",

    "story": [
      "The hum of sewing machines is a constant in parts of Guangzhou, a thriving port on the Pearl River in southern China.",
      "It rattles through the open windows of factories from morning until late at night, as they finish the t-shirts, shorts, blouses, pants and swimwear that will be shipped to fill wardrobes in more than 150 countries.",
      "This is the sound of Panyu, the neighbourhood known as the \"Shein village\", a warren of factories that power the world's largest fast fashion retailer.",
      "\"If there are 31 days in a month, I will work 31 days,\" one worker told the BBC.",
      "Most said they only have one day off a month.",
      "The BBC spent several days here: we visited 10 factories, spoke to four owners and more than 20 workers. We also spent time at labour markets and textile suppliers.",
      "We found that the beating heart of this empire is a workforce sitting behind sewing machines for around 75 hours a week in contravention of Chinese labour laws.",
      "These hours are not unusual in Guangzhou, an industrial hub for rural workers in search of a higher income; or in China, which has long been the world's unrivalled factory.",
      "But they add to a growing list of questions about Shein, once a little-known Chinese-founded company that has become a global behemoth in just over five years.",
      "Still privately-owned, it was valued at about \u00a354bn ($66bn) in a fundraising round in 2023. It is now eyeing a potential listing on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "Its meteoric rise, however, has been dogged with controversy about its treatment of workers and allegations of forced labour.",
      "Last year it admitted to finding children working in its factories in China.",
      "The company declined to be interviewed but told the BBC in a statement that \"Shein is committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain\" and is investing tens of millions of dollars in strengthening governance and compliance.",
      "It added: \"We strive to set the highest standards for pay and we require that all supply chain partners adhere to our code of conduct. Furthermore, Shein works with auditors to ensure compliance.\"",
      "Shein's success lies in volume - the inventory online runs into the hundreds of thousands - and deep discounts: \u00a310 dresses, \u00a36 sweaters, prices that hover below \u00a38 on average.",
      "Revenue has soared, outstripping the likes of H&M, Zara and Primark. The cut-price sales are driven by places like the Shein village, home to some 5,000 factories, most of them Shein suppliers.",
      "The buildings have been hollowed out to make way for sewing machines, rolls of fabric and bags brimming with cloth scraps. The doors to their basements are always open for the seemingly endless cycle of deliveries and collections.",
      "As the day passes, the shelves fill up with warehouse-bound, clear plastic bags labelled with a now-distinctive five-letter noun.",
      "But even past 22:00, the sewing machines - and the people hunched over them - don't stop as more fabric arrives, in trucks so full that bolts of colour sometimes tumble onto the factory floor.",
      "\"We usually work, 10, 11 or 12 hours a day,\" says a 49-year-old woman from Jiangxi unwilling to give her name. \"On Sundays we work around three hours less.\"",
      "She is in an alleyway, where a dozen people are huddled around a row of bulletin boards.",
      "They are reading the job ads on the board, while examining the stitching on a pair of chinos draped over it.",
      "This is Shein's supply chain. The factories are contracted to make clothes on order - some small, some big. If the chinos are a hit, orders will ramp up and so must production. Factories then hire temporary workers to meet the demand their permanent staff cannot fulfil.",
      "The migrant worker from Jiangxi is looking for a short-term contract - and the chinos are an option.",
      "\"We earn so little. The cost of living is now so high,\" she says, adding that she hopes to make enough to send back to her two children who are living with their grandparents.",
      "\"We get paid per piece,\" she explains. \"It depends how difficult the item is. Something simple like a t-shirt is one-two yuan [less than a dollar] per piece and I can make around a dozen in an hour.\"",
      "Examining the stitching on the chinos is crucial for making that decision. All around her, workers are calculating how much they will get paid to make each piece of clothing and how many they can make in an hour.",
      "The alleys of Panyu function as labour markets, filling up in the mornings as workers and scooters rush past the breakfast dumpling cart, the cups of steaming soybean milk and the hopeful farmer selling chicken and duck eggs.",
      "Standard working hours appear to be from 08:00 to well past 22:00, the BBC found.",
      "This is consistent with a report from the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye, which was based on interviews with 13 textile workers at factories producing clothes for Shein.",
      "They found that a number of staff were working excessive overtime. It noted the basic wage without overtime was 2,400 yuan (\u00a3265; $327) - below the 6,512 yuan the Asia Floor Wage Alliance says is needed for a \"living wage\". But the workers we spoke to managed to earn anywhere between 4,000 and 10,000 yuan a month.",
      "\"These hours are not unusual, but it's clear that it's illegal and it violates basic human rights,\" said David Hachfield from the group. \"It's an extreme form of exploitation and this needs to be visible.\"",
      "The average working week should not exceed 44 hours, according to Chinese labour laws, which also state that employers should ensure workers have at least one rest day a week. If an employer wants to extend these hours, it should be for special reasons.",
      "While Shein's headquarters are now in Singapore, there is no denying the majority of its products are made in China.",
      "And Shein's success has drawn the attention of Washington, which is increasingly wary of Chinese firms.",
      "In June, Donald Trump's pick for US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said he had  \"grave ethics concerns\" about Shein's \"deep ties to the People's Republic of China\": \"Slave labour, sweatshops, and trade tricks are the dirty secrets behind Shein's success,\" he wrote.",
      "Not everyone would agree with Rubio's choice of words to describe the conditions at Shein's suppliers. But rights groups say that the long working hours, which have become a way of life for many in Guangzhou, are unfair and exploitative.",
      "The machines dictate the rhythm of the day.",
      "They pause for lunch and dinner when the workers, metal plates and chopsticks in hand, file into the canteen to buy food. If there is no more space to sit, they stand in the street.",
      "\"I've been working in these factories for more than 40 years,\" said one woman who spent just 20 minutes eating her meal. This was just another day for her.",
      "Inside, the factories we visit are not cramped. There is enough light and industrial-sized fans have been brought in to keep workers cool. Huge posters urge staff to report underage workers - likely a response to finding two cases of child labour in the supply chain last year.",
      "The BBC understands that the company is keeping a closer eye on its suppliers ahead of plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "\"This is about their reputation,\" says Sheng Lu, a professor in Fashion and Apparel Studies at the University of Delaware. \"If Shein can successfully achieve an IPO then it means they are recognised as a decent company. But if they are to keep the confidence of investors, they have to take some responsibility.\"",
      "One of the biggest challenges Shein faces is accusations that it sources cotton from China's Xinjiang region.",
      "Once touted as among the world's best fabric, Xinjiang's cotton has fallen out of favour after allegations that it is produced using forced labour by people from the Muslim Uyghur minority - a charge that Beijing has consistently denied.",
      "The only way to get around this criticism is to be more transparent, Prof Sheng says.",
      "\"Unless you fully release your factory list, unless you make your supply chain more transparent to the public, then I think it's going to be very challenging for Shein.\"",
      "A major advantage, he adds, is that Shein's supply chain is in China: \"Very few countries have a complete supply chain. China has this - and nobody can compete.\"",
      "Aspiring rivals like Vietnam and Bangladesh import raw materials from China to make clothes. But Chinese factories rely entirely on local sources for everything, from fabric to zippers and buttons. So it's easy to make a variety of garments, and they are able to do it quickly.",
      "That especially works for Shein whose algorithm determines orders. If shoppers repeatedly click on a certain dress, or spend longer looking at a wool sweater, the firm knows to ask factories to make more - and fast.",
      "For workers in Guangzhou, this can be a challenge.",
      "\"Shein has its pros and cons,\" one factory owner told us. \"The good thing is the order is eventually big, but profit is low and it's fixed.\"",
      "Shein, given its size and influence, is a hard bargainer. So factory owners have to cut costs elsewhere, often resulting in lower staff wages.",
      "\"Before Shein, we produced and sold clothes on our own,\" said an owner of three factories. \"We could estimate the cost, decide the price  and calculate the profit. Now Shein controls the price, and you have to think about ways to reduce the cost.\"",
      "When orders peak, however, it's a bonanza. The company ships around one million packages a day on average, according to data from ShipMatrix, a logistics consultancy firm.",
      "\"Shein is a pillar of the fashion industry,\" said Guo Qing E, a Shein supplier.",
      "\"I started when Shein started. I witnessed its rise. To be honest, Shein is an awesome company in China. I think it will become stronger, because it pays on time. This is where it is most trustworthy.",
      "\"If payment for our goods is due on the 15th, no matter whether it's millions or tens of millions, the money will be paid on time.\"",
      "Shein, with its gruelling hours and sometimes lower wages, may not be a source of comfort to all its workers. But it is a source of pride for some.",
      "\"This is the contribution we Chinese people can make to the world,\" said a 33- year-old supervisor from Guangdong, who didn't want to give her name.",
      "It's dark outside and workers are filing back into factories after their dinner for the final stretch. She admits the hours are long, but \"we get on well with each other. We are like a family\".",
      "Hours later, after many workers head home for the night, the lights in several buildings stay on.",
      "Some people work until midnight, one factory owner told us. They want to earn more money, he said.",

      "The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.",
      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",

      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",

      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",

      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's planned tariffs are expected to greatly impact international trade in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation, interest rates and tariffs mean 2025 is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy. One in which growth is expected to remain at a \"stable yet underwhelming\" 3.2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. So what might that mean for all of us?",
      "Exactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers - a third interest rate cut in a row.",
      "However, stock markets fell sharply because the world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, made clear they shouldn't expect as many further cuts in 2025 as they might have hoped for, as the battle against inflation continues.",
      "\"From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly.",
      "Despite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called \"last mile\" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing.",
      "However, the biggest difficulty for global growth \"is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0\", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan.",
      "Since Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico.",
      "\"The US is going into a more isolationist policy stance, raising tariffs, trying to provide more effective protection to US manufacturing,\" says Mr Oganes.",
      "\"And even though that is going to support US growth, at least in the short term, certainly it's going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the US.\"",
      "New tariffs \"could be particularly devastating\" for Mexico and Canada, but also be \"harmful\" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama.",
      "He cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that \"depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market\".",
      "That has the potential to push up prices, reduce demand for products, and hurt company profits, which could in turn drag down investment levels, he explains.",
      "Mr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: \"Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession.\"",
      "The tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Even though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead.",
      "In his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the \"challenges of uncertainties in the external environment\", but said the economy was on \"an upward trajectory\".",
      "Exports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle.",
      "Those efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025.",
      "Beijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year.",
      "\"Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,\" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick.",
      "Those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is \"more welcoming\" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.",
      "Tensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere.",
      "However, Mr Hart points out that \"it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer\", and whilst \"companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China.\"",
      "One industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them.",
      "Beijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization.",
      "However, it's the prospect of Donald Trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU.",
      "\"Restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth, and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain,\" the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last month. \"[But] in the short term, it's probably net inflationary.\"",
      "Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe's economic growth. But their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that, despite a recent uptick in growth, the eurozone risks losing momentum in the year ahead.",
      "That is, unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments.",
      "In the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases, according to one survey.",
      "One barrier to cutting eurozone interest rates is that domestic inflation, which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors, remains at 4.2%. That's more than double the overall inflation target of 2%, and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further.",
      "It's been similar in the US according to Sander van 't Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad, the world's biggest recruitment firm.",
      "\"In the US, for instance, [wage inflation] is still going to be around 4% in 2024. In some Western European countries, it's even higher than that.",
      "\"I think there's two factors there. There's the talent scarcity, but there's also, of course, the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do.\"",
      "Mr van 't Noordende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers, which is adding upward pressure to general inflation.",
      "A slowdown in the global jobs market reflects a lack of \"dynamism\" from companies and economic growth is key to reversing that, he says.",
      "\"If the economy is doing well, businesses are growing, they start hiring. People see interesting opportunities, and you just start seeing people moving around\".",
      "One person starting a new role in 2025 is Donald Trump, and a raft of economic plans including tax cuts and deregulation could help the US economy to continue to thrive.",
      "Whilst much won't be revealed before he's back in the White House on 20 January,  \"everything points to continued US exceptionalism at the expense of the rest of the world,\" says JP Morgan's Mr Oganes.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 04:57:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Labour paused implementation of the act after taking power, due to concerns over student welfare.",
    "story": [
      "The government has confirmed plans to reintroduce a piece of legislation aimed at protecting free speech on university campuses.",
      "The Higher Education Freedom of Speech Act, which proposed fines for universities failing to uphold freedom of speech, was passed under the previous, Conservative government in 2023.",
      "But its implementation was stopped shortly after Labour's election win last summer over concerns the law was potentially damaging to student welfare.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told Parliament the government would be progressing with the legislation but with significant changes.",
      "The act said universities had a duty to \"secure\" and \"promote the importance\" of freedom of speech and academic expression.",
      "It included controversial new powers in which the regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), would have been able to fine or sanction higher education providers and student unions in England.",
      "A new complaints scheme for students, staff and visiting speakers was also included. They could seek compensation if they suffered from a breach of a university's free-speech obligations.",
      "However, last July the education secretary paused the law days before it was due to come into force, over fears it could protect people using hate speech on campuses and expose universities to expensive legal action.",
      "At the time, a government source told the BBC the legislation would have opened the way for Holocaust deniers to be allowed on campus, and was an \"antisemite charter\".",
      "Phillipson told Parliament in July that the delay would allow time to consider whether the law would be repealed.",
      "Having spent the last six months considering what to do, the act is now being brought back.",
      "Issuing fines",
      "In a statement, Phillipson said academic freedom was \"much more important than the wishes of some students not to be offended\".",
      "However, the government says it will seek to remove the part of the act that allows people to sue universities that fail to uphold their duty to protect freedom of speech.",
      "It could result in long and costly legal battles, at a time when many universities were already struggling financially, the government said.",
      "There will also no longer be direct responsibility on student unions under the law, though Phillipson said they would still be expected to support free speech and held to account by their university.",
      "The National Union of Students welcomed the announcement, saying the threat of complex legal responsibilities was no longer hanging over them.",
      "The OfS would retain powers to investigate alleged breaches of free speech under the law, the government said, as well as issuing fines.",
      "Shadow education secretary Laura Trott described the changes as a \"wrecking ball\" to the policy, and questioned what the consequences would be for universities alleged to have breached their free speech duties with the threat of legal action removed.",
      "'Inciting violence'",
      "But the government said it would provide a workable version of the act that would protect minority groups while defending freedom of speech on campuses.",
      "The Union of Jewish Students (UJS) welcomed the revised act, saying it \"takes into account the concerns raised by UJS and other parties\".",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents 140 higher education providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day that academic freedom and freedom of speech were \"essential\" to universities and she was glad the legislation was coming back.",
      "But some of the original provisions in the act would \"gum up the works like you wouldn't believe\" for universities, she said.",
      "When the legislation was originally introduced, then-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it would allow speakers to \"articulate views which others may disagree with as long as they don't meet the threshold of hate speech or inciting violence\".",
      "'Toothless tiger'",
      "Protests have taken place on university campuses in recent years, including before a talk by gender-critical academic Kathleen Stock at Oxford.",
      "There have also been cases of individuals being \"no-platformed\", where a controversial speaker is banned from an event.",
      "The education secretary said there had been too many such examples of freedom of speech not being upheld at universities and \"unacceptable\" cases like that of Prof Jo Phoenix, who was found by an employment tribunal to have been discriminated against and harassed at work because of her gender-critical beliefs.",
      "But Prof Phoenix told BBC News the revised version of the act was like a \"toothless tiger\" and the suppression of free speech still posed a \"real and visceral threat to the robustness of our universities\".",

      "Urgent action is needed to stop a \"lost generation\" of children leaving school without ever getting the support they need for their special educational needs and disabilities (Send), MPs have warned.",
      "In a highly critical report, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found a Send system \"in disarray\", \"mired in red tape, lacking funding, and failing to produce value for money\".",
      "An estimated 1.7 million school-aged children have special education needs and disabilities in England.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) said the government was \"making progress\" on the issue with a \u00a31bn investment in Send.",
      "Appearing before the education committee on Wednesday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said wider reform was needed and that \"children with Send have been forgotten for far too long\".",
      "\"Parents have lost confidence and councils are increasingly being pushed to the brink,\" she said.",
      "Most Send children, who require more educational support than their peers, are taught in mainstream schools.",
      "Those with further needs can get legal entitlement to more specific support, often in a specialist school, via an education, health and care plan (EHCP).",
      "The report from the PAC, which scrutinises public spending, said there were 576,000 children with an EHCP in January 2024.",
      "One of them is Rachel Morgan's seven-year-old son Max, who has autism and ADHD.",
      "Mum Rachel, from Birmingham, said Max missed much of his schooling during a \"never-ending battle\" to get support for him, but that he was now \"brimming with confidence\" in a specialist school.",
      "Despite that, the lack of specialist places means the school is a 45-minute journey away.",
      "PAC chairman Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said parents who were seeking Send support for their children faced a \"chaotic\" system.",
      "\"The immensity of this situation cannot be overstated,\" he said.",
      "\"As a nation, we are failing countless children. We have been doing so for years.",
      "\"This is an emergency that has been allowed to run and run. This report must serve as a line in the sand for government.\"",
      "The committee's report found demand for EHCPs had soared by 140% in the last decade - but that the government did not fully understand why, which limited the system's ability to cope with demand.",
      "It also found many councils failed to provide EHCPs for children who need them within the 20-week timeframe required by law.",
      "And there were huge regional differences between local authority areas providing EHCPs on time, creating a \"postcode lottery\" for families.",

      "It warned 40% of councils would be \"staring down bankruptcy\" next year, when a scheme allowing local authorities to keep those deficits off their financial books expires.",
      "Current \"piecemeal interventions\" were doing nothing to improve the sustainability of the system, which was in urgent need of reform, the report said.",
      "Councillor Arooj Shah, from the Local Government Association, which represents councils across England, called for councils' spending deficits on Send to be \"written off\".",
      "Phillipson told the education committee she \"recognised the urgency\" to provide more information for councils setting their budgets for next year, adding that the government would set out more on their plans around Send deficits as soon as possible.",
      "'Culture of belonging'",
      "One of the report's recommendations to government was to explain how mainstream schools can be more inclusive for Send pupils.",
      "The government recently announced \u00a3740m for schools to adapt their buildings to make them more accessible.",
      "Ninestiles, an academy in Birmingham, has 45 Send pupils based in a specialist resource centre at the school.",
      "They spend approximately 70% of their time in mainstream education and 30% in specialist lessons.",
      "Principal Alex Hughes said a \"really inclusive environment\" was central to a \"culture of belonging\" at the school.",
      "He said the system's focus should be on \"celebrating the brilliant contributions\" Send pupils can make to their schools, but added that many families had struggled to find support for their children.",
      "Councillor Roger Gough, from the County Councils Network, which represents councils in England, said the report was the latest which showed the Send system was \"no longer viable\".",
      "Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said the committee had highlighted \"the full drastic extent of the crisis in Send\".",
      "Schools Minister Catherine McKinnell said the system had been \"failing families with Send children for far too long\".",
      "\"These problems are deep-rooted and will take time to fix, but we remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver the change that exhausted families are crying out for by ensuring better earlier intervention and inclusion,\" she added.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 16:41:45 GMT",
    "summary": "The rapper withdraws a case accusing his label of artificially boosting the success of Not Like Us.",
    "story": [
      "Rap superstar Drake is suing Universal Music Group (UMG) for defamation and harassment, over its release of the Kendrick Lamar diss track Not Like Us last year.",
      "The song, which formed part of a furious back and forth between the two stars, accused Drake and his entourage of being \"certified paedophiles\" who should \"be registered and placed on neighbourhood watch\".",
      "In papers filed in New York, Drake's lawyers accused the record label of launching \"a campaign to create a viral hit\" out of a song that made the \"false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\".",
      "Universal has yet to respond to the allegations.",
      "The move comes just 24 hours after Drake withdrew a separate legal action against UMG and Spotify,  in which he accused the two companies of conspiring to artificially boost streams of Not Like Us, at the expense of his own music.",
      "In that case, he argued that Universal had licensed the song \"at drastically reduced rates to Spotify\" and used bots to generate extra plays, generating \"the false impression that the song was more popular than it was in reality\".",
      "In a statement at the time, Universal told the BBC: \"The suggestion that [the company] would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue.\"",
      "It added that \"no amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments... can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\"",
      "Spotify also responded that there was \"no economic incentive for users to stream Not Like Us over any of Drake's tracks\".",
      "The Swedish streaming company later filed an opposition brief to Drake's petition, stating that it \"should be denied\".",
      "His lawyers withdrew the case on Tuesday, after meeting with representatives from both companies, according to court papers.",
      "Drake takes legal action over Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Not Like Us",
      "Drake takes legal action over song's 'sex offender' claim",
      "The feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar explained",
      "That appeared to draw a line under the legal action - until the story took a dramatic twist on Wednesday morning.",
      "In a lawsuit filed at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Drake accused Universal - which distributes both his music and Lamar's - of prioritising \"corporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists\".",
      "His lawyers noted that the artwork for Not Like Us was based on an aerial photograph of Drake's $100m Toronto mansion, dotted with red markers that are often used to represent the presence of registered sex offenders.",
      "The court documents link that artwork to a shooting at the property shortly after the release of Kendrick's song, calling it \"the 2024 equivalent of 'Pizzagate'\".",
      "The comment referenced a conspiracy theory about a US child sex ring operating out of a Washington pizza restaurant, which led to a gunman opening fire on the eaterie in 2016.",
      "Not Like Us was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between Drake and Lamar, which dates back to the early 2010s.",
      "In the lyrics, Lamar alleges that Drake \"likes 'em young\" and accuses him of using other, more credible rappers, to boost his profile.",
      "Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, where he rejected the allegations, saying, \"I never been with no one under age\". He also claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent.",
      "However, his retort failed to attract the same attention as Not Like Us, which debuted at number one in the US chart and attracted more than 1 billion streams on Spotify.",
      "The song is nominated for five prizes, including record and song of the year, at the Grammy Awards on 3 February. A week later, Lamar will headline the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "However, the new lawsuit is not aimed at Lamar himself, according to Drake's lawyers.",
      "\"This lawsuit is not about the artist who created Not Like Us,\" the court documents says.",
      "\"It is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\""

      "Former Coronation Street actress Helen Flanagan has been banned from driving for six months despite claiming it would cause her \"exceptional hardship\".",
      "The 34-year-old said her boyfriend Robbie Talbot was driving her Audi when it was caught speeding twice on Merseyside in June last year.",
      "She appeared at Wirral Magistrates' Court earlier charged with two counts of failing to give information relating to the identification of a driver.",
      "Magistrates said they were not satisfied that a ban would cause Flanagan, who already had six points on her licence, exceptional hardship and also ordered her to pay a \u00a32,000 fine, \u00a3800 victim surcharge and \u00a3110 prosecution costs.",
      "Flanagan said the remote location of her Bolton home meant she would \"really struggle without a car\".",
      "The mother-of-three said she was \"struggling\" financially and would not be able to afford taxis to take her youngest son to nursery.",
      "She said: \"My job really is being a mum at home. Their dad works away. It's really difficult at the moment now for me to be earning money.",
      "\"I earn money on social media but it kind of varies what I earn.\"",
      "She added: \"I think there might be a perception maybe that I would easily be able to afford a driver but that's quite far from the case.",
      "\"I've got enough money in my account to pay off my tax and my VAT and basically that's about it.\"",
      "'Really difficult'",
      "She said she also needed the car to take her two older children to after-school activities, go to her therapist in Birmingham and meet her ex-partner, footballer Scott Sinclair, at a service station in Birmingham when the children went to stay with him.",
      "She said she had told Mr Talbot, who sat at the back of court for the hearing, he needed to reply to police when she had received the speeding fines.",
      "\"I very stupidly and naively thought it was acceptable for my boyfriend to reply on my behalf to explain to the police it was him that [was] driving, it wasn't me,\" she said.",
      "Chairman of the magistrates' bench David Holley asked Flanagan if Mr Talbot would be able to drive her car if she was banned.",
      "She said: \"I would feel really, really angry if my boyfriend was to take that away from me and then he'd drive my car.",
      "\"I don't think that would sit well with me.\"",
      "Patrick Boyers, defending, said: \"She is a single mother of three children and she is doing her best.",
      "\"I would invite you to look at this case on the cold, hard facts of who is in front of you and I would invite you to find that exceptional hardship is a real possibility.\"",
      "Flanagan offered to pay the fine in \u00a31,000 monthly instalments.",
      "She was given six penalty points for each offence.",

      "Sandman author Neil Gaiman has denied allegations of sexual misconduct, saying he has \"never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever\".",
      "The 64-year-old was accused on Monday of sexual misconduct by eight women, including four who had previously spoken out.",
      "On Tuesday, in a blog post titled Breaking The Silence, Gaiman said he had read the allegations with \"horror and dismay\".",
      "He wrote: \"I've stayed quiet until now, both out of respect for the people who were sharing their stories and out of a desire not to draw even more attention to a lot of misinformation.\"",
      "He continued: \"I've always tried to be a private person, and felt increasingly that social media was the wrong place to talk about important personal matters. I've now reached the point where I feel that I should say something.",
      "\"As I read through this latest collection of accounts, there are moments I half-recognise and moments I don't, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen.",
      "\"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\"",
      "The fantasy graphic novel and science-fiction writer - whose books Good Omens, American Gods and The Sandman have been adapted for television - was the subject of a New York Magazine cover story on Monday.",
      "The magazine and its website Vulture reported allegations from eight women, four of whom also previously accused Gaiman of sexual assault in July 2024 on a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "One of the women, who had been babysitting Gaiman's five-year-old child, alleged that he offered her a bath in his garden before joining her in the tub naked, asking her to sit on his lap, and that he sexually assaulted her.",
      "'Never any abuse'",
      "The British author said he read back text messages from the time of the alleged incidents and felt they were \"of two people enjoying entirely consensual sexual relationships\".",
      "\"At the time I was in those relationships, they seemed positive and happy on both sides,\" he wrote.",
      "He acknowledged that he was \"careless with people's hearts and feelings\" and could have \"done so much better\", but said he doesn't \"accept there was any abuse\".",
      "The author said he understood that \"not everyone will believe me\" and added he would be \"doing my very best to deserve their trust, as well as the trust of my readers\".",
      "He claimed some of the allegations \"simply never happened\" while others had been \"distorted\" to \"bear no relationship to reality\", but said he would \"take responsibility for any missteps I made\".",
      "A police report accusing Gaiman of a sexual assault was made in January 2023, but the investigation was eventually dropped.",
      "Since the allegations surfaced, several of Gaiman's film and TV projects have been affected.",
      "Season three of Prime Video's Good Omens will now comprise one 90-minute episode, with Gaiman no longer involved.",
      "Disney has paused production on its film adaptation of another Gaiman title, The Graveyard Book, while Netflix has cancelled Dead Boy Detectives, although it's not clear if this was related to the allegations.",
      "Season two of The Sandman is still expected to be released this year on Netflix, however, as well as Prime Video's series adaptation of Anansi Boys."

    "title": "Linda Nolan: A life in the spotlight",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:09:20 GMT",
    "summary": "The turbulent life of one of the globally famous Nolan Sisters singing group.",
    "story": [
      "Linda Nolan and her singing sisters lived in the spotlight after their career-defining hit I'm In The Mood For Dancing in 1979 - meaning both their highs and lows were played out in public.",
      "The close-knit group, the original sisters - Linda, Anne, Denise, Maureen and Bernie (Coleen was initially too young) - had been on the music scene since 1974 and went on to become one of the biggest British groups of the late 70s and early 80s.",
      "The Nolans scored seven UK top 20 hits, including their most famous song, which reached number three in 1980.",
      "They also built up a big international following - particularly in Japan. And they went on tour with Frank Sinatra.",
      "Singer Linda Nolan dies aged 65",
      "Singer Linda Nolan dies aged 65",
      "All this came with a sugary disco image and catchy bubblegum songs, also including Spirit, Body and Soul, Don't Make Waves and Don't Love Me Too Hard.",
      "\"For all its formulaic superficial corniness, I'm In The Mood For Dancing is a definite uplifting shiny-minded pop song,\" music journalist Paul Morley told BBC News.",
      "\"[It was] efficiently custom built for parties, Top of the Pops and weddings, and with a longevity you would not have seen coming at the time.\"",
      "'Importance of hard work'",
      "After some line-up changes, Linda left the group in 1983 to pursue a solo career, mainly in musical theatre - and with a good degree of success.",
      "Her most memorable role was in the West End production of Blood Brothers. Then there were regular TV appearances, including a notorious turn on 2014's Celebrity Big Brother, where she came face-to-face with her long-time adversary, comedian Jim Davidson.",
      "But, as the years went on, showbusiness seemed to be overshadowed for Linda and her siblings by a personal and family life marked by turmoil, tragedy and the breakdown of sisterly bonds.",
      "Linda was born in Ireland before her parents Tommy and Maureen Nolan, a husband-and-wife singing duo, moved the family to Blackpool in 1962 in search of work. There were eight Nolan offspring - six girls and two boys. All the girls sang and were performing from an early age.",
      "The Nolan girls found themselves on a treadmill of performances in nightclubs, on TV and on tours. Their fees paid the family bills.",
      "Their father doubled as their manager and would wait in the bar before taking them home in the early hours of a school day.",
      "\"The importance of hard work was drummed into us at an early age,\" Linda told The Telegraph in 2018. \"My attitude has always been that unless I'm on a stretcher, the show must go on.\"",
      "But, as it emerged much later, their father, an alcoholic and womaniser, was sexually abusing his eldest daughter, Anne. He was frequently violent, too. Tommy Nolan died aged 78 in 1998. Anne unloaded her secret in her 2008 autobiography.",
      "\"It must have been difficult for Anne all those years because everybody loved our father, absolutely loved him,\" Linda said in an interview with The Guardian.",
      "\"She must have been seething. People say it was probably cathartic for her to write the book, and I'm sure it was.\"",
      "The girls were \"spotted\" at a Blackpool gig in 1973 and signed a recording contract, but their big break came in 1978 when they got a deal with Epic Sony-CBS.",
      "So began the hits, world tours and regular appearances on TV shows from Top of the Pops to Morecambe and Wise.",
      "The Nolans sold 25 million albums globally but very little of the profits ended up in the girls' pockets, their father having failed to appreciate he could negotiate a bigger pay deal.",
      "In 1979, Linda met Brian Hudson, a former musician, and they married in 1981 despite the reservations of her parents over the 13-year age gap and Brian's history of two divorces. Brian also became The Nolans' tour manager.",
      "\"But when the other girls decided that my husband Brian wasn't right as their tour manager, I was devastated and opted to launch a solo career instead,\" Linda told The Telegraph later.",
      "She left with a cheque for \u00a313,000 - but then a tax bill came in for the same amount.",
      "Linda's solo career, managed by Brian, first saw her make guest appearances on TV and on the tours of such diverse names as Gene Pitney and Cannon and Ball.",
      "She also did her fair share of pantomimes before her musical theatre career kicked off with a part alongside Paul O'Grady in Prisoner Cell Block H: The Musical.",
      "The financial blows flared up again in 1995 when she and Brian were declared bankrupt. They were saved when a newspaper then paid Linda \u00a317,000 to tell her story.",
      "She put their money problems down to the \"feast or famine\" nature of showbiz.",
      "'Stabbed in the back'",
      "In 2000, Linda landed her most successful role, in Willy Russell's Blood Brothers, taking over as Mrs Johnstone from her younger sister Bernie.",
      "But it was also at the start of the 2000s that Linda's world, and that of her family, began to fall apart.",
      "First Anne was told she had breast cancer, then Brian was diagnosed with cancer of the skin. A year later, Linda was told she too had breast cancer.",
      "Anne recovered, and it was while Linda was undergoing treatment that she lost her husband of 26 years, a blow that left her contemplating suicide.",
      "\"He was the love of my life... I lost hope of ever being happy again and started thinking, as people do when they reach a certain point in depression, it would be better for everybody if I wasn't here and I would be doing them a favour,\" she revealed in early 2018.",
      "She was given the all-clear from cancer in 2006 but, too depressed to work, she started claiming benefits.",
      "Then in 2009 came a financial lifeline when Maureen, Linda, Bernie and Coleen were offered the chance of a reunion tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of I'm In The Mood For Dancing.",
      "The tour went well but, on the family front, things turned decidedly sour. Anne declared she had been \"stabbed in the back\" by her siblings.",
      "\"No-one asked me. No-one involved me at all until it was too late. Now they've made it clear I am not wanted,\" she told The Daily Mail.",
      "The sisters claimed the decision had been the record company's and out of their hands. It caused a further rupture in the already fractured family relationship.",
      "Financial blows",
      "But the next year, the sisters attempted to come together to support Bernie, who was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a mastectomy and chemotherapy and was given the all-clear. But in 2012 the cancer returned, leading to her death aged 52.",
      "The sisters' truce came to an end soon afterwards.",
      "In 2014, Linda's financial problems returned when she was investigated by Blackpool council and the Department for Work and Pensions for claiming benefits to the tune of \u00a312,000 while working.",
      "\"I thought I'd stuck to the rules religiously, but some of the things they thought of as 'work' just hadn't occurred to me. I thought working meant doing a stage show, not quick television interviews,\" she told The Telegraph.",
      "She came up with a repayment plan and eventually was issued with a caution.",
      "That same year, Linda went into the Celebrity Big Brother house (reportedly because she needed the money), an experience that led to her telling torrid tales about her sex life and coming to verbal blows with Davidson.",
      "The two had been enemies since the 90s, when Brian had been caught stealing money from Davidson's friend and fellow comedian Frank Carson.",
      "As sister Coleen became a panellist on ITV's Loose Women, Linda also became a regular guest.",
      "And it was on that show in 2017 that a tearful Coleen told viewers her sister's cancer had returned, and this time was terminal.",
      "Linda had resumed her stage work but then, with the second diagnosis, she stopped. In March 2023, she confirmed that the cancer had spread to her brain.",
      "But as she made clear in her autobiography From My Heart - released in 2018 - she refused to spend the time she had left to live \"constantly stressing about cancer\".",
      "She added: \"I've chosen to enjoy the little things. I've chosen to laugh. And I've chosen to look back on my life and thank God for it.\""

      "\"I think what's interesting is although we're sharing the role, we won't actually be working together on Match of the Day,\" she said.",

      "On first MOTD memories",
      "\"Match of the Day was always on - I can't remember a time without it,\" said Cates, who is the daughter of Liverpool and Scotland legend Sir Kenny Dalglish.",
      "\"My earliest memory is of Des Lynam being on it. In fact there's a Scottish version of Match of the Day and I was born just before it came on air, so my dad had time to get home and watch it in the evening. I've always had a good sense of timing when it comes to an evening highlights show!\"",
      "Logan, who is the daughter of former Wales and Leeds midfielder Terry Yorath, said: \"When my dad was playing, it was the only way you could watch football on TV because there were very few live matches.",
      "\"That music would play every Saturday night because he would come home from work - playing in a match - and watch his match on Match of the Day. As a very little girl, hearing that music meant I was staying up late on a Saturday night.\"",
      "Chapman said: \"My first memory of Match of the Day was in 1981 watching Manchester United play Ipswich at Old Trafford in the era when not every game was shown on the programme.",
      "\"I remember Gary Bailey being in goal for Manchester United and saving a penalty with no gloves on. I wanted to go and get in goal in the garden after that. I must have been seven.\"",

      "Look back at the first time Gary Lineker presented Match of the Day",

      "\"It's something that's so well-loved and so well-respected you don't want to be the person that goes in and breaks that,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm just very excited, I can't wait to get started. I keep thinking about that moment I'll be sitting in the chair and the music starts, and I can't wait for it to happen.\"",
      "Chapman said \"in many ways I'm not doing anything different to what I've done for the last 12 years\".",
      "But he added: \"I am excited about the variety that is going to come from the new role.",
      "\"I just can't wait to be working with two friends, where we've grown up working together and we feel like a team. And to have some Sundays off.\"",
      "Logan - a rhythmic gymnast for Great Britain before going into broadcasting - described it as an \"iconic show\".",
      "She added: \"One of the first things I did when I came to the BBC was fill in on Match of the Day and at that point when I was in that chair at the old BBC studio in London and hearing the music, it was a real hairs-on-the-back-of-the-neck moment.",
      "\"It's always a real moment [sitting in the chair] because it has such history and it's still so relevant to so many people now and talked about in a landscape where TV has changed so much.",
      "\"Everybody understands the history of the programme and the consistently huge audiences that watch it. It has more to offer as well - we know how strong the digital offering is and Match of the Day is really relevant to that audience too.",

      "Based on a book by the father of one of the victims, Lockerbie: A Search for Truth focuses on longstanding claims that the only man found guilty of bombing Pan Am 103 was innocent.",
      "The production - which has provoked fierce criticism from relatives of American victims - does not mention that the conviction of Abdulbasset Al Megrahi for murdering 270 people was upheld twice on appeal.",
      "Each episode of the Sky Atlantic series starts with a declaration that it's \"inspired by the work and research\" of Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora was on board Pan Am 103 when it broke apart over Lockerbie in December 1988.",
      "Flora Swire was one of 259 passengers and crew who were killed along with 11 residents in Lockerbie when the wreckage destroyed their homes.",
      "Lockerbie bombing: The ultimate detective story?",
      "Lockerbie dad delighted by Colin Firth portrayal",
      "Lockerbie suspect 'is the bomber' - MacAskill",
      "In 2001, after an eight-month trial, Scottish judges convicted Megrahi of bombing the plane while acting with other members of the Libyan intelligence service.",
      "For more than 20 years, Jim Swire and his supporters have argued that Megrahi and Libya were framed for political expediency.",
      "They believe the real culprits were Iran and a Syrian-backed group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command (PFLP-GC).",
      "Relatives of other victims dismiss that as a baseless conspiracy theory.",
      "Later this year, the case will be examined all over again when another Libyan suspect goes on trial in Washington, accused of building the Lockerbie bomb.",
      "The warnings before the bombing",
      "The controversy over Lockerbie began within days of the tragedy on 21 December 1988.",
      "As the drama recounts, it soon emerged that there had been warnings that a bomb attack on a Pan Am flight was imminent.",
      "Those warnings had not been made public.  The passengers, including a CIA agent, boarded Pan Am 103 without knowing anything about them.",
      "The US president Ronald Reagan said afterwards: \"Such a public statement with nothing more to go on than an anonymous phone call, you would literally have closed down the air traffic in the world.\"",
      "In a BBC documentary in 2008, the government official who took that call at the US embassy in Helsinki described it as a hoax and a \"horrible coincidence\".",
      "But for 36 years, Dr Swire and other UK relatives have called for a public inquiry to examine the warnings and the failures of airline and airport security which allowed the bomb to slip through. As the drama points out, this inquiry has never happened.",
      "Just last week, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney said he could not consider the request while the judicial process in the US was still going on.",
      "The destruction of Pan Am 103 was an attack on the United States. Of the 270 victims, 190 were American. The rest came from 20 other countries, including 43 people from the UK.",
      "Suspicion initially fell on Iran.",
      "Five months before Lockerbie, an American warship shot down an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf after mistaking it for a fighter jet. The 290 men, women and children on board were killed. Iran swore revenge.",
      "In October that year, West German police raided flats in Frankfurt where members of the PFLP-GC were preparing bombs in radio cassette players. They had timetables for airlines, including Pan Am.",
      "Less than two months later, Pan Am 103 was brought down.",
      "A joint Scottish/US investigation established that the bomb had been concealed inside a different model of radio cassette player in a suitcase.",
      "The involvement of the PFLP-GC and Iran made sense, but Scottish police and the FBI say they found no evidence to justify charges against anyone from the group or Iranian officials.",
      "The defence at the Lockerbie trial blamed the Palestinians for the bombing but the judges said they had heard nothing to prove their involvement or undermine their belief that Libya was responsible.",
      "The prosecution case was that the Libyans smuggled the unaccompanied suitcase onto an Air Malta flight to Frankfurt, where it was loaded on to Pan Am 103a, the feeder flight for Pan Am 103. This assertion was supported by baggage records.",
      "The suitcase was transferred onto Pan Am 103 at Heathrow.",
      "Clothes from the suitcase were traced to a shop on Malta. Its owner told the court they were bought by a Libyan who resembled Megrahi, a crucial piece of evidence which has been hotly disputed ever since.",
      "The day before the bombing, Megrahi travelled to Malta using a false passport supplied by the Libyan intelligence service.",
      "He was at Malta airport when luggage was being loaded onto the flight to Frankfurt and flew back to Libya shortly afterwards.  He never used the passport again and later denied being on Malta.",
      "Dr Swire and his supporters remain convinced the US needed to shift the blame from Iran, which was backing groups holding American hostages.",
      "The prosecution did not need to prove a motive at the Lockerbie trial but there was a long history of antagonism between the US and Libya. This culminated in 1986 with the bombing of a Berlin nightclub, which killed two American servicemen, and a retaliatory raid by the US airforce on Tripoli and Benghazi.",
      "That attack killed dozens of people including, it was claimed, the adopted daughter of Libyan leader Muanmar Gaddafi.",
      "Megrahi lost his first appeal against his conviction in 2002 but won a second after a four-year investigation by the independent Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission.",
      "The SCCRC found there was no proper basis in allegations that investigators had manipulated, altered or fabricated evidence to make a case against Megrahi.",
      "But it did conclude the court had no reasonable basis for finding that Megrahi bought the clothes in Malta, undermining a cornerstone of the prosecution case.",
      "The commission said the verdict had been \"unreasonable\" and that Megrahi might have suffered a miscarriage of justice.",
      "The case was sent back to the courts but Megrahi abandoned the appeal after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.",
      "Terminally ill, he was freed on compassionate grounds by the Scottish government in 2009 and died three years later in Tripoli.",
      "In 2020, after a request from Megrahi's family, the SCCRC referred the case back to the appeal court a second time.",
      "Once again, the commission said the trial court should not have accepted that Megrahi bought the clothes that were beside the bomb.",
      "It also said he was denied a fair trial because of non-disclosure; the prosecution didn't give the defence certain information which could have helped him.",
      "Five of Scotland's most senior judges upheld the conviction, saying the identification of Megrahi was just one part of the overall picture and the information which was not disclosed to the defence would not have changed the verdict.",
      "The bomb timer fragment",
      "The single most important piece of evidence from the case was a thumbnail-sized fragment of circuit board, found embedded in the neck band of a shirt from the suitcase that held the bomb.",
      "The trial judges accepted evidence from scientists that it was part of an MST-13 bomb timer sold to Libya by MEBO, a Swiss firm with connections to Megrahi.",
      "Towards the end of the Sky drama, Dr Swire becomes even more convinced of Megrahi's innocence after learning that tests on the fragment showed it had a different coating from the MST-13 timers obtained by Libya.",
      "This evidence was examined by the SCCRC before it sent Megrahi's conviction back to the appeal court in 2020.",
      "It said it was \"not persuaded\" that it called into question the judges' conclusion that the fragment came from an MST-13 timer which triggered the bomb.",
      "The drama tells viewers that the British government used public interest immunity certificates to prevent the disclosure of \"secret intelligence documents allegedly implicating Iran and the PLFP-GC\" and that those documents \"remain classified to this day\".",
      "The certificates were imposed in 2008 and again in 2020, when the UK's foreign secretary said their disclosure would harm the UK's international relations and damage counter-terrorism liason and intelligence gathering.",
      "An independent investigator from the SCCRC was allowed to view the two documents in 2006 and concluded that the prosecution's failure to disclose one of them to the defence might have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.",
      "The matter wasn't dealt with in court because Megrahi abandoned his second appeal.",
      "In 2019, the SCCRC looked at them again. This time it decided one of the documents involved inadmissable hearsay and the second would not have made any difference to the defence, had it known about it.",
      "The appeal court accepted the SCCRC's views and the government's argument that disclosure could harm national security.",
      "The Sky drama informs its audience that some names, scenes and characters have been \"changed or fictionalised for dramatic purposes\".",
      "There are examples of that throughout, including its portrayal of the day of the verdicts at the Lockerbie trial.",
      "Megrahi stood trial alongside another Libyan, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, at Camp Zeist - a specially convened Scottish court in the Netherlands.",
      "The programme ramps up the tension as the judges announce they have found Fhimah not guilty and Megrahi guilty. This prompts jubilation among almost all of the relatives in the court's public gallery, with people leaping to their feet and hugging each other.",
      "A distressed young Libyan woman bangs on a glass partition shouting \"That's my dad!\" as a bewildered Megrahi is sentenced to life in a Scottish prison.",
      "Played by Colin Firth, Dr Swire faints and falls to the floor.",
      "In real life, the judges announced the verdict the other way round. There were gasps and tears but no outbursts of emotion; the atmosphere remained sombre; Megrahi was impassive; no-one banged on the glass.",
      "In a shocking and unforgettable moment, Dr Swire did faint and had to be carried from the courtroom. The sentence was announced later that day.",
      "A group representing relatives of some of the American victims has criticised the Sky drama.",
      "Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 said it \"amplifies falsehoods and unsupported theories; ignores the work of hundreds of family members by focusing on one; disregards the work of investigators and prosecutors; and brings to life, in grotesque detail, the events of 21 December 1988\".",
      "The group continued: \"Worst of all, the series presents a convicted murderer as an innocent man that should be empathized with.\"",
      "Sky said it understood that there were \"opposing opinions\" and that the series did not attempt to tell the definitive version of the Lockerbie disaster or present a conclusion.",
      "\"We do not underestimate the responsibility of telling this story sensitively,\" it added.",
      "\"We engaged with victims' families and support groups throughout production and in the lead up to the series launch.\"",
      "Dr Swire said he hoped the series would cause people to \"have another look at the criminal investigation after Lockerbie.",
      "\"I would like to know the whole truth about my daughter's brutal murder along with those of 269 other people.\"",
      "The second Lockerbie trial",
      "Scotland's Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said the trial had found that the bombing was orchestrated by the Libyan government and that multiple individuals were involved.",
      "\"Megrahi was found guilty and two appeals have upheld that conviction,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "\"Scottish prosecutors are working with their US counterparts to support the current prosecution. The trial in Washington will bring the facts before the public again and the circumstances of what happened can be fully understood.\"",
      "In May, a Libyan man in his 70s will stand trial in Washington, accused of the destruction of a civil aircraft resulting in death.",
      "Abu Agila Masud has denied building the bomb which destroyed Pan Am 103 in a Libyan intelligence operation involving Megrahi and Fhimah.",
      "Prosecutors in Washington are likely to lead evidence from the first trial along with new information gathered in the years that followed.",
      "The defence will be armed with all the counter arguments from Megrahi's legal teams and the SCCRC's doubts over the safety of his conviction.",
      "In addition to the Sky series, a BBC/Netflix drama on Lockerbie is also due to be screened later this year, focusing on the joint Scottish/US investigation.",
      "More than 36 years after the tragedy, the controversy surrounding the deadliest terror attack in British history shows no sign of fading away.",
      "David Cowan and presenter Kaye Adams, who reported from Lockerbie on the night of the disaster, will discuss the story with Martin Geissler on BBC News Scotland's new podcast, Scotcast. The episode will be available on BBC Sounds at 17:00 on Wednesday and broadcast on the BBC Scotland channel at 23:00."

      "And how much did it cost to bring in Banksy?",

      "But Molly-Mae appeared on Love Island at the peak of its popularity. The episode in which she and Tommy Fury lost out to winners Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea is still the show's most watched ever, attracting over six million viewers.",
      "Hitting these heights isn't possible for every former cast member, something more recent contestant Tanyel Revan believes aspiring influencers need to be aware of.",
      "\"One thing about this industry that people have to remember is that if you don't maintain it 24/7, which is very hard because it is a bit of a fake lifestyle, you can easily be forgotten,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I think a lot of influencers go back on All Stars because they need to keep up and have that boost,\" she adds.",
      "Tanyel, 28, appeared on a winter series of the show in 2023, when interest was still high (its final was watched by over a million people), but not at the levels Molly-Mae experienced in 2019.",
      "The hairdresser says while she has earned some \"extra income\" from social media influencing, the haircare company she started before entering the villa is what gives her \"stability\".",
      "\"I am a businesswoman who has got my own salon,\" Tanyel adds.",
      "'It's very saturated'",
      "A lot has changed since Love Island first aired in its current form in 2015. More than 300 people have now appeared on the UK edition of the show - being an ex-Islander is no longer an exclusive club.",
      "For a while, finalists enjoyed rumoured six-figure brand deals with fast fashion companies and sponsored Instagram posts that could earn them thousands.",
      "But according to social media expert and co-founder of Sloane House Marketing, Bryleigh Flack, the appetite for this type of content no longer exists.",
      "\"The way we digest content is completely different to how we did even five years ago,\" she says.",
      "\"There are so many adverts, not even just influencer ads but when you are scrolling, even through your friends' [Instagram] stories, you're hit with them, it's very saturated,\" she says.",
      "Bryleigh says big-brand partnerships used to be the best way to make money, but \"appealing to the masses\" is no longer the best strategy for influencers, thanks to newer platforms like TikTok, which use a different algorithm to choose content for users.",
      "She says there is a new type of content creator in 2025 - the \"micro influencer\" - who may not have loads of followers, but has a really engaged and specific audience.",
      "These creators \"really hone in on their audience and know them\", she adds. \"For example, mums with young families or girls that love to go out every weekend, they're completely different people so trying to market to them both won't work.\"",
      "'Just being good looking is not going to get you much'",
      "Billy Brown, who appeared on series eight of Love Island in 2022, says many of the people he was on the show with saw it as an easy route to becoming an influencer.",
      "\"I know a lot of people who came out, quit their job and thought that's it now, but it's not.",
      "\"You can earn a lot of money from that show but if you don't do well, it's not the case,\" says the 25-year-old, who entered the main villa after impressing fellow contestant Tasha Ghouri in second villa Casa Amor.",
      "Billy, who owns businesses in construction and property development, says that days after leaving the show, he was \"getting up at half four in the morning [for work] and then going to a movie premiere at night\".",
      "\"I didn't let it get to my head, I think I was one of the only people who could say 'look, it's not all glitz and glam',\" he adds.",
      "Billy has maintained a social media presence in the years since, featuring content on his construction work alongside more lifestyle and sports-focused material.",
      "He says he still earns some money from influencing but thinks that's due to his personality, rather than his follower count, a relatively modest 115,000. In contrast, Molly-Mae has over eight million.",
      "\"People [who go on the show] need to focus on what they like, instead of just being known for being on Love Island.",
      "\"You have to have something about you, just being good looking is not going to get you much,\" he adds.",
      "'People would do adverts for every single company'",
      "Love Island's cultural relevance has become a topic of conversation in recent years due to falling viewing figures.",
      "At the show's peak in 2019, it achieved an average of nearly six million viewers, with more recent series in 2023 and 2024 attracting around one to two million.",
      "With the reality TV dating genre's recent boost from Netflix shows such as Love is Blind, The Ultimatum and Too Hot to Handle, audiences now have more options than ever at their disposal.",
      "Jake Lee, who runs Alpha Talent Group, represents stars from across sport, entertainment and social media.",
      "He manages boxer Tommy Fury and sports presenter Mac Griffiths (known as Michael on Love Island), who both appeared on the aforementioned 2019 series of the show.",
      "\"People would come off a show and do adverts for every single company, because these companies would want to take advantage of the quick exposure they could get,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"But four or five months down the line you'd be harming your own career, because you'd used your platform the wrong way and there'd be no credibility there,\" he adds.",

      "Jack Saunders, who hosts Radio 1's New Music show, said: \"No one deserves this accolade more than Chappell Roan. She was the most exciting artist of the last 12 months and is now set to be the artist of the next 12 months.\"",

      "But by that stage, she had already recorded a song that would become her calling card.",
      "Titled Pink Pony Club, it was inspired by a visit to an LA gay club, and helped her define a new sound - camp, liberated and packed with singalong choruses.",
      "The experience also spawned her campy stage persona, which she has described as a \"larger-than-life, drag queen version of myself\".",
      "After finding a new record label, she released her debut album, The Rise And Fall Of A Midwest Princess, in September 2023.",

      "More importantly, the show was broadcast on YouTube - going viral after Roan  leaned into the TV cameras and declared: \"I'm your favourite artist's favourite artist.\" The performance has subsequently been watched more than a million times.",
      "Around the same time, she released a stand-alone single called Good Luck, Babe, that talked about her experience of falling in love with her best friend.",

      "\"And it's like, 'Sure, OK. Your time will come.'\"",
      "The single eventually reached number two in the UK charts, and The Rise And Fall Of The Midwest Princess became a number one album after it was re-released on vinyl last summer.",
      "Since then, Roan has been nominated for six Grammy awards, including album of the year, and won best new artist at the Billboard Music Awards in December.",

      "\"Fifteen minutes before the gig, I made the horrific mistake of reading the wall backstage,\" he says.",

      "If they were intimidated, it didn't show. The quintet turn audience participation into an artform, venturing out into the crowd and making fans part of their ensemble, almost like a New Orleans parade.",

      "\"There's a lot of things in the world that don't feel real enough, but music shouldn't be one of them.\"",
      "In contrast to its predecessor, the album is immersed in the real world. Themed around a night out in London, it celebrates the sacred power of dancing and losing yourself in music with other people.",

      "Anyone who's braved one of those 3am rides home will recognise the song's mixture of post-club euphoria, random conversations and the backdrop of potential violence.",

      "\"Our school got one of those fancy little boats on the Thames and everyone paid their \u00a320, which, for a state school in Enfield, was an impressive night out,\" he recalls.",

    "story": [
      "Calling people obese is medically \"flawed\" - and the definition should be split into two, a report from global experts says.",
      "The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease.",
      "This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity.",
      "More than a billion people are estimated to be living with obesity worldwide and prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand.",
      "The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.",
      "\"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said.",
      "\"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added.",
      "The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says.",
      "'I feel blessed to get weight-loss jab' - but can the NHS afford it for all?",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight.",
      "\"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell.",
      "\"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me.",
      "\"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said.",
      "Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI.",

      "In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet.",
      "\"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\"",
      "Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as having a BMI over 30 - a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight.",
      "How is BMI calculated?",
      "It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.",
      "For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in):",
      "square their height in metres: 1.70 x 1.70 = 2.89divide their weight in kilograms by this amount: 70 \u00f7 2.89 = 24.22display the result to one decimal place: 24.2",

      "display the result to one decimal place: 24.2",
      "Find out what your body mass index (BMI) means on the NHS website",
      "But BMI has limitations.",
      "It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat.",
      "So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat.",
      "The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese.",
      "But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs.",
      "Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says.",
      "\"Obesity is a health risk - the difference is it's also an illness for some,\" Prof Rubino said.",
      "What are the two groups?",
      "Clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a disease, there will be signs of it affecting organs in the body - through heart disease, breathlessness, type 2 diabetes or joint pain - and a person's day-to-day activities. Treatment with drugs or surgery is likely.",
      "Pre-clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a risk to health - but not yet causing any illnesses, people should be offered weight-loss advice, counselling and monitoring, to reduce the chances of health problems developing.",
      "Doctors should also pay close attention to a patient's family history to see if they are at risk of particular diseases.",
      "At a time when drugs that reduce body weight by up to 20% are being prescribed on a large scale, the report says redefining obesity \"is all the more relevant\" because it \"improves the accuracy of diagnosis\".",
      "Access to weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro is often restricted to patients with a BMI over 30 and a weight-related health condition.",
      "Children's obesity expert Prof Louise Baur, from the University of Sydney, who contributed to the report, said the new approach would allow adults and children with obesity \"to receive more appropriate care\", while reducing the numbers being over-diagnosed and given unnecessary treatment.",
      "The Royal College of Physicians said the report laid a strong foundation \"for treating obesity with the same medical rigour and compassion as other chronic illnesses\".",

      "Lead researcher Dr Rosie McNee told the BBC: \"Something that really needs scrutiny is the surge in the use of ehealth, including fertility apps and period trackers.",
      "\"The market has exploded. There are hundreds of them and some are more reliable than others. Plus you don't need a prescription, and so you may not get all the information you need.\"",
      "She said some tracking apps are designed to track periods rather than fertility or family planning.",
      "Abortion provider MSI Reproductive Choices UK told the BBC it too has seen more women using fertility awareness methods.",
      "Tanya Lane, contraception lead, explained: \"This could be a result of the rise in popularity of social media platforms like TikTok, which has seen more people sharing their experiences...and content creators doing paid partnerships with brands of fertility awareness methods that might be influencing people to choose this option.",
      "Long waits for appointments at GP surgeries and sexual health clinics could also be a factor.",
      "\"People are waiting months for appointments in some areas of the UK, especially for long-acting methods like the coil and implant.\"",
      "She said that any woman thinking of switching to fertility tracking should speak to a medical professional.",
      "Dr Melanie Davis-Hall, Medical Director at women's health review platform The Lowdown, said: \"The key here is to reduce the spread of misinformation and the use of apps and methods that are not approved fertility awareness methods so people know they are equivalent to not using contraception. Then we need to address why people are ditching hormonal and non hormonal contraception and the role the spread of misinformation plays in this.\"",
      "Paula Baraitser, medical director of the NHS-partnered free sexual health service provider SH:24, said there could be many reasons why women are switching, including concerns about future fertility and possible side effects.",
      "The risks can range from mild side effects to rare but potentially serious complications.",
      "She told the BBC: \"Many people will use contraception for 30 years of their lives.",
      "\"People's experience of hormonal contraception is highly variable and ultimately we need a larger choice of methods to enable people to find one that suits them.",
      "\"There have been few new methods of contraception in the last 50 years, reflecting a lack of investment in research in this area.\"",
      "The sexual health charity Brook said many women use hormonal contraception not simply to prevent pregnancy, but to manage their menstrual health, to make periods lighter and more predictable.",
      "\"These benefits need to be part of the wider conversation about hormones,\" said spokeswoman Lisa Hallgarten."

      "The government has confirmed plans to reintroduce a piece of legislation aimed at protecting free speech on university campuses.",
      "The Higher Education Freedom of Speech Act, which proposed fines for universities failing to uphold freedom of speech, was passed under the previous, Conservative government in 2023.",
      "But its implementation was stopped shortly after Labour's election win last summer over concerns the law was potentially damaging to student welfare.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told Parliament the government would be progressing with the legislation but with significant changes.",
      "The act said universities had a duty to \"secure\" and \"promote the importance\" of freedom of speech and academic expression.",
      "It included controversial new powers in which the regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), would have been able to fine or sanction higher education providers and student unions in England.",
      "A new complaints scheme for students, staff and visiting speakers was also included. They could seek compensation if they suffered from a breach of a university's free-speech obligations.",
      "However, last July the education secretary paused the law days before it was due to come into force, over fears it could protect people using hate speech on campuses and expose universities to expensive legal action.",
      "At the time, a government source told the BBC the legislation would have opened the way for Holocaust deniers to be allowed on campus, and was an \"antisemite charter\".",
      "Phillipson told Parliament in July that the delay would allow time to consider whether the law would be repealed.",
      "Having spent the last six months considering what to do, the act is now being brought back.",
      "Issuing fines",
      "In a statement, Phillipson said academic freedom was \"much more important than the wishes of some students not to be offended\".",

      "It could result in long and costly legal battles, at a time when many universities were already struggling financially, the government said.",
      "There will also no longer be direct responsibility on student unions under the law, though Phillipson said they would still be expected to support free speech and held to account by their university.",
      "The National Union of Students welcomed the announcement, saying the threat of complex legal responsibilities was no longer hanging over them.",
      "The OfS would retain powers to investigate alleged breaches of free speech under the law, the government said, as well as issuing fines.",
      "Shadow education secretary Laura Trott described the changes as a \"wrecking ball\" to the policy, and questioned what the consequences would be for universities alleged to have breached their free speech duties with the threat of legal action removed.",

      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents 140 higher education providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day that academic freedom and freedom of speech were \"essential\" to universities and she was glad the legislation was coming back.",

      "He says the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\".",

      "Housing minister Matthew Pennycook confirmed the addition of a clause to stop landlords making upfront charges in the Commons on Tuesday.",
      "Landlord groups have warned the move could leave property owners open to risk if tenants have no other way of proving their ability to pay rent on an ongoing basis.",

      "Charities warn bill doesn't protect renters enough",

      "Tenants who were \"perfectly able to afford the monthly rent\" were being asked to give landlords \"ever larger sums\" in advance, he said, or \"risk being locked out of renting altogether\".",
      "The latest move comes on top of existing measures intended to stop bidding wars for homes where \"often desperate tenants are pitted against each other so that landlords are able to extract the highest possible payment they can\"..",
      "Shadow housing minister David Simmonds said the bill had \"many shortcomings\" and would create \"concerns around the availability, and the affordability of accommodation in the private rented sector\".",

      "Labour's Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who is a renter and the MP for Clapham and Brixton Hill, said rent rises should be capped because \"I'm yet to hear a compelling reason why landlords should see their incomes grow faster than people who actually work for a living\".",
      "And former Labour leader Corbyn suggested evictions were happening before protections could be introduced, saying \"there seems to be quite a lot of landlords at the present time who are using unreasonable arguments in order to terminate tenancies or raise rents ahead of this legislation coming in\".",
      "Pennycook acknowledged there was \"a lot of bad practice in the sector\" that the government was keen to clamp down on, and acknowledged the potential for \"retaliatory economic no-fault evictions\" in the interim period.",
      "However, he drew the line at rent controls, saying there was evidence the measure could harm tenants.",
      "\"Once Section 21 [\"no-fault\"] evictions are done away with, unscrupulous landlords will no doubt attempt to evict tenants who assert their rights by means of extortionate rent rises,\" he said.",
      "However, he added, \"the government sincerely believe that the introduction of rent controls in the private rented sector could harm tenants as well as landlords as a result of reduced supply, and discourage investment\".",
      "Polly Neate, the chief executive of housing charity Shelter, welcomed the new cap on advance payments - but urged the government to go further on controlling rent rises.",

      "A government source said Ms Pitcher had \"jumped as she was pushed\", as the prime minister had received an independent recommendation to advise the King to remove her from office.",
      "Last summer, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood began the formal process of sending a recommendation to the King that Ms Pitcher should go, after personally concluding that she was not fit to head the CCRC.",
      "That decision came after a damning independent report into how the CCRC had mishandled Mr Malkinson's pleas for help, and how the chair herself had presented its work on his case.",

      "He came back with 50 recommendations which are now being implemented.",

      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",

    "story": [
      "The father of Molly Russell, the teenager who took her own life after seeing harmful content online, has personally appealed to the prime minister to tighten rules that protect children and has warned the UK is \"going backwards\" on internet safety.",
      "Ian Russell, who backed the previous government bringing in new requirements for tech firms in the Online Safety Act, calls the way the regulator Ofcom is implementing the rules a \"disaster\".",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer on Saturday, seen by the BBC, Mr Russell says there is \"widespread dismay\" among bereaved families who have fought for tougher protections, and that more young people have lost their lives because of \"dither and delay\".",
      "And he warns that without tougher actions, \"the streams of life-sucking content seen by children will soon become torrents: a digital disaster driven by the actions of tech firms, and being left unchallenged by a failing regulatory model\".",
      "\"This preventable harm would be happening on your watch,\" he writes to Sir Keir.",
      "The Online Safety Act, introduced last year, is designed to force tech firms to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms and protect children from some legal-but-harmful material. Ofcom decides the specific guidelines that companies must follow.",
      "Safety campaigners believe there are significant loopholes in Ofcom's code on illegal content, including a lack of specific rules on live streaming or content that promotes suicide and self-harm. And the new codes of practice, which are still being worked on, won't apply to private messaging.",
      "An Ofcom spokesperson said: \"We recognise the profound pain caused by harmful content online, and our deepest sympathies remain with Ian Russell and all those who have suffered unimaginable loss.\" They said the voices of victims \"will continue to be at the heart of our work\".",
      "The spokesperson added that tech firms are required to assess the risks of illegal harms on their platforms by 16 March, and after that companies would need measures to reduce the risk of illegal content appearing and to remove it quickly when it appears.",
      "\"In the coming months, as our enforcement powers commence, platforms will face further obligations to protect children from harmful content, even where it is not illegal,\" they said.",
      "What is the Online Safety Act and how can you keep children safe online?",
      "What is the Online Safety Act and how can you keep children safe online?",
      "In his letter, Mr Russell also says Elon Musk, who is the boss of X, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg are part of a \"wholesale recalibration\" of the online world, moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\".",
      "\"In this bonfire of digital ethics and online safety features, all of us will lose, but our children lose the most,\" he writes.",
      "And in an exclusive interview, Mr Russell told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that Meta's platforms, Facebook and Instagram, were turning \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to and therefore more children will be exposed to in the future\".",
      "\"And by turning the platforms backwards away from safety, Mark Zuckerberg has changed the game fundamentally and shown that the platforms aren't really here to play safe, they're here to make money,\" he said. Zuckerberg announced this week that Meta was abandoning the use of independent fact checkers on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told the BBC that there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and that the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "\"We want young people to have safe and age-appropriate experiences on our apps - this has not changed,\" they said.",
      "Mr Russell called on the government to both bolster the Online Safety Act and to introduce extra legislation designed to tackle what he describes as \"the reckless behaviours of social media leadership\".",
      "He also said that he thought there was \"no real movement\" within government. \"The online safety push has stagnated,\" he said. \"In fact, we're probably heading backwards because the tech platforms have changed the way they're playing the game.\"",
      "He said he was sure Sir Keir \"is a father who protects his children from online dangers as much as any individual can\".",
      "\"But as a prime minister, he needs to really back online safety and move forward so that the UK is the safest place in the world to be online,\" he added.",
      "A No 10 spokesperson said Sir Keir was thankful for Mr Russell's letter: \"Ian Russell, alongside many other families and parents, has shown immense bravery through the most tragic of circumstances to campaign for children's online safety. We are grateful for all their contributions and will continue to work with them to get this right.",
      "\"This government is committed to ensuring online safety for children. Social media platforms must step up to their responsibilities and take robust action to protect children from seeing harmful content on their sites.\"",
      "Mr Russell's daughter Molly took her own life in November 2017 after being exposed to a stream of dark, depressing content on Pinterest and Instagram. He has been campaigning for online safety measures since his daughter's death.",
      "You can read his letter in full at the bottom of this story.",
      "Ian Russell's voice hard for Starmer to ignore",
      "No one watching or listening to Mr Russell over the years could deny his passion for change or his deep knowledge of the dark world that Molly was caught up in. Along with other bereaved parents we have met in the past couple of years - including Esther Ghey, Judy Thomas, and Mariano Janin - he has told his family's story with huge dignity, and for a simple reason: he doesn't want anyone else to go through the pain.",
      "He's become a prominent campaigner on an issue that is important to millions of parents and young people around the country. His voice is hard for the government to ignore.",
      "But creating and then imposing rules on the online world is difficult for politicians for many reasons.",
      "The Online Safety Act weathered many controversies and took years to put together. On one side were campaigners concerned about providing protection, on the other, fierce lobbying from the tech companies against straying into censorship or invading people's privacy.",
      "Ofcom was picked to police the rules and could theoretically be incredibly tough, threatening fines of millions of pounds or even prison for those companies that break them. But the new codes of practice are not yet fully in force.",
      "But campaigners like Mr Russell believe it's already obvious the rules fall short. The Internet Watch Foundation boss, Derek Ray-Hill, also told us: \"Unless Ofcom is more ambitious in its interpretation of the Act, so many of the things the legislation makes possible will remain frustratingly out of reach.\"",
      "There is a sense in Whitehall of \"wait and see\". Ministers have acknowledged that as technology advances, extra laws might be required. The Home Office is expected in the next couple of weeks to outline new offences to tackle child abuse online. But the government is also nervous about making rules so tight that tech companies feel unwelcome.",
      "This weekend we'll be joined by the Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, who is determined to make the UK a good place for big tech companies to do business, to help the economy grow. From Sunday onwards he will spell out how artificial intelligence can speed up government business and improve our public services \u2013 this government, like Rishi Sunak's, believes AI can boost the UK's sagging productivity.",
      "But the advance of those technologies bring risks, and tricky decisions for ministers.",
      "Warnings that advanced AI could wipe out thousands of jobs; concerns over deepfake video in pornography, child abuse, or misinformation. Even Paul McCartney and Kate Bush have got the government in their sights as they campaign to try to protect artists' work being used without payment by giant AI platforms, upending decades of copyright law.",
      "Multiple sources familiar with government discussions on child safety and other aspects of this massive quandary say they are concerned the Department of Science and Technology (DSIT) is not paying enough attention to the possible downsides.",
      "A government source said some discussions about protecting people online had been \"spicy\". \"This is a form of harm. It's normal for departments like Home Office and Department of Health to be constantly reviewing what's going on to keep up with safety \u2013 [DSIT] is not yet used to having to doing the same.\"",
      "A source at DSIT said the department had already acknowledged there might have to be more legislation in future but highlighted the fact that the Ofcom codes aren't yet completed or in force.",
      "And a spokesperson said: \"Bereaved parents have suffered the most unimaginable loss, and we are prepared to use every lever at our disposal to improve online safety for children.",
      "\"Changes coming into force through the Online Safety Act will ensure platforms have to act to protect children from harmful online content, with Ofcom ready to enforce these new laws from March. They have our complete backing to use the full range of their powers to root harmful material from the internet, and we expect platforms to be acting now to prepare for these changes.\"",
      "These aren't new arguments. But Musk's trolling of the UK government and Zuckerberg's flex away from fact checking have shifted the ground on which the conversations are taking place.",
      "Ministers have to consider what's right for the economy as well as protecting the public. And they might not want to admit it, but no politician wants to pick a fight with billionaires with massive social media megaphones - or indeed be seen to curtail our liberties or privacy without good reason. Arguably that is why measures like the Online Safety Act took so long to introduce in the first place.",
      "The palpable fear from campaigners like Mr Russell is that just as technology has been speeding up, hard-fought moves to put safety first have been slowing down.",

      "The letter in full",
      "Dear Prime Minister,",
      "Six months ago, you were elected on a platform that promised an end to short-term sticking plaster solutions. I am writing to you as a bereaved father and online safety campaigner because it is evident that urgent action is required to protect young people from the horrors they are routinely exposed to online.",
      "It's now over seven years since the death of my youngest daughter Molly. More than ever before, I am convinced that strong and effective online safety regulation is the most powerful tool available to prevent the loss of ever more young lives at the hands of social media platforms whose indifference to children's safety is fundamentally baked into their commercial strategies, business models and products.",
      "However, in recent months it has become clear that progress towards online safety has stalled \u2013 and we are now going backwards. Regulation as it is currently designed is failing to deliver the protection that children and parents need, want and deserve. No one can credibly claim that Ofcom's implementation of the Online Safety Act is anything other than a disaster \u2013 a view not only shared widely by civil society but also increasingly privately shared across many parts of your Government.",
      "Ofcom's choices when implementing the Act have starkly highlighted intrinsic structural weaknesses with the legislative framework. We not only have a regulator which has fundamentally failed to grasp the urgency and scale of its mission, but a regulatory model that inherently and significantly constrains its ability to reduce preventable harms.",
      "While I understand that this is legislation you inherited and did not design, the reality is that unless you now commit to act decisively to fix the Online Safety Act, the streams of life-sucking content seen by children will soon become torrents: a digital disaster driven by the actions of tech firms, and being left unchallenged by a failing regulatory model. This preventable harm would be happening on your watch.",
      "At the same time as the UK's overdue regulation is falling badly short, the very industry being regulated is ominously changing. The Online Safety Act was developed around a premise that large tech firms would increasingly accept their responsibilities, and we would see safer social networks develop over time.",
      "However, this is a time when platforms readily say they will now 'catch less of the bad stuff'; allow underdeveloped AI to generate and spread disinformation; and promote targeted and polarising content leading to isolation and despair. We have now entered a different era, and we will need a different regulatory approach that can address it.",
      "Put simply, people like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry. We should be in absolutely no doubt that when Zuckerberg speaks about a 'cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech', he is signalling a profound strategic shift away from fundamental safety measures towards a laissez-faire, anything goes model. In this bonfire of digital ethics and online safety features, all of us will lose, but our children lose the most.",
      "It's on that basis that I now encourage you to act swiftly and decisively to address this coming flood of preventable harm. In the immediate term, that means strengthening the existing framework. Beyond that, it means committing to substantially strengthened regulatory model \u2013 with primary legislation being introduced as soon as possible to enact its provisions.",
      "It is not just a new Online Safety Act that is required, but a wholesale re-imagining of the framework to ensure it is capable of responding to the threats of today and beyond. A new framework must be fundamentally oriented towards tackling the reckless behaviours of social media leadership \u2013 a goal which can best be achieved through establishing an overarching Duty of Care supported by a robust set of conduct-based rules to enforce it.",
      "A bolstered OSA must have harm reduction at its core. That means having a clear harm reduction duty on Ofcom, transparency and safety-by-design as integral components of the regulatory regime, and a regulatory design that puts victims at its core \u2013 a major failure of the current regime, where the asymmetry between the interests of victims and industry has if anything been substantially reinforced. The voices of those with lived experience must be heard clearly if big tech's powerful players are not to shout them down in this debate.",
      "Crucially, this must also mean an extension of the Duty of Candour to extend to tech firms. This vital measure stands to correct the historic injustices faced by so many victims, and the power of this measure to address the cultural issues driving harms in the tech sector \u2013 and the asymmetry between industry and victims which perpetuates further harm \u2013 would be considerable.",
      "Too many parents have lost hope that governments will deliver the online safety reform they urgently need. Among bereaved families, there is widespread dismay that successive governments have chosen to dither and delay when the consequences of inaction has been further lost lives.",
      "As Prime Minister and as a father, I implore you to act. You now have a profound opportunity, but also a great responsibility, to act clearly and decisively and to show to millions of parents across this country that meaningful change is on the way. It is time to decisively protect children and young adults from the perils of our online world.",

      "They met and married in London, and later moved their family - Siddiq has an elder brother and a younger sister - to Hampstead.",

      "As a child, she met Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton and Mother Teresa, and her family were invited to the White House.",
      "Her maternal grandfather was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first president. He and most of his family were assassinated when soldiers stormed their home in Dhaka in a military coup in 1975.",
      "Siddiq's mother and aunt survived because they were abroad.",
      "Siddiq joined the Labour Party at the age of 16, later giving the NHS and the care her disabled father as the main reason.",
      "She named former cabinet minister Barbara Castle as her political heroine, and has described her mother and maternal aunt as \"two very strong feminists\".",
      "Pre-politics, she worked for Amnesty International, Save The Children and the Greater London Authority, among others.",

      "Musk hasn't explained his reasoning, but Farage said the pair had a disagreement because Musk wanted Reform to \"come out strongly in support\" of Tommy Robinson.",
      "Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is currently serving an 18-month prison sentence for contempt of court.",
      "The former head of the far-right English Defence League admitted in court to breaching an injunction against repeating claims about a Syrian refugee schoolboy after losing a 2021 libel case.",
      "Farage left his former party UKIP in 2018 saying its association with Robinson had brought \"scuffles\" and \"violence\" to the party.",
      "He has ruled out Robinson being allowed to join Reform UK.",
      "Party members at the event at Sandown talk seriously about electoral success, and while many express sympathy for Robinson, they understand why he might be politically unpalatable.",
      "\"Whatever happens with Tommy, his heart is in the right place but he will never be forgiven by the mainstream media,\" says Kevin Burrell.",

      "She says she is a realist and acknowledges that Reform might \"disappear into the wilderness\" but for now she says it is \"the only party that gives me hope to go out in the morning\".",
      "As the evening progresses, news emerges about the 10 Reform UK councillors in Derbyshire who resigned, arguing the party was being run in an \"increasingly autocratic manner\" and had \"lost its sense of direction\" since Farage took over.",

      "And there is little public sign of discontent with Farage, although one member whispers his unease.",

      "Reform UK was originally called the Brexit Party but these days Brexit only gets a few mentions.",
      "The big themes include opposition to net-zero policies, support for a national inquiry into grooming gangs, the economy and the possible postponement of local elections in May.",
      "More than half of the county councils due to have elections could ask ministers to delay the ballots, following a major shake-up of local government.",
      "Earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said it would be \"ludicrous\" to hold elections for councils that were due to be reorganised.",
      "However, the subject has infuriated Reform UK members, many of whom hope the May elections could see the party make electoral gains.",
      "Blogger Liza Martin-Pope says it is why she decided to attend the conference this evening adding: \"I'm missing my dancing for this.\"",

      "They are new members, new to politics and Caroline says she puts the chances of Farage being prime minister after the next election at 10 out of 10.",
      "The party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour, says Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common, with ratings up from around 15 to 20%. But a general election is years away.",
      "Whether the party can go from five MPs in 2024 to government remains to be seen, but whatever happens, it's clear there are party members still enthused by Reform's offer."

      "Government borrowing costs have been steadily rising in recent months, and have now hit their highest levels for several years.",
      "Why is this happening and how does it affect you?",
      "What's happening in the bond markets?",
      "A bond is a bit like an IOU that can be traded in the financial markets.",
      "Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors.",
      "As well as eventually paying back the value of the bond, governments pay interest at regular intervals so investors receive a stream of future payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. They are mainly bought by financial institutions, such as pension funds.",
      "Interest rates - known as the yield -  on government bonds have been going up since around August.",
      "The yield on a 10-year bond has surged to its highest level since 2008, while the yield on a 30-year bond is at its highest since 1998, meaning it costs the government more to borrow over the long term.",
      "The pound has also fallen in value against the dollar over the past few days. On 7 January it was worth $1.25 but it has now fallen to just above $1.21.",
      "Why are bond yields rising?",
      "Yields are rising not just in the UK. Borrowing costs have also been going up in the US, Japan, Germany and France, for instance.",
      "There is a great deal of uncertainty around what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House later this month. He has pledged to bring in tariffs on goods entering the US and to cut taxes.",
      "Investors worry that this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as they had expected.",
      "But in the UK there are also concerns about the economy underperforming.",
      "Inflation is at its highest for eight months - hitting 2.6% in November - above the Bank of England's 2% target - while the economy has shrunk for two months in a row.",
      "Analysts say it is these wider concerns about the strength of the economy that is driving down the pound, which typically rises when borrowing costs increase.",
      "However, the dollar is also rising against all currencies - not just the pound.",
      "The US economy created more jobs than forecast last month which has added to expectations that US rates will remain higher than previously forecast, and this has helped to push up the value of the dollar.",
      "How does it affect me?",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that all day-to-day spending should be  funded from taxes, not from borrowing.",
      "But if she needs more money to pay back higher borrowing costs, that uses up more tax revenue, leaving less money to spend on other things.",
      "Economists have warned that this could mean spending cuts which would affect public services, and tax rises that could hit people's pay or businesses' ability to grow and hire more people.",
      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",
      "So if higher borrowing costs persist, we may be more likely to see cuts to spending before that or at least lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "Some people may be wondering about the impact of higher gilt yields on the mortgage market, particularly after what happened after Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022.",
      "Although yields are higher now than they were then, they have been creeping up slowly over a period of months, whereas in 2022 they shot up over a couple of days.",
      "That speedy rise led to lenders quickly pulling deals while they tried to work out what interest rate to charge.",
      "Analysts and brokers say the current unease in the markets is having some effect on the pricing of mortgages. Many were expecting to see some falls in rates at the start of the year but instead lenders are holding off from cuts to see what happens.",
      "However, the market is favourable to anyone currently buying an annuity - a product from an insurance company that gives a retirement income for the rest of their life, bought only once.",
      "One annuity expert told the BBC many people would get a better deal now than at any time since 2008, because annuity rates usually move in line with gilt yields.",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "What happens next?",
      "The Treasury has said there is no need for an emergency intervention in the financial markets.",
      "It has said it will not make any spending or tax announcements ahead of the official borrowing forecast from its independent watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), due on 26 March.",
      "If the OBR says the chancellor is still on track to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules then that might settle the markets.",
      "However, if the OBR were to say because of slower growth and higher-than-expected interest rates, the chancellor were likely to break her fiscal rules then that would potentially be a problem for Reeves.",

      "Remember too Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are the duo that best personify the Labour project of the 2020s; the party's revival and return, grounded in being trusted on the economy.",
      "And yet the markets are collectively passing a verdict on Starmer and Reeves's economic plan right now and it isn't exactly a ringing endorsement \u2013 and wobbly markets can prompt political wobbles.",
      "These shouldn't be overstated, but neither should they be ignored.",
      "What we're witnessing is the brutal slog of government playing out; an unforgiving backdrop of economic flatlining, which critics say ministers have made worse.",

      "Cue a number of excitable headlines before Downing Street said it did indeed intend to keep Reeves in post as chancellor for the rest of this parliament.",
      "Folk in No 10 regarded the exchanges as absurd, given how close Starmer and Reeves have been for years and how intertwined their political fates are.",
      "They each have to hope that the markets settle down, that the cost of government borrowing falls and so the prospect of very difficult decisions recede.",

      "The prime minister has a zeal to harness its opportunities.",
      "You bet he has, you might think: perhaps he can get more for less from public services with whizzy computers doing things better and quicker, or so the theory goes, than human beings.",
      "Perhaps too, as many expect, it will revolutionise the economy \u2013 as well as everything else \u2013 transforming productivity and boosting economic growth.",

      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",

      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending. A \u00a310bn cut will hurt, but with a majority of 170 MPs in the House of Commons, and an ongoing spending review already in train, it can be done.",
      "In these circumstances, with the credible threat of a global trade war, for example, it should be noted that Rachel Reeves' new fiscal rules do have an escape hatch.",
      "In the event of \"an emergency or a significant negative economic shock to the economy\" the chancellor may \"temporarily suspend the fiscal mandate\".",
      "While a global trade war could qualify, it would be difficult optics to suspend a \"non-negotiable\" and \"iron-clad\" set of rules before they had really bitten. The rules have not yet formally passed into law yet either, and remain a \"draft\" until the Commons votes to approve them.",
      "It seems very unlikely that this route will be taken unless there is a very clear economic shock in the coming weeks.",
      "The bigger point here is what matters in the markets, which is whether the UK is pursuing a credible set of policies, a convincing overall strategy.",
      "Labour's focus on stability at all costs was understandable after the humiliation of Liz Truss's mini-Budget. But \"stability\" is not a growth strategy.",
      "Pursuing green growth by borrowing for long-term capital investment is a potential strategy, and it underpinned \"Bidenomics\" in the US. The incoming government embraced the rhetoric of US policy under the outgoing president, without the same firepower. \"Bidenomics without the money\", you might say.",

      "BBC Verify's analysis shows Kensington and Chelsea, a London borough, has been given a target of 5,107 new homes every year for the next five years. But the borough delivered an average of only 236 net additional dwellings between 2021-22 and 2023-24.",
      "It did, however, approve 89% of planning applications for housing in the year to June 2024, considerably higher than the national rate of 71%.",
      "Portsmouth, on the south coast, also has a very stretching target. The local council is being asked to deliver 1,021 new homes per year, almost nine times the 120 it delivered on average over the most recent three years.",
      "Hastings has been tasked with a smaller total: 710. But this is still five times the 142 it has delivered on average in recent years.",
      "Portsmouth approved 74% of residential planning applications in the year to June 2024 and Hastings 75%.",
      "Councils were consulted on the targets last summer, with many expressing concerns they were \"unrealistic\", and the numbers were revised.",
      "Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, leader of Kensington and Chelsea, said it was \"out of touch to let algorithms set targets without understanding local context\".",
      "\"You only have to walk through the streets of our densely built borough to see how unachievable it would be to build 5,107 homes a year here; this borough is only 4.5 miles squared.\"",
      "She said there were two major sites in the borough that would provide 6,000 new homes in total.",
      "Councillor Darren Sanders, cabinet member for housing at Portsmouth City Council, said the target \"does not work\" because \"most of the city is an island\" with a dense population and \"important heritage and natural assets\".",
      "\"Portsmouth has approved more than 4,000 new homes in 2023 and 2024. Any lack of delivery is down to the rising cost of development,\" he said, \"not whether the council approves them.\"",
      "Sevenoaks councillor Julia Thornton said it was a \"top priority\" to protect greenbelt land, but added: \"We will have a duty to do everything possible to meet the government's new housing targets.\"",
      "Sir Keir's housing minister, Matthew Pennycook, has said if councils fail to deliver enough houses the government could intervene.",
      "\"The government can take a local plan off a local authority that is resisting putting one in place, and we are absolutely willing to do it, if we have evidence that [they] are refusing to comply,\" he told the BBC.",
      "The obstacles",
      "The government said it had \"inherited the worst housing crisis in living memory\" and \"all areas must play their part\".",
      "It has set out \"a major planning overhaul\u2026 unblocking barriers to building, and setting out targets for councils to ramp up housebuilding, so new homes are built where they are most needed.\"",

      "There are also concerns about the availability of basic building materials including bricks and timber.",
      "The Construction Leadership Council has warned a shortage of these could hinder the government's ability to get near its target.",
      "Finally, many housing experts doubt private housebuilders are capable of delivering enough new homes each year to reach the targets.",
      "This is because private housebuilders have a commercial interest in not building so many new homes that their average price declines.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority concluded in February 2024  \"private developers produce houses at a rate at which they can be sold without needing to reduce their prices\".",
      "A sharp decline in residential planning permissions in England in the year to June 2024 - hitting a new record low - was due to a collapse in applications from private builders, not a decline in the share of applications being approved by local authorities.",
      "This collapse in applications probably reflected the impact of still-high mortgage interest rates and high house prices relative to average incomes, undermining the ability of people to afford newly built houses.",
      "That's why some argue meeting the government's targets will also require a major increase in Whitehall grants to not-for-profit local housing associations, enabling them to build tens of thousands of new social and affordable homes, mainly to be rented out, in the coming years.",

      "The targets are the government's new \"local housing need\" calculations, released following a public consultation.",
      "Planning statistics are taken from quarterly data and combine applications decided for \"minor\" housing developments (fewer than 10 homes) and \"major\" schemes (10 homes or more).",
      "The planning data for England is at local authority level. Applications decided by special authorities, such as those in charge of national parks, are not included.",
      "We have included the latest data on new housebuilding \"completions\" by local authority area for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but the 1.5 million homes target applies only in England.",

      "The skeletons were dug up from a cemetery by a team of archaeologists at Bournemouth University.",
      "By tracing mitochondrial DNA, which is only passed on by women, Dr Cassidy found that most women in the community were related by blood dating back generations.",
      "By contrast, there was a lot of diversity in the Y chromosomes, which is passed from father to son, indicating that men from lots of different families married into the community.",
      "The DNA analysis also indicates that most of the ancestral line could be traced back to a single woman.",

      "\"But there is a challenge in the UK to create infrastructure... and progress to commercialisation at a rate that is comparable to investment in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Tech advances at break-neck speed",
      "If the UK can scale up, the appetite for investment appears to be there. Prof Wallace is working with two perfume companies that are interested in the process because it is more sustainable than the method they currently use, which involves making the fragrance from chemicals extracted from fossil fuels.",
      "But while the basic technology exists, it is advancing at break-neck speed, meaning the UK's leading role is insecure.",
      "One of Stephen's colleagues, Dr Joanna Sadler, has created microbes that turn used plastic, that would otherwise damage the environment, into vanilla essence and other useful and expensive chemicals.",
      "\"Since I first published the work four or five years ago, the field has absolutely exploded, not just in the UK but across the world,\" she tells me. \"It's an extremely fast-moving field.\"",
      "One member of the University of Edinburgh's hub has created bugs that extract important metals from burnt-out batteries, which would otherwise leak noxious chemicals into landfill. Another is turning waste water from whisky distillation into a plant-based alternative to fish-oil health supplements.",
      "The possibilities are endless, and innovation has accelerated because of the development of cheap and accurate ways of manipulating DNA. It means it is now much easier to harness and adapt the power of nature to create all sorts of things.",
      "However all those possibilities require funding.",
      "A national priority?",
      "The technology was set as a national priority by the previous government in December 2023 with the publication of a policy document called the National Vision for Engineering Biology and an allocation of \u00a32bn over 10 years. The Labour government has indicated that it too regards it as a priority but has made no firm spending commitment.",
      "On the face of it, engineering biology could help Labour achieve two of its five big priorities in government: growth and sustainability. But at present the funding remains uncertain.",
      "The chief scientific advisor Prof Angela McLean, whom the Prime Minister turns to for matters scientific, has been looking into this.",
      "\"We are looking for products like this handbag,\" Prof McLean explained, while stroking a faux leather handbag made by one of the many new start-up engineering biology companies spinning out of university research.",
      "Modern Synthesis based south London made the bag from material grown from a non-genetically engineered microbe.",
      "\"They will be much less polluting, much more sustainable than their current equivalents, as well as generate great jobs, good environment and prosperity,\" she continues.",
      "\"Engineering biology is something the UK is really good at and the world is going to need. It is in its infancy and we need to keep on investing in it as a country.\"",
      "Losing out to Korea and the US",
      "In the 20th Century, the UK led the way in the basic sciences of electronics, computing and the biosciences. But, with some notable exceptions, scientific excellence in these sectors was not translated into truly large world-leading businesses.",
      "In all these cases, there was initial government enthusiasm and funding, but no follow-through. That meant that the science and ideas were bought up by mostly US companies, generating wealth and jobs overseas.",
      "The fear that the UK is losing its way is highlighted in a new House of Lords report, which was out on the 14 January, that says that engineering biology risks going down the same path for exactly the same reasons.",
      "It states that \"other countries are beginning to overtake the UK, and we are at severe risk of losing the prospective benefits of a world-leading engineering biology sector\".",
      "How Biden tarnished his own legacy",
      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "The report also says that there is a \"small but closing window\" to make some small policy tweaks that could make a huge difference, such as recommitting to the target set out in the National Vision for at least \u00a32 billion of funding over the next decade.",
      "Professor Susan Rosser, co-director of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, told the Lords Science and Technology committee, which produced the report, \"we were ahead of the game, but we have lost that leadership because of substantial investments in the US and Korea\".",
      "She said: \"We are losing trained people overseas. People from Edinburgh have moved to Singapore, the States, Germany and Austria.",
      "\"If this is genuinely going to be a key part of our economy, we need the skill set trained, and as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brain drain",
      "Dr Carolina Grandellis, a biofoundry manager at the Earlham Institute research park in Norwich, added that it was hard to replenish the brain drain by attracting scientists from overseas because of a tightening of the visa system by both the previous and current government.",
      "\"The government intends to increase restrictions on legal skilled migration. That will have a cost for our field.\"",
      "According to Baroness Brown of Cambridge, who chairs the Lords committee, the heart of the problem is that there is no clear plan to increase the number of skilled scientists or to have the right policies and regulations in place to enable engineering biology to flourish in the UK.",
      "\"All too often we hear that when companies reach a certain size, they move abroad for better investment and development prospects, taking most of the economic benefit with them,\" she says. \"This requires urgent action\".",
      "Another issue is that the UK biofoundries, like the one at Edinburgh University, are not properly funded, according to Prof Paul Freemont, who is a co-director of a biofoundry at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"The scale of investment in biofoundries internationally is enormous. In Korea, it just announced $100m (\u00a382m) for a K-Biofoundry. In Shenzhen in China, about $750m (\u00a3614m) has gone into a building in which each floor [studies] an organism.",
      "\"Our biofoundry in London had \u00a37m of public investment in infrastructure and we have had no funding for staff. We are constantly scrabbling for cash\".",
      "Not all funding can come from government. But the Lords' report found that enough private investment was not forthcoming either. Unlike in the US, UK investors expect returns in a few years, rather than the tens of years that innovative companies need for their ideas to really start making money.",
      "'Living pollution' that could spread",
      "A further barrier for the field is its regulation by government, especially for applications for producing novel foods, according to Will Milligan CEO of Extracellular, which provides products to firms making lab-grown meat.",
      "\"Singapore, on the other hand, has a very clear framework for the approval process in bringing products to market, and the recommended timelines are about half what they are in the UK.\"",
      "In response to criticisms, the government has set up a body to cut through the red tape, the Regulatory Innovation Office.",
      "But \"streamlining does mean deregulation, in many circumstances\", argues Dr Helen Wallace, director of the campaign group Gene Watch. She worries that the risks of engineering biology are being overlooked by the government in its enthusiasm to reap the claimed benefits.",
      "Many applications of the technology involve creating entirely new organisms which are contained inside large vats in the production process. Even if they were to escape, they are unlikely to survive as they have been engineered to thrive in the very specific, artificial conditions they were designed for.",
      "But Dr Wallace is concerned about some applications that are designed to be released into the environment. \"There is one in the US which is made to survive and reproduce in the soil to boost nitrogen levels, which is very worrying because even very small changes in their DNA could make them more harmful to people, animals and plants.",
      "\"This could create a new kind of living pollution that could spread in rivers, the sea, the air, in rain and you would not be able to reverse any adverse consequences\".",
      "Inadvertent creation of superbugs",
      "Scientists and industrialists agree that without public trust, this shining new industry is going nowhere. And to win trust, the advocates of engineering biology must be open and honest about the risks.",
      "Most worrisome is the inadvertent creation of superbugs that could spread disease or create environmental problems by disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems.",
      "A group of 38 leading scientists recently expressed concern about the creation of \"mirror life\", which would be artificially created organisms whose DNA is the mirror image of their naturally occurring counterparts.",
      "Writing in the journal Science, they said that these mirror organisms could pose serious risks and rip through the immune systems of plants and animals. The scientists have called for a moratorium on their creation until more is known about them and what steps can be taken to minimise risks.",
      "But the problem is that the technology has become so cheap and widely available that such a moratorium would be hard to police. And while the creation of mirror life is a highly specialised skill, bad actors could make simpler changes, increasing the risk of bioterrorism.",
      "Government and manufacturers think that there are considerable environmental and economic benefits to this technology. But if the public won't accept it, there's no point to all this increased investment: it won't be used; no one will buy the products. And there are real risks: scientists and campaigners want the public to be fully informed, in an open and transparent way.",
      "Prof Freemont admits that in their enthusiasm for the good that engineering biology can bring. \"We've taken our eye off the ball a little bit in engaging with the public.",
      "\"The sector needs to ensure that the general consumer and citizen can begin to understand this technology\".",

    "summary": "Pigs, donkeys and even a mini cow named Cuddles found a temporary home after the LA fires.",
    "story": [
      "The trailers arrived all at once, carrying hundreds of horses fleeing the Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles.",
      "Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed.",
      "Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters.",
      "The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.",
      "Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies.",
      "Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened.",
      "A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from the Eaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped.",
      "His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air.",
      "One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured.",
      "\"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\"",
      "Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables.",
      "Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities.",
      "Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides.",
      "\"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\"",
      "But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.",
      "So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy.",
      "Watching owners reunite with their horses was one of the most valuable experiences for volunteers, said London Scott, founder of the local Cali Cowboy Club.",
      "\"It's a really beautiful process to go through,\" Ms Scott said, \"To be able to see that at first hand, and know that you had a small part in someone having a little peace of mind in a tragic moment in time.\"",
      "Those here describe a deep bond to their animals and say the farms that burned down are a place of peace in this bustling metropolitan area.",
      "\"They are my safe place,\" Catherine Armenta, 42, said. \"It's like a bond, a connection that I don't really have with anything else on this planet.\"",
      "Many of those here don't know what happens next, where they might take their animals after the chaos of the ongoing fires burning around the Los Angeles region ends.",
      "\"I haven't been able to even process any of this. There's 40 horses to take care of,\" Ms Bacon said. \"When everything is said and done, I think we're all gonna go get margaritas and just have a good cry.\""

    "story": [
      "Norway is the world leader when it comes to the take up of electric cars, which last year accounted for nine out of 10 new vehicles sold in the country. Can other nations learn from it?",
      "For more than 75 years Oslo-based car dealership Harald A M\u00f8ller has been importing Volkswagens, but early in 2024 it bid farewell to fossil fuel cars.",
      "Now all the passenger vehicles for sale in its showroom are electric (EV).",
      "\"We think it's wrong to advise a customer coming in here today to buy an ICE [internal combustion engine] car, because the future is electric,\" says chief executive Ulf Tore Hekneby, as he walks around the cars on display. \"Long-range, high-charging speed. It's hard to go back.\"",
      "On the streets of Norway's capital, Oslo, battery-powered cars aren't a novelty, they're the norm. Take a look around and you'll soon notice that almost every other car has an \"E\" for \"electric\" on its licence plate.",
      "The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has adopted EVs faster than any other country, and is on the cusp of becoming the first to phase out the sale of new fossil fuel cars.",
      "Last year, the number of electric cars on Norway's roads outnumbered those powered by petrol for the first time. When diesel vehicles are included, electric cars account for almost a third of all on Norwegian roads.",
      "And 88.9% of new cars sold in the country last year were EVs, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed.",
      "In some months sales of fully electric cars were as high as 98%, as new petrol or diesel car purchases almost fizzled out.",
      "By contrast, in the UK electric cars made up only 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Although this was a record high, and up from 16.5% in 2023.",
      "In the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%.",
      "Norway is undoubtedly an EV pioneer, but this electric revolution has been three decades in the making.",
      "\"It started already in the early 1990s,\" says Christina Bu, the secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association, as she took me for a spin around Oslo in an electric minivan.",
      "\"Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes.\"",
      "The support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained.",
      "\"It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,\" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.",
      "Even though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach.",
      "\"We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,\" adds Kroglund. \"I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars.\"",
      "Key to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains.",
      "Rather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars.",
      "A string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed.",
      "By comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030.",
      "Petrol and diesel car sales are still permitted in Norway. But few are choosing to buy them.",
      "For many locals, like St\u00e5le Fyen, who bought his first EV 15 months ago, going electric made economic sense.",
      "\"With all the incentives we have in Norway, with no taxes on EVs, that was quite important to us money wise,\" he says while plugging in his car at a charging station in the capital.",
      "\"In the cold, the range is maybe 20% shorter, but still, with the expansive charging network we have here in Norway, that isn't a big issue really,\" Mr Fyen adds. \"You just have to change your mindset and charge when you can, not when you need to.\"",
      "Another driver, Merete Eggesb\u00f8, says that back in 2014 she was one of the first people in Norway to own a Tesla. \"I really wanted a car that didn't pollute. It gave me a better conscience driving.\"",
      "At Norwegian petrol stations many fuel pumps have been replaced by fast-charging points, and across Norway there are now more than 27,000 public chargers.",
      "This compares with 73,699 in the UK - a country 12 times bigger in terms of population.",
      "That means that, per 100,000 people, Norway has 447 chargers while the UK has just 89, according to a recent report.",
      "Tesla, VW and Toyota, were Norway's top-selling EV brands last year. Meanwhile, Chinese-owned marques - such as MG, BYD, Polestar and XPeng - now make up a combined 10% of the market, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.",
      "Norway, unlike the US and EU, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports.",
      "Ms Bu says there's \"not really any reason why other countries can not copy Norway\". However, she adds that it is \"all about doing it in a way that can work in each country or market\".",
      "Norwegians aren't more environmentally-minded than people elsewhere, she reckons. \"I don't think a green mindset has much to do with it. It has to do with strong policies, and people gradually understanding that driving an electric car is possible.\"",
      "Yet Norway is also a very wealthy nation, which thanks to its huge oil and gas exports, has a sovereign wealth fund worth more than $1.7tn (\u00a31.3tn). This means it can more easily afford big infrastructure-build projects, and absorb the loss of tax revenue from the sale of petrol and diesel cars and their fuel.",
      "The country also has an abundance of renewable hydro electricity, which accounts for 88% of its production capacity.",
      "\"A third of cars are now electric, and it will pass 50% in a few years,\" says Kjell Werner Johansen from the Norwegian Centre for Transport Research. \"I think the government accepts that a few new petrol or hybrid cars will still be on the market, but I don't know anybody who wants to buy a diesel car these days.\"",

      "The European Copernicus climate service, one of the main global data providers, said on Friday that 2024 was the first calendar year to pass the symbolic threshold, as well as the world's hottest on record.",
      "This does not mean the international 1.5C target has been broken, because that refers to a long-term average over decades, but does bring us nearer to doing so as fossil fuel emissions continue to heat the atmosphere.",
      "Last week UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the recent run of temperature records as \"climate breakdown\".",
      "\"We must exit this road to ruin - and we have no time to lose,\" he said in his New Year message, calling for countries to slash emissions of planet-warming gases in 2025.",
      "Global average temperatures for 2024 were around 1.6C above those of the pre-industrial period - the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to Copernicus data.",
      "This breaks the record set in 2023 by just over 0.1C, and means the last 10 years are now the 10 warmest years on record.",
      "The Met Office, Nasa and other climate groups are due to release their own data later on Friday. All are expected to agree that 2024 was the warmest on record, although precise figures vary slightly.",
      "Last year's heat is predominantly due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases, such as carbon dioxide, which are still at record highs.",
      "Natural weather patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o - where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become unusually warm - played a smaller role.",
      "\"By far and away the largest contribution impacting our climate is greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere,\" Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, tells the BBC.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "The 1.5C figure has become a powerful symbol in international climate negotiations ever since it was agreed in Paris in 2015, with many of the most vulnerable countries considering it a matter of survival.",
      "The risks from climate change, such as intense heatwaves, rising sea-levels and loss of wildlife, would be much higher at 2C of warming than at 1.5C, according to a landmark UN report from 2018.",
      "Yet the world has been moving closer and closer to breaching the 1.5C barrier.",
      "\"When exactly we will cross the long-term 1.5C threshold is hard to predict, but we're obviously very close now,\" says Myles Allen of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, and an author of the UN report.",
      "The current trajectory would likely see the world pass 1.5C of long-term warming by the early 2030s. This would be politically significant, but it wouldn't mean game over for climate action.",
      "\"It's not like 1.49C is fine, and 1.51C is the apocalypse - every tenth of a degree matters and climate impacts get progressively worse the more warming we have,\" explains Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.",
      "Even fractions of a degree of global warming can bring more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall.",
      "In 2024, the world saw blistering temperatures in west Africa, prolonged drought in parts of South America, intense rainfall in central Europe and some particularly strong tropical storms hitting north America and south Asia.",
      "These events were just some of those made more intense by climate change over the last year, according to the World Weather Attribution group.",
      "Even this week, as the new figures are released, Los Angeles has been overwhelmed with destructive wildfires fuelled by high winds and a lack of rain.",
      "While there are many contributing factors to this week's events, experts say conditions conducive to fires in California are becoming more likely in a warming world.",
      "It wasn't only air temperatures that set new marks in 2024. The world's sea surface also reached a new daily high, while the total amount of moisture in the atmosphere reached record levels.",
      "That the world is breaking new records is not a surprise: 2024 was always expected to be hot, because of the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern - which ended around April last year - on top of human-caused warming.",
      "But the margin of several records in recent years has been less expected, with some scientists fearing it could represent an acceleration of warming.",
      "\"I think it's safe to say that both 2023 and 2024 temperatures surprised most climate scientists - we didn't think we'd be seeing a year above 1.5C this early,\" says Dr Hausfather.",
      "\"Since 2023 we've had around 0.2C of extra warming that we can't fully explain, on top of what we had expected from climate change and El Ni\u00f1o,\" agrees Helge G\u00f6\u00dfling, a climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.",
      "Various theories have been suggested to explain this 'extra' warmth, such as an apparent reduction in the low-level cloud cover that tends to cool the planet, and prolonged ocean heat following the end of El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "\"The question is whether this acceleration is something persistent linked to human activities that means we will have steeper warming in the future, or whether it is a part of natural variability,\" Dr G\u00f6\u00dfling adds.",
      "\"At the moment it's very hard to say.\"",
      "Despite this uncertainty, scientists stress that humans still have control over the future climate, and sharp reductions in emissions can lessen the consequences of warming.",

    "summary": "Could there be ways to bypass the ban - and could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop the law?",
    "story": [
      "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts a last ditch legal bid from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional.",
      "But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it?",
      "Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he opposed to, even if the courts uphold it?",
      "And whatever happens to TikTok, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future?",
      "Can people still use TikTok even if it's banned?",
      "The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region.",
      "US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force.",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?",
      "Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones.",
      "Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable.",
      "Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target.",
      "Of course, there are ways around such a ban.",
      "There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region.",
      "The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements.",
      "It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app.",
      "So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to.",
      "How else could TikTok be banned?",
      "There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether.",
      "And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country.",
      "It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so.",
      "TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour.",
      "The complexity of the issue means even the experts are unclear about what happens next.",
      "Professor Milton L. Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology - who filed a legal brief in support of TikTok - said a lack of clarity around how far the US could extend its authority to enforce the law makes knowing what technically happens if a ban goes ahead difficult to determine.",
      "But he said what was clear was the impact it would have on users and the internet itself.",
      "\"It would totally legitimise the fragmentation of the internet along national or jurisdictional boundaries,\" he said.",
      "Will Trump still be able to intervene?",
      "Trump has been clear he does not want the law to come into force, asking the Supreme Court to delay its implementation while he seeks a \"political solution.\"",
      "But, should the justices uphold it, Trump does not have the power to overturn the law, which would come into effect the day before he returns to office.",
      "But he could simply tell the Department of Justice not to enforce it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google that they won't be punished for continuing to allow access to TikTok, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "Obviously, the firms might be uncomfortable about breaking the law even if they've been told it's fine - as it would be effectively requiring them to take the president's word for it that they won't face punishment.",
      "What platforms could people turn to instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence.",
      "\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\" she says.",
      "Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms, the controversial policy changes announced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering.",
      "Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.",
      "Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators.",
      "Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December.",
      "Could a new buyer still emerge?",
      "Up until now, ByteDance has been resolute that no sale of its prize asset in the US is on the table.",
      "But could that change if it is actually banned - and when a president who prides himself on \"the art of the deal\" returns to the White House?",
      "Potential buyers continue to line up - with Bloomberg News reporting on Tuesday that the firm was looking at a sale to billionaire Elon Musk, though TikTok has since described this as \"pure fiction\".",
      "Trump's former treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt are among those who have previously expressed an interest in  buying it.",
      "Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok.",
      "There is an even more leftfield - and considerably less serious - proposed owner.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeast has claimed he's now in the running to make a deal after he had billionaires reaching out to him about it.",
      "Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok."

      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",
      "In July 2022, Badenoch, who was not then a minister, said the bill was in \"no fit state to become law\" adding: \"We should not be legislating for hurt feelings.\"",
      "Another Conservative MP, David Davis, said it risked \"the biggest accidental curtailment of free speech in modern history\".",
      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",
      "He did not commit to making changes to the current legislation but said he was \"very open-minded\" on the subject.",

      "He said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, were \"at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry\".",
      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",
      "Responding to Russell's criticism, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and said the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "The law also requires companies to take action against illegal, state-sponsored disinformation. If their services are likely to be accessed by children they should also take steps to protect users against misinformation."

      "Even when an appointment is secured, the rising workload faced by doctors means those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.",
      "But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.",
      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",

      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",

      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

    "story": [
      "Germany's cabinet has decided to authorise the army to shoot down suspicious drones seen near military sites or other critical infrastructure.",
      "A statement from Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said that, \"especially since [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine, we have seen that drones are being used more and more frequently, which poses an increasing challenge for the police and their current technology\".",
      "Russia is suspected of launching a \"shadow war\" against Western countries supporting Ukraine - a charge it denies.",
      "This has included alleged attempts to blow up international airliners, attack infrastructure - or interfere with democratic elections.",
      "\"I can only confirm that Russia planned acts of air terror, not just against Poland but against airlines across the globe,\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Wednesday.",
      "He did not give any details, but his statement appeared to be confirmation of a New York Times report that US President Joe Biden had warned Putin over the alleged plans.",
      "In November, Polish prosecutors said a series of parcel fires targeting courier companies in Europe were dry runs by groups aiming to sabotaging flights to the US and Canada.",
      "Tusk was hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw, a day after Nato announced a new mission to increase the surveillance of ships in the Baltic Sea after critical undersea cables were damaged or severed last year.",

      "Mystery fires were Russian 'test runs' to target cargo flights to US",

      "There have been several instances of unidentified drones flying over military bases recently.",
      "At least 10 such drones had been seen flying above Manching Air Base near the city of Ingolstadt on Sunday evening, German police said.",
      "Last month, there were sightings at Manching and nearby Neuburg an der Donau.",
      "Drones were also spotted at the US air base at Ramstein and at an industrial zone near it in the North Sea.",
      "In her statement, Interior Minister Faeser said \"espionage or sabotage are regularly considered as a possible reason\".",
      "Under the current rules, the German Army can only help police to force drones to move away or to land - but also to fire warning shots to make this happen.",
      "Under the new proposals - which still need parliamentary approval - soldiers may shoot a drone down if they think that is the only way to deal with the danger it poses \"against the lives of people or against a critical facility\".",
      "In November, Polish prosecutors said that a series of parcel fires targeting courier companies in Poland, Germany and the UK were dry runs aimed at sabotaging flights to the US and Canada.",
      "Western security officials believe that they were part of an orchestrated campaign by Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU.",
      "Russia denies being behind acts of sabotage.",
      "But it is suspected to have been behind other attacks on warehouses and railway networks in EU member states this year, including in Sweden and in the Czech Republic."

      "\"The proposals I received today will not give us the possibility to take back Swedish citizenship from gang leaders in criminal networks sitting abroad, directing shootings and bombings and murders on Sweden's streets,\" Strommer told Swedish Radio.",
      "The government points to neighbouring Denmark, where citizenship can already be removed because of an act that is \"seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the state\". The law was recently extended to include some forms of serious gang crime.",
      "Sweden's minority government has also moved to tighten rules on applying for citizenship.",
      "Migration Minister Johan Forssell said that last year police reported 600 cases of people applying who were considered a threat to national security.",

      "The US markets watchdog has filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk alleging he failed to disclose that he had amassed a stake in Twitter, allowing him to buy shares at \"artificially low prices.\"",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit alleges that the multi-billionaire Tesla boss saved $150m (\u00a3123m) in share purchases as a result.",
      "According to SEC rules, investors whose holdings surpass 5% have 10 days to report that they have crossed that threshold. Musk did so 21 days after the purchase, the filing says.",
      "In a social media post, Musk called the SEC a \"totally broken organisation.\"",
      "He also accused the regulator of wasting its time when \"there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished.\"",
      "\"Musk's violation resulted in substantial economic harm to investors,\" the SEC complaint said.",
      "In a statement emailed to BBC News, Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, described the lawsuit as a \"sham\" and \"a campaign of harassment\" against his client.",
      "Twitter's share price rose by more than 27% after Musk made his share purchase public on 4 April 2022, the SEC said.",
      "Musk ended up buying Twitter for $44bn in October 2022 and has since changed the platform's name to X.",
      "The complaint was submitted by the SEC to a federal court in Washington DC on Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit also asked the court to order Musk to give up \"unjust\" profits and pay a fine.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 17:42:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Daniel Chapo's legitimacy has been questioned following protests against his victory.",
    "story": [
      "Mozambique's new President Daniel Chapo has been sworn in at a low-key ceremony in the capital, Maputo, that was marred by an opposition boycott following heavily disputed elections.",
      "In his first presidential address, Chapo, 47, pledged to \"devote all my energies\" to promoting unity and human rights in a nation scarred by post-election violence.",
      "A local civil society group says that more than 300 people have been killed in clashes with security forces since elections in October.",
      "Eight people were killed by police on Wednesday as they protested against the inauguration, Dr Wilker Dias, head of election observer group Plataforma Decide told the BBC.",
      "Most of the victims were supporters of defeated presidential candidate Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane, who had called for a national strike in defiance of Chapo taking office.",
      "In light of Mondlane's appeal, most businesses in Maputo were shut on Wednesday and the streets were largely deserted.",
      "Chapo had won the election with 65% of the vote, extending the 49-year-rule of the Frelimo party.",
      "Mondlane - who contested the election as an independent - came second with 24% of the vote. He rejected the result, saying it was rigged and called for a strike on inauguration day \"against the thieves of the people\".",
      "Addressing about 2,500 guests at the heavily guarded ceremony, Chapo said that \"together, we will restore patriotism and pride in being Mozambican\".",
      "\"Mozambique cannot remain a hostage to corruption, nepotism, and incompetence,\" he added.",
      "Police fired shots to disperse crowds outside Independence Square, where the ceremony was held, as Chapo's motorcade left afterwards.",
      "The crowds were mostly of Mondlane's supporters, but they included some who backed Chapo. Both groups had earlier tried to enter the venue but were barred from doing so.",
      "\"Is this a wedding with private invitations? We want to see the president being sworn in but we have been told we can't,\" Maputo resident Paulu Hamuze told the BBC.",
      "Mondlane's electoral campaign was backed by a small opposition party, which heeded his call for a boycott of the inauguration.",
      "Both of Mozambique's leading opposition parties \u2013 Renamo and MDM \u2013  also boycotted the swearing-in because they also do not recognise Chapo as the rightful winner.",
      "Chapo succeeds Filipe Nyusi, who has stepped down at the end of his two terms.",
      "Even those in Mozambique who wish Chapo well openly question his legitimacy, or whether he will be able to tackle the problems he has identified.",
      "\"Chapo is someone I admire greatly,\" civil society activist Mirna Chitsungo tells the BBC.",
      "\"I worked with him for four years - I am familiar with his willingness to act, his openness to dialogue, and his readiness to follow recommendations from civil society on the ground.\"",
      "\"However, he is assuming an illegitimate power. This stems from a fraudulent electoral process... He is taking power in a context where the people do not accept him.\"",
      "'He will face many enemies'",
      "In addition to winning over a hostile public, Chapo will also have to deliver the economic turnaround and halt to corruption that he promised on the campaign trail.",
      "\"Chapo will face many enemies because it looks like Mozambique is run by cartels, including cartels of books, cartel of medicines, cartel of sugar, cartel of drugs, cartel of kidnappings, mafia groups,\" says analyst and investigative journalist Luis Nhanchote.",
      "\"He needs to have a strong team of experts, willing to join him in this crusade of dismantling the groups meticulously,\" he adds.",
      "\"But first, he has to calm down Mozambicans and do all in his power to restore peace in the country.\"",
      "Daniel Francisco Chapo was born on 6 January 1977 in Inhaminga, a town in Sofala province, the sixth of 10 siblings. This was during Mozambique's civil war, and the armed conflict forced his family to move to another nearby district.",
      "His secondary schooling in the coastal city of Beira was followed by a law degree from Eduardo Mondlane University then a master's degree in development management from the Catholic University of Mozambique.",
      "Now married to Gueta Sulemane Chapo, with whom he has three children, Chapo is also said to be a church-going Christian and fan of basketball and football.",
      "Many current and former colleagues describe Chapo as humble, hard-working and a patient leader.",
      "Ahead of becoming the ruling Frelimo party's presidential candidate, he had been a radio and television host, a legal notary, university lecturer and provincial governor before rising to the post of Frelimo general secretary.",
      "Speaking at his recent birthday celebrations, Chapo himself acknowledged the daunting challenge awaiting him as president.",
      "\"We must recover our country economically... it's easy to destroy, but building is not an easy task.\"",
      "National reconciliation, creating more jobs, reforming electoral law and decentralising power are top of his agenda, he said.",
      "But how successful can he be without much of the country behind him?",
      "At the very least he will mark a change from outgoing President Felipe Nyusi, whom Ms Chitsungo says many Mozambicans will be happy to see the back of.",
      "\"Chapo is a figure of dialogue and consensus, not one to perpetuate Nyusi's violent governance style. He has the potential to negotiate with Mondlane.",
      "\"While Chapo may not fully satisfy all of Mondlane's demands, I believe he could meet at least 50% of them,\" adds Ms Chitsungo.",
      "Mondlane - a part-time pastor who insists he was the true winner of the polls - is reported to be sheltering in one of Maputo's hotels after returning from self-imposed exile.",
      "It is not known what security protection he has there, nor who is paying for it.",
      "He alleges that last week, while touring a market in Maputo, a vendor in his vicinity was shot, echoing the murder of two of his close aides in October.",
      "As the mastermind of nationwide protests against the disputed election result, he has come to be seen by many as a voice for the voiceless. Yet, at present, the president-elect's camp is not engaging him publicly.",
      "Nonetheless, listening to the public's grievances and demands, and sometimes ignoring the commands of his ruling Frelimo party, will be key to Chapo's success, analysts have told the BBC.",
      "Finding some way of engaging constructively with Mondlane would undoubtedly provide a boost, they say.",
      "Winning the public over may also require Chapo to say no to \"fat salaries for the elite and fringe benefits, some of which are 10 times higher than Mozambique's minimum wage\", argues Mr Nhachote.",
      "Plus, if Chapo is to have any chance of bringing an end to the broader political crisis, he will require support from others to make lasting, structural change, argues prominent clergymen Rev Anastacio Chembeze.",
      "\"Perhaps we should remain sceptical of one single person to solve the challenges of Mozambique \u2013 change must start within the system itself.",
      "\"We should strive for a separation of powers within the state apparatus, the international monopolies have huge interests in the country, and we have serious ethical issues within the political elites to address it.\"",
      "Once in office, Chapo should sack the country's Police Chief Bernadino Rafael, analysts have told the BBC. He denies any wrongdoing but is regarded by some as the mastermind behind the brutal response to the post-election protests.",
      "They say they want him replaced with a successor who \"respects human rights\" and follows legal and international standards. Another suggestion analysts have touted is for a new attorney-general to be brought in.",
      "Chapo will be the first president of Mozambique who did not fight in the independence war.",
      "\"He is part of the new generation. Part of his background is completely different from his predecessors - he was born in a country liberated by them,\" says Mr Nhachote.",
      "\"If he wants to make a real mark on history, he has to challenge those past icons. If he can't [manage that], I am sure that he will only run for one term.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 16:41:45 GMT",
    "summary": "The rapper withdraws a case accusing his label of artificially boosting the success of Not Like Us.",
    "story": [
      "Rap superstar Drake is suing Universal Music Group (UMG) for defamation and harassment, over its release of the Kendrick Lamar diss track Not Like Us last year.",
      "The song, which formed part of a furious back and forth between the two stars, accused Drake and his entourage of being \"certified paedophiles\" who should \"be registered and placed on neighbourhood watch\".",
      "In papers filed in New York, Drake's lawyers accused the record label of launching \"a campaign to create a viral hit\" out of a song that made the \"false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\".",
      "Universal has yet to respond to the allegations.",
      "The move comes just 24 hours after Drake withdrew a separate legal action against UMG and Spotify,  in which he accused the two companies of conspiring to artificially boost streams of Not Like Us, at the expense of his own music.",
      "In that case, he argued that Universal had licensed the song \"at drastically reduced rates to Spotify\" and used bots to generate extra plays, generating \"the false impression that the song was more popular than it was in reality\".",
      "In a statement at the time, Universal told the BBC: \"The suggestion that [the company] would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue.\"",
      "It added that \"no amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments... can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\"",
      "Spotify also responded that there was \"no economic incentive for users to stream Not Like Us over any of Drake's tracks\".",
      "The Swedish streaming company later filed an opposition brief to Drake's petition, stating that it \"should be denied\".",

      "The feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar explained",
      "That appeared to draw a line under the legal action - until the story took a dramatic twist on Wednesday morning.",
      "In a lawsuit filed at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Drake accused Universal - which distributes both his music and Lamar's - of prioritising \"corporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists\".",
      "His lawyers noted that the artwork for Not Like Us was based on an aerial photograph of Drake's $100m Toronto mansion, dotted with red markers that are often used to represent the presence of registered sex offenders.",
      "The court documents link that artwork to a shooting at the property shortly after the release of Kendrick's song, calling it \"the 2024 equivalent of 'Pizzagate'\".",
      "The comment referenced a conspiracy theory about a US child sex ring operating out of a Washington pizza restaurant, which led to a gunman opening fire on the eaterie in 2016.",

      "In the lyrics, Lamar alleges that Drake \"likes 'em young\" and accuses him of using other, more credible rappers, to boost his profile.",
      "Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, where he rejected the allegations, saying, \"I never been with no one under age\". He also claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent.",

      "The song is nominated for five prizes, including record and song of the year, at the Grammy Awards on 3 February. A week later, Lamar will headline the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "However, the new lawsuit is not aimed at Lamar himself, according to Drake's lawyers.",
      "\"This lawsuit is not about the artist who created Not Like Us,\" the court documents says.",
      "\"It is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\""

    "story": [
      "Calling people obese is medically \"flawed\" - and the definition should be split into two, a report from global experts says.",
      "The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease.",
      "This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity.",
      "More than a billion people are estimated to be living with obesity worldwide and prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand.",
      "The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.",
      "\"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said.",
      "\"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added.",
      "The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says.",
      "'I feel blessed to get weight-loss jab' - but can the NHS afford it for all?",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight.",
      "\"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell.",
      "\"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me.",

      "\"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\"",
      "Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as having a BMI over 30 - a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight.",
      "How is BMI calculated?",
      "It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.",
      "For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in):",
      "square their height in metres: 1.70 x 1.70 = 2.89divide their weight in kilograms by this amount: 70 \u00f7 2.89 = 24.22display the result to one decimal place: 24.2",

      "It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat.",

      "The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese.",
      "But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs.",
      "Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says.",
      "\"Obesity is a health risk - the difference is it's also an illness for some,\" Prof Rubino said.",
      "What are the two groups?",
      "Clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a disease, there will be signs of it affecting organs in the body - through heart disease, breathlessness, type 2 diabetes or joint pain - and a person's day-to-day activities. Treatment with drugs or surgery is likely.",
      "Pre-clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a risk to health - but not yet causing any illnesses, people should be offered weight-loss advice, counselling and monitoring, to reduce the chances of health problems developing.",
      "Doctors should also pay close attention to a patient's family history to see if they are at risk of particular diseases.",
      "At a time when drugs that reduce body weight by up to 20% are being prescribed on a large scale, the report says redefining obesity \"is all the more relevant\" because it \"improves the accuracy of diagnosis\".",
      "Access to weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro is often restricted to patients with a BMI over 30 and a weight-related health condition.",
      "Children's obesity expert Prof Louise Baur, from the University of Sydney, who contributed to the report, said the new approach would allow adults and children with obesity \"to receive more appropriate care\", while reducing the numbers being over-diagnosed and given unnecessary treatment.",
      "The Royal College of Physicians said the report laid a strong foundation \"for treating obesity with the same medical rigour and compassion as other chronic illnesses\".",

    "story": [
      "The area in Gaza which Israel's military has told people to go to \"for their safety\" has been hit by 97 strikes since May, BBC Verify analysis has revealed.",
      "The findings come as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appear to be nearing a breakthrough. Mediators in Qatar say talks are in their final stages, raising hopes that an agreement could be reached soon.",
      "The \"humanitarian zone\" was first established by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2023 to protect civilians and keep them out of harms way.",
      "On 6 May 2024, the IDF significantly expanded the zone to include the cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah.",
      "The area - much of which is a strip of land along the Mediterranean sea - is densely populated and is estimated to have over a million people living there according to international humanitarian organisations. Many people are living in tents, with limited infrastructure and limited access to aid.",
      "Local media reports indicate more than 550 people have been killed in the 97 strikes mapped by BBC Verify.",
      "In a statement to BBC Verify, the IDF said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\" and accused the group of violating international law while \"exploiting\" civilians as human shields and launching rockets from the area.",
      "Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "The conflict has caused widespread damage to infrastructure across Gaza, with satellite images showing areas flattened by Israeli strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry also says more than 46,600 people have been killed within the enclave since the start of the war.",
      "BBC Verify analysis suggests that attacks within the \"humanitarian zone\" have intensified since May 2024, with at least 22 strikes already recorded so far this month.",
      "We also cannot confirm that all incidents are the result of IDF attacks. Locations of strikes documented by BBC Verify were provided to the IDF but they did not confirm or deny their involvement. Israeli military officials have only publicly acknowledged 28 attacks since 6 May.",
      "Israel historically has not publicly acknowledged every strike it has carried out in Gaza.",
      "Gavin Kelleher, an access manager in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said there were \"near daily\" strikes within the zone, including from Israeli ships and quadcopters, or small drones.",
      "He added that \"heavy fire is recurrent in this area despite its [Israel's] unilateral 'humanitarian' designation.\"",
      "\"The Israeli military appears keen to maintain the illusion of a Humanitarian Zone that remains a certain size, yet that zone can be subject to 'evacuation orders' at any time and be targeted,\" Mr Kelleher said.",
      "One resident who lives within the zone, Khaled Abdel Rahman, told the BBC that residents were being subjected to daily bombardments, frequently resulting in injuries and casualties.",
      "\"We were displaced to Khan Younis because it was designated as a safe zone, but in fact we find nothing here but insecurity,\" Mr Rahman said. \"We have been denied the true sense of security, with fear dominating our lives.\"",
      "As Israel does not allow foreign reporters access to Gaza - apart from highly controlled, escorted trips with its military - international media, including the BBC, is reliant on imagery gathered by Palestinian journalists and Gaza residents.",
      "To track attacks within the IDF's \"humanitarian area\", BBC Verify monitored Palestinian social media channels and official IDF channels on Instagram, Telegram and X. Reports of strikes that included verified imagery from within the boundaries of the zone were then cross-referenced with local media reports to determine a reported death toll.",
      "It's important to note that death tolls cannot be verified based solely on videos and social media reports. BBC Verify analysis excluded reports of fatalities where there wasn't verifiable imagery which confirmed the incident happened within the IDF-defined boundaries of the \"humanitarian area\".",
      "BBC Verify reviewed more than 300 videos and photos posted since May in the \"humanitarian zone\". While it is not always possible to distinguish between fighters and civilians, the footage shows scores of people, including women and children, being pulled from rubble. Some appeared lifeless, while others were severely burned or had significant limb injuries, alongside collapsed buildings, destroyed tents and burnt-out cars.",
      "Seven of the documented strikes are reported to have killed 20 or more people each, with the most deadly on 13 July resulting in more than 90 deaths, according to the Gaza health ministry, first responders and medics.",
      "The IDF later said Hamas military chief, Mohammed Deif, was among the dead. Deif is accused of being one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks.",
      "Nine strikes occurred within 100m of buildings belonging to Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah, and four within 150m of the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.",
      "The IDF told BBC Verify the strikes were conducted \"against terrorists and terror infrastructures including rocket launchers, weapons warehouse and manufacturing sites, operational apartments, underground infrastructure, operational headquarters, and terrorists hideout.\"",
      "They also included links to six of their previously published statements about Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\".",
      "Residents in the zone also live under constant uncertainty. Including evacuation notices, the boundary of the \"humanitarian area\" has changed 20 times - and it has varied in size from around 7 km sq (2.7 sq miles) when it was first introduced to 72 km sq (27.8 sq miles) at its largest.",
      "The IDF said evacuation notices \"do not constitute as a reduction of the humanitarian zone. Once the danger has passed, the residents return\". But it's unclear how residents know it's safe to return, and the IDF has only twice posted to social media to explicitly say so. BBC Verify did not include strikes inside areas where evacuation notices were issued in our tally.",
      "While Israel's military has avoided using the term \"safe zone\", its statements have led civilians to interpret the \"humanitarian zone\" as such. IDF evacuation notices include language that tells civilians - like this one which was issued in mid-December - \"for your own safety, move immediately west to the humanitarian area\".",
      "It has also described the zone as being \"designated for humanitarian aid and shelters as part of the IDF's consistent efforts to protect the uninvolved population.\"",
      "But the UN and international humanitarian organisations operating in Gaza have said there's no such thing as a \"safe zone\" that is unilaterally enforced.",
      "Juliette Touma of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said: \"We have said it so so many times. There is no safe zone in Gaza. No place is safe. No-one is safe. No place is spared.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:00:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Could there be ways to bypass the ban - and could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop the law?",
    "story": [
      "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts a last ditch legal bid from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional.",
      "But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it?",
      "Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he opposed to, even if the courts uphold it?",
      "And whatever happens to TikTok, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future?",
      "Can people still use TikTok even if it's banned?",
      "The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region.",
      "US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force.",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?",
      "Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones.",
      "Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable.",
      "Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target.",
      "Of course, there are ways around such a ban.",
      "There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region.",
      "The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements.",
      "It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app.",
      "So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to.",
      "How else could TikTok be banned?",
      "There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether.",
      "And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country.",
      "It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so.",
      "TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour.",
      "The complexity of the issue means even the experts are unclear about what happens next.",
      "Professor Milton L. Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology - who filed a legal brief in support of TikTok - said a lack of clarity around how far the US could extend its authority to enforce the law makes knowing what technically happens if a ban goes ahead difficult to determine.",
      "But he said what was clear was the impact it would have on users and the internet itself.",
      "\"It would totally legitimise the fragmentation of the internet along national or jurisdictional boundaries,\" he said.",
      "Will Trump still be able to intervene?",
      "Trump has been clear he does not want the law to come into force, asking the Supreme Court to delay its implementation while he seeks a \"political solution.\"",
      "But, should the justices uphold it, Trump does not have the power to overturn the law, which would come into effect the day before he returns to office.",
      "But he could simply tell the Department of Justice not to enforce it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google that they won't be punished for continuing to allow access to TikTok, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "Obviously, the firms might be uncomfortable about breaking the law even if they've been told it's fine - as it would be effectively requiring them to take the president's word for it that they won't face punishment.",
      "What platforms could people turn to instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence.",
      "\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\" she says.",
      "Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms, the controversial policy changes announced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering.",
      "Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.",
      "Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators.",
      "Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December.",
      "Could a new buyer still emerge?",
      "Up until now, ByteDance has been resolute that no sale of its prize asset in the US is on the table.",
      "But could that change if it is actually banned - and when a president who prides himself on \"the art of the deal\" returns to the White House?",
      "Potential buyers continue to line up - with Bloomberg News reporting on Tuesday that the firm was looking at a sale to billionaire Elon Musk, though TikTok has since described this as \"pure fiction\".",
      "Trump's former treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt are among those who have previously expressed an interest in  buying it.",
      "Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok.",
      "There is an even more leftfield - and considerably less serious - proposed owner.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeast has claimed he's now in the running to make a deal after he had billionaires reaching out to him about it.",
      "Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok."

      "Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities.",
      "Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides.",
      "\"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\"",
      "But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.",
      "So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy.",
      "Watching owners reunite with their horses was one of the most valuable experiences for volunteers, said London Scott, founder of the local Cali Cowboy Club.",
      "\"It's a really beautiful process to go through,\" Ms Scott said, \"To be able to see that at first hand, and know that you had a small part in someone having a little peace of mind in a tragic moment in time.\"",
      "Those here describe a deep bond to their animals and say the farms that burned down are a place of peace in this bustling metropolitan area.",
      "\"They are my safe place,\" Catherine Armenta, 42, said. \"It's like a bond, a connection that I don't really have with anything else on this planet.\"",
      "Many of those here don't know what happens next, where they might take their animals after the chaos of the ongoing fires burning around the Los Angeles region ends.",
      "\"I haven't been able to even process any of this. There's 40 horses to take care of,\" Ms Bacon said. \"When everything is said and done, I think we're all gonna go get margaritas and just have a good cry.\""

    "summary": "What we know so far about the possible ceasefire deal agreed between Israel and Hamas.",
    "story": [
      "Sources have told the BBC that Israel and Hamas have agreed a deal which could halt the war in Gaza and see the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "It would be the most dramatic breakthrough in 15 months of war, which began when the armed Palestinian group Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023.",
      "What could be in the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas?",
      "Details of the deal reportedly approved by both sides have not yet been announced.",
      "Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there were still several unresolved clauses, which he hoped would be finalised on Wednesday evening.",
      "A completed deal would see the war in Gaza stop and an exchange of hostages and prisoners.",
      "Hamas seized 251 hostages when it attacked Israel in October 2023. It is still holding 94 captive, although Israel believes that only 60 are still alive.",
      "Israel is expected to release about 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, some jailed for years, in return for the hostages.",

      "Why is there a war in Gaza?",
      "Follow live updates on this story",
      "How could the ceasefire work?",
      "This ceasefire is expected to happen in three stages, once the deal is announced.",
      "And while both sides are now said to have agreed to it, Israel's security cabinet and government will need to approve the deal before it can be implemented.",
      "Here is what we have previously reported could be in the deal.",
      "First stage",
      "Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said that 33 hostages - expected to be women, including female soldiers, children, the elderly and the sick or injured - would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Mr Mencer said that most but not all of the 33 hostages are thought to still be alive.",
      "Three hostages would be released straight away, a Palestinian official told the BBC, with the rest of the exchange taking place over six weeks.",
      "During this stage, Israeli troops would begin pulling out of populated areas in Gaza.",
      "Israel would also allow displaced people now in the south of Gaza to begin to return to the north.",
      "Almost all of Gaza's 2.3 million people have had to leave their homes because of Israeli evacuation orders, Israeli strikes and fighting on the ground.",
      "There would also be a surge in humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, with hundreds of lorries allowed in each day.",
      "The Palestinian official said detailed negotiations for the second and third stages would begin on the 16th day of the ceasefire.",
      "Second stage",
      "What would happen in the second stage is not clear, but there is a broad outline in the drafts leaked to the media.",
      "The remaining male hostages \u2013 soldiers and civilians - would be released in return for more Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Of the 1,000 Palestinian prisoners Israel is thought to have agreed to release overall, about 190 are serving sentences of 15 years or more. An Israeli official told the BBC that those convicted of murder would not be released into the occupied West Bank.",
      "There would also be a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the start of a \"sustainable calm\". That has been defined in previous proposals as \"a permanent cessation of military and hostile operations\".",
      "Third stage",
      "The third and final stage would involve the reconstruction of Gaza - something which could take years \u2013 and the return of any remaining hostages' bodies.",
      "Palestinians and Israelis dare to hope as Gaza deal reportedly close",
      "Three things that could make a Gaza hostage deal more likely",
      "What are the unanswered questions about the deal?",
      "Getting to this point has taken months of painstaking indirect negotiations, not least because Israel and Hamas completely distrust each other.",
      "Hamas wanted a complete end to the war before it would release the hostages, something which was unacceptable to Israel.",
      "The ceasefire will in effect pause the war while its terms are carried out.",
      "However, it is unclear whether it will mean the war is over for good.",
      "One of Israel's key war aims has been to destroy Hamas's military and governing capabilities. Although Israel has severely damaged it, Hamas still has some capacity to operate and regroup.",
      "It is also unclear which hostages are alive or dead or whether Hamas knows the whereabouts of all those who remain unaccounted for.",
      "For its part, Hamas has demanded the release of some prisoners which Israel says it will not free. This is believed to include those who were involved in the 7 October attacks.",
      "It is also not known whether Israel will agree to pull out of the buffer zone by a certain date, or whether its presence there will be open-ended.",
      "Any ceasefire is likely to be fragile.",
      "Ceasefires between Israel and Hamas which have halted previous wars have been shaken by skirmishes and eventually broken down.",
      "The timetable and complexity of this ceasefire means even a small incident could turn into a major threat.",
      "What happened on 7 October 2023 and what has happened in Gaza?",
      "Hundreds of Hamas-led gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on southern Israel, bursting through the border fence and targeting communities, police stations and army bases.",
      "About 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 hostages were taken back to Gaza. Hamas also fired thousands of rockets into Israel.",
      "Israel responded with a massive military campaign, first by air and then a ground invasion. Since then, Israel has attacked targets across Gaza by land, sea and air, while Hamas has attacked Israel with rockets.",
      "Israel's offensive has devastated Gaza and led to severe food shortages, with aid struggling to reach those most in need. More than 46,700 people - the majority of them civilians - have been killed by Israel's attacks, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 03:43:20 GMT",
    "summary": "US President-elect Donald Trump's nominee was grilled for hours about his ability to run the defence department.",
    "story": [
      "Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick for defence secretary in his upcoming presidency, cleared his first hurdle on the way to confirmation: a long - and at times tense - hearing before the US Senate's Armed Services Committee.",
      "For more than four hours on Tuesday, Hegseth faced questions about his ability to run the defence department, including its three million employees and $849bn (\u00a3695bn) budget.",
      "And although he was grilled by Democrats over accusations of sexual assault, infidelity and drinking in the workplace, he appears all but certain to be confirmed to the role after no Republicans came out against him.",
      "This was underscored later on Tuesday when Joni Ernst, one Republican who had been seen as a potential roadblock to his nomination, said she would support him.",
      "Here's a look at the five main takeaways from Hegseth's testimony.",
      "A 'warrior ethos'",
      "From the very start of his testimony, Hegseth, a military veteran, emphasised what he called a \"warrior culture\", vowing to return the focus of the defence department to the strength of America's military.",
      "\"Warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards, and readiness. That's it. That is my job,\" he said in his opening statements.",
      "As the hearing continued, Hegseth was critical of policies he felt harmed the efficiency and \"lethality\" of the military, namely efforts aimed at racial and gender diversity.",
      "\"This is not a time for equity,\" he said, adding that he opposes quotas, which he claims hurt morale.",
      "Women in the military",
      "In what became an expectedly partisan hearing, Democrats repeatedly grilled Hegseth on his past statements suggesting women were not suited to serve in combat roles in the military.",
      "Questions along these lines from Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono and Elizabeth Warren provided some of the most heated moments of the morning.",
      "He spoke over Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, as she tried to point to comments about female service members stretching back years.",

      "Who else is in Trump's top team?",
      "The tricky questions facing Trump's recruits",
      "What Trump can and can't do on day one",
      "\"Mr Hegseth, I'm quoting you in a podcast: 'Women shouldn't be in combat at all',\" Warren said.",
      "Hegseth remained composed, responding by saying his concern was not women in combat, but simply maintaining \"standards\" in the military.",
      "Lack of experience or 'breath of fresh air'?",
      "Hegseth, who at 44 would be the youngest defence secretary in decades, also answered questions about his preparedness to run the defence department, a sprawling agency.",
      "The former Fox News host described himself as a \"change agent\", saying \"it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm.\"",
      "Some Republicans deemed Hegseth's lack of experience a strength.",
      "\"I just want to say for all the talk of experience and not coming from the same cocktail parties that permanent Washington is used to, you are a breath of fresh air,\" Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, said.",
      "A graduate of Princeton and Harvard universities, Hegseth was an infantry platoon leader in Guantanamo Bay and Iraq, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Hegseth, also a former Fox News TV host, has military experience in Afghanistan as well.",
      "Still, Democrats pressed Hegseth on his qualifications for the top military job. Reporting from US media found that Hegseth's tenures at the helm of two non-profit veterans groups ended in financial disarray.",
      "Combat veteran Tammy Duckworth focused on whether Hegseth had ever supervised an audit.",
      "\"Senator, in both of the organisations I ran, we were always completely fiscally responsible,\" Hegseth began, before Duckworth cut in.",
      "\"Yes or no? Did you lead an audit? Do you not know this answer?\" Duckworth said.",
      "What he wasn't asked",
      "Some experts told the BBC they were most struck by how little Hegseth talked about how he'd handle the job's military complexities.",
      "Aside from brief mentions of China and the war in Ukraine and Russia, senators did not ask Hegseth specifically about current conflicts, and other potential military adversaries and strategic rivals.",
      "Those fundamental issues were mostly \"crowded out\" by the questions about  Hegseth's character and competence, said Mara Karlin, former assistant defence secretary for strategy, plans, and capabilities.",
      "\"What's astonishing about the hearing is just how little focus there has been on the bread and butter of what the secretary of defence has to do, which is protect the nation, and ensure you have a military capable of winning conflicts,\" Karlin said.",
      "Senate Armed Services Committee member Tammy Duckworth was also unimpressed with what Hegseth had to say about military strategy.",
      "\"He couldn't answer some of the most basic questions I asked of him,\" the Democratic Senator from Illinois told the BBC.",
      "Duckworth said that Hegseth could not name a single country that is in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - \"basic questions that any international affairs college student would be able to answer\".",
      "\"All he did today was reaffirm to me that he's not qualified for this job,\" she said.",
      "Sexual assault or smear campaign?",
      "A 2017 accusation of sexual assault in Monterey, California, which surfaced soon after Trump tapped him for the Pentagon role, came up repeatedly.",
      "According to a police report, an unnamed woman said Hegseth took her phone and blocked the door when she tried to leave his hotel room before sexually assaulting her.",
      "Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer acknowledged Hegseth had paid an undisclosed amount to stay quiet about the incident.",
      "On Tuesday, Hegseth mainly went on the offensive, decrying a \"coordinated smear campaign\" orchestrated by the left-wing media. \"They want to destroy me.\"",
      "But at other times in the hearing, Hegseth responded to questions about his conduct with passionate references to his Christian faith.",
      "\"I am not a perfect person, but redemption is real,\" he said.",
      "Senator Tim Kaine, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, found these statements to be unsatisfactorily contradictory.",
      "Referencing the allegations of sexual assault, views on women and drinking, Kaine repeatedly asked Hegseth during the confirmation hearing how Hegseth can be both a changed man and the allegations against him be meritless.",
      "\"If all those allegations were false, then what do you mean you changed and reformed,\" Kaine told the BBC.",

      "Introduction",
      "The first time it hit me that I had reached \"a certain age\" was while strolling through the streets of downtown New York with my daughters. They are, if I may be so bold, stunning girls. Rowan is a strawberry blonde with curves to die for; Grier is six feet tall, all legs, and towers over me. They're also funny, fiercely intelligent, thoughtful, and kind, though I guess those traits are less obvious to the casual observer.",
      "On this particular day, we were walking side by side, me in the middle, and it was impossible not to notice the admiring looks from various passersby. Over the years I've become used to being recognized on the street, but this time was different: the looks weren't cast in my direction, but at the two beauties by my side. I had every single feeling, all at once. What are you doing ogling my babies I will cut you but also aren't they gorgeous but also, wait, no one's gazing at me? When did that happen? Am I over? Protectiveness, pride, melancholy\u2014it all smacked me upside the head in one quintessential New York minute.",
      "There was also the time I was doing a photo shoot, and after a couple shots I took a peek at the monitor. \"I think there's some dust on the camera lens,\" I said to the photographer, pointing to a weird line on my cheek. His response was something to the effect of a pitying \"Awww, you're cute.\" There was no dust. That \"something\" was a wrinkle.",
      "I didn't have my first child until I was thirty-seven. I went through a hard time after I had Rowan, suffering from postpartum depression, which I wrote about in my first book, Down Came the Rain. But with the help of good medical professionals and the right medication, I felt like myself again, more or less, by her first birthday. I had Grier when I was forty, and the ensuing decade felt, in a word, playful. That was a brand-new feeling for me. I remember thinking in my forties, This isn't old at all! This is fun! Keep in mind, I'd been treated like an adult (and was expected to behave like one) since I was a kid. At forty, it was as though my biological age finally aligned with the age I'd felt for decades. I felt mature yet still playful. I was firing on all cylinders, and at the risk of sounding like Maria von Trapp, the world seemed full of possibilities. I felt like I was being primed for a moment when I could finally pat myself on the back and say \"You've earned it!\" if I chose to take a break. Plus, I'd arrived at a place of self-acceptance. I actually liked my body and no longer compared it to the runway models. (I never did runway and believed those girls were \"skinny,\" whereas I was considered \"athletic\"\u2014in my modeling days, a euphemism for \"not skinny.\") At forty, relieving myself of being compared to others felt like freedom. Mine was a body to be proud of. This body gave me babies! This body could dance! I had curves and was okay with that! It wasn't exactly \"I am woman, hear me roar,\" but I certainly felt like, \"I am woman, hear me more.\"",
      "And yet, as my forties progressed into my fifties, I began to notice that external perceptions didn't seem to match up with my internal sense of self. My industry no longer received me with the same enthusiasm I had come to expect. The vibe from casting agents and producers, but also my fans, was more: you need to stop time ... and maybe even reverse it. Case in point: at a routine dermatological appointment (to get a mole checked out), the doctor, unsolicited, waved his hand around my face and said, \"We could fix all that ...\"",
      "\"All what?\" I asked.",
      "\"You know, all the\"\u2014cue more hand waving\u2014\"you know.\"",
      "What the hell? Who asked for your opinion? I thought as I heard myself say, \"Thank you, but not yet.\"",
      "Maybe it took seeing myself through the eyes of other people to fully understand that, in fact, I was entering a new era of life. I mean, I was aware that some things were changing. I get tired now in a way I never did before. I literally can't read the fine print, and I hate it. I used to get mad at my mom for always misplacing her reading glasses, and now it's me saying \"Grier, honey, have you seen my readers?\" I like doing needlepoint and puzzles, which admittedly feels a bit geriatric. Am I in my mahjongg era?? I need 2.5s for these granny activities!",
      "And yes, sometimes I put on a pair of pants that once fit, and think, God, this used to be so much easier. Or I watch my kids, who can sleep until noon without stirring at the garbage trucks or sirens outside, and think, Ah, youth. There was a time when I could go to bed without taking a pill or being up for hours in the middle of the night, what was that like? And though these shockingly beautiful young women spend hours in front of the very mirrors I try to avoid, they still don't realize how fresh and perky and unaffected by gravity their bodies are\u2014just like we didn't at their age. (I mean, the butt and the boobs! How did I not appreciate that when I had it?) They complain that they hate their legs, whereas my knees are now practically lower than my calves. How is that even a thing? We are always chasing, never appreciating, and what runs through my mind is, Ugh, where is the justice?? Why are we forever criticizing ourselves and our bodies while seeking ridiculous perfection? Why do we never see how unique and special we are? And why, when we finally take the pressure off or count our blessings or just enjoy who we are, is it practically too late?",
      "But while I don't feel as invincible as I did in my youth, I also don't feel fifty-nine. When I was a kid, fifty-nine seemed so OLD, but it sure doesn't feel old to me now! When I say my age out loud, I know it may sound old to some people, but I truly don't feel, in any way, aged. Aging is a journey full of contradictions, especially in America. It's humbling and surprising and empowering and daunting and liberating. In plenty of cultures, older people are revered. In Korea, the sixtieth and seventieth birthdays are considered major life events, marked by parties and feasts. In Native American communities, elders are often referred to as \"wisdom-keepers\"\u2014they're considered community leaders. In India, elders have the final word in family disputes. In the Henchy-Shields household, on the other hand, this elder is constantly told, \"Mom, you just don't get it!\"",
      "In fact, a March 2023 cover story of the American Psychological Association's Monitor on Psychology described ageism in America as \"one of the last socially acceptable prejudices.\" Brands trip over themselves to capture the coveted eighteen-to-thirty-four demographic, even though surveys have found it's women over forty who have the most purchasing power: we have accumulated wealth, and we're making 85 percent of the household-buying decisions. The numbers for women over fifty are even more staggering: We control a net worth of $19 trillion, and spend 2.5 times that of the average person. Women in their forties and fifties are treated like we're invisible, even though we're one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country. (One in four Americans is a woman over forty.) We are ignored by brands, and when we are targeted, it's for wrinkle cream or menopause supplements. Talk about shortsighted.",
      "This notion of invisibility is so widespread, so pervasive, that it has become the namesake of a social phenomenon, aptly dubbed \"invisible woman syndrome.\" The gist? When we are no longer deemed sexy or able to contribute to society by birthing and raising young children, our value diminishes. We are overlooked, ignored, or worse, not seen at all.",
      "And the older we get, the more extreme it gets. An analysis of nearly eleven thousand ads featuring over twenty thousand people in 2021 and 2022 found that those featuring women over sixty years old amounted to a whopping 0.93 percent of all advertisements. You read that right: less than one percent of all advertisements feature women over sixty, even though the 2020 census found that one in six people in America is over sixty-five.",
      "According to a survey of women over forty by the advertising agency Fancy (which is specifically focused on marketing to a female audience), most women over forty feel that brands \"underestimate their spending power and intelligence while overestimating their preoccupation with appearance.\" We are, it turns out, more than just a demographic obsessed with looking younger. We embody vitality. We are smart and vibrant and powerful and ambitious. We are experienced, confident, capable, and complicated. We are running s**t.",
      "The truth is, I still can't quite get over that I'm using words like \"aging\" and \"elder\" in the same breath as I talk about myself and my friends. I'm not even sixty! I may not be playing the ing\u00e9nue or the girl next door or even the first love, but I'm not exactly the grandmother in Titanic.",
      "And yet, no one knows what to do with me. After all, Brooke Shields is not allowed to get old. The sixteen-year-old Calvin Klein model? Time magazine's face of the '80s? It's sacrilegious! I remember seeing a picture of what Marilyn Monroe would look like if she were still alive today, and it was truly impossible to wrap my head around. But she died looking like Marilyn Monroe. For me, as my body and face change in all the ways they should (don't get me started on my thinning, graying eyebrows), there is this sense of How dare you? That was never the plan, young lady! And, to be totally honest, there have been times when it's made me feel like a disappointment. Maybe you've felt this way, too\u2014maybe you were an athlete in your youth, singled out for your form and speed, and now you can still swim or run or play tennis or whatever, but not at the same level. You're still strong, but you had the audacity to grow older, to change, to slow down a bit, to not die young or stop aging entirely. You survived, and it should be celebrated, and yet there's a sense that you're not as valuable or exceptional as you once were, and therefore you're letting people down. And these reactions can cause us to feel disappointed in ourselves, too. I look back sometimes and feel like I've done something wrong because I no longer have the body or the face that I used to have. And yet, if I did anything drastic to hold on to my looks from my youth or to stop aging, I'd be judged or chastised for that, too.",
      "Generally speaking, at fifty-nine, I feel more confident than I ever have. I'm more comfortable in my skin and have stopped comparing myself to this ideal or worrying about that expectation. But I'll admit that even as I'm experiencing this newfound sense of satisfaction, I have to remind myself, sometimes daily, that I am good enough. The old negative tapes are lying in wait in the Walkman (remember those!?), ready for me to press play at any moment. But I also realize that if I don't wear makeup or the \"right-sized jeans and someone has a problem with it, that's on them. And yes, I continue to exercise and take care of my skin, but I think of it now as a privilege, because it makes me feel better. Do I sometimes wish that all my bits had remained higher and perkier? Or that I had the same skin that appeared on the cover of Life magazine in 1983? Of course I do! Who doesn't miss the gifts of youth? But this is a body\u2014and soul\u2014that has carried me through a lot, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I think I deserve some credit for this life well lived. We do all this work and get through hard times and suddenly you have a line on your face, and that one little wrinkle carries more weight than decades of accomplishments.",
      "I'll tell you, it took me a long time to have the guts to say that I deserved a bit more respect. Something began to shift in me around age forty. I started to own myself and my narrative in a new way. I'm not sure what it was that finally clicked, though becoming a mother probably had something to do with it. What I do know is that gaining that deeper sense of identity allowed me to speak up when others tried to diminish me. It's allowed me to look within and identify patterns and break cycles. It's allowed me to take on new risks and challenges. I know who I am and what I have to offer, and I've stopped hoping or trying to be different, or something that I'm not.",
      "Of course, as proud as I am of how far I've come ... there is still so much that I want to do. I want to pile into a camper with my daughters and my husband and take a cross-country road trip (although we'd probably end up killing each other, and the romance of the Porta Potti would surely wear off quickly). I want to learn to play an instrument. I want to get back to being fluent in French (it was my college major, after all). I want to travel to places I haven't been. The list goes on.",
      "All of this is doable, because there's a lot of freedom that comes with age. It's more fun to take a dance class when you can truly let yourself dance like no one is watching. It's more fun to go out with friends when you aren't worrying if you said the wrong thing or if people are talking about you behind your back. It's more fun to go to a restaurant alone when you realize that no one is wondering why you don't have a companion ... that no one is looking at you at all, because they're all dealing with their own s**t. And while, yes, my body is a little creakier than it once was, and it's not as easy to lose weight, the truth is I can still do almost everything I used to do. And the things I can't, well, I don't really want to. I don't want to surf ... I don't want to ski, unless it's somewhere sunny and the trail is long and relatively flat\u2014I just don't feel like exposing myself to freezing temperatures, fighting scary moguls, and navigating with the gear. But I don't feel limited. I'm happy that, at least for me, the moment for more intense, competitive activities has passed, and the moment for new emotional beginnings has arrived. I don't have to prove myself anymore. This is it. This is me! And if there is something I want to change, then I can make the decision to do so.",
      "What I've come to realize\u2014not only from my own lived experience but also from conversations with other women my age\u2014is that these \"later\" years are all about coming into your own and pivoting in the directions you've always wanted to go. You can finally live the life you intended to, because you no longer have to act in accordance with external timelines, something that is part and parcel of being a woman. I don't have to get married by this date or have kids by this age or get a certain job before that milestone. My time is my own.",
      "And yet\u2014 this newfound gift has come as a bit of a surprise. After all, the narrative we've been served for years is that it's all downhill for women after a certain age. As I hit my midfifties, I grew increasingly curious about the disconnect between how this age feels and how it's portrayed in our culture and society. I talked to other women my age who felt the same tension I did\u2014 both personally empowered and systemically dismissed. And this idea of being collectively ignored ... it irked me. I started connecting even more with women over forty, online and on social media, because I wanted to dig into what makes aging hard and what makes it great. What began as an online community to discuss health, aging, sexuality, relationships, and just plain living\u2014to dish about all those things you can't say to anyone except your closest girlfriends\u2014evolved into a hair-care brand, Commence, and a new business. So here I am, a first-time CEO in my fifties, inspired to start a business\u2014and write a book!\u2014all because of society's most uninspiring take on women my age.",
      "My first two memoirs, Down Came the Rain and There Was a Little Girl, were at their core about overcoming obstacles: first, postpartum depression, and second, losing my mom. But there is nothing to \"overcome\" about aging. That's the whole point! This time of our lives is something to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive. So if those books were about how I persevered through tough moments, this one is about how I took ownership and agency of a moment I'd been told would be tough, but really is rich and complex. But come on, life is complex. This book is about embracing an era that has been billed as an obstacle when, in reality, it's a stimulus. Yes, it has new and difficult challenges, but it doesn't have to be viewed as torture or a time to throw in the towel. I'm not trying to stave off this period, or deny it, or pretend I'm not in it. I'm taking the whole mess of it and reminding myself, and hopefully other women, that we have the elements we need to thrive. The story we've been told is, in a word, bulls**t. We are the narrators of our next chapters.",
      "For too long, women have talked about aging only in whispers and behind closed doors. Maybe it's because we've been embarrassed or ashamed. Maybe it's because we don't think anyone would want to hear what we have to say. These are understandable responses to our treatment by society, but they only serve to keep us isolated and disempowered. Recently, I had the pleasure of attending an intimate \"couch conversation\" with Gloria Steinem where she was talking about the challenges of being a woman today. The younger women in the room were eagerly asking her, \"But how can we fix it? How can we be a force for change?\" And she reminded us that \"every important movement started in a room like this\u2014in a basement, or a living room.\" When we step out from behind those closed doors and use our voices to talk about the misunderstandings, the underestimations, we're already starting to change them. Maybe even fix them.",
      "As far as I can tell, these decades in our lives are a time to be celebrated. Sure, there will be some hot flashes (been there!), but we can wear layers. (Or take hormones, which I have done, but more on that later.) I can tell you that the discomfort of those moments is far outweighed by the delight that comes from making intentional friendships, pursuing new interests, discovering our peak confidence, and giving ourselves permission to make changes to our lives.",
      "In 2023, my dear friend Ali Wentworth produced a documentary, Pretty Baby, about my life. Watching it, and seeing just how much I've been through, I couldn't help but feel proud. I'm not saying everyone should make a documentary about their lives, but I hope you can look back at how far you've come, how much life you've lived in order to get to this moment, and give yourself credit for the feat that it is. And then I hope it gives you the jump start you need to figure out how to enjoy this new stage of your life. Because the time is now! If there is something you want to change, now's the time to change it. If there's something you want to stop, now's the time to stop it. If there's something you want to do, now's the time to do it.",
      "Being relegated to the sidelines, as misguided as it is, also offers us more room to fully be ourselves. There's less pressure. We can push boundaries when we're moving through the world without the watchful eyes of, well, everyone. In Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis, author Ada Calhoun reconsiders all the so-called negatives of getting older. \"Could we see ... our newfound midlife invisibility as a source of power?\" she writes. \"There are great advantages to being underestimated. Two of the best reporters I know are women in their fifties. They look so friendly and nonthreatening, if you notice them at all. They can lurk in any room without usually wary people remembering to keep their guard up. Then they write devastating whistle-blowing articles. The world ignores middle-aged women at its peril.\"",
      "At fifty-nine, I'm the one making the calls in my life\u2014not my mother or the media or Hollywood or my family\u2014which is something I've never felt before. And this should be true for all of us. It doesn't matter what you've done, or what you think you've done (good or bad), or even what you always wanted to do. This is a new time. The same rules don't apply. Is that disorienting? Maybe, but I like to give it a different spin: We can make our own rules.",

    "summary": "Now nearly 60, the model and actress was recently elected president of Actors' Equity, and launched Commence, her beauty brand for women over 40. She's also written her fourth book, \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old,\"",
    "story": [
      "Last Sunday, Demi Moore accepted her first major acting award at the Golden Globes. Watching from home was Brooke Shields \"My kids'll be like, 'Oh, it's Golden Globe night. Get the bottle of wine for Mom! Get the tequila!'\" Shields laughed. \"It's so interesting, these award shows, right? They can be torturous if you sit there and you go like, Why am I not valid enough to get that, do that, whatever?\"",
      "I asked, \"You've felt that?\"",
      "\"I've felt it my entire life.\"",
      "It can be surprising to hear that a veteran actress like Shields yearns for acceptance. Turns out she's totally human. \"I was listening to Demi, 'We've weren't the ones that ever got awards.' Like, no. I got People's Choice Awards! The people loved me.\"",
      "\"So, you get the People's Choice Award, but you wanted the Emmy, the Oscar?\"",
      "\"You just wanted, like, to be part of the group, the cool kids,\" said Shields. \"That's where the little insecure girl comes out.\"",
      "At this point in her career of six decades, the comedienne has earned the right to laugh at herself.",
      "Currently 59, Shields said she feels 38. \"I definitely feel a youthfulness that I didn't feel in my younger years,\" she said.",
      "She started modeling while wearing diapers. Later, she turned heads wearing Calvin Klein jeans. Shields was expected to sell products and say her lines, all while looking gorgeous. She delivered.",
      "But as she approaches 60, she's found a cultural script she's powerfully rejecting.",
      "\"By the time you get to 50, they've just completely written you off,\" she said. \"You are out to pasture. Society says, 'Oh, if you're not the hot twenty-something at the bar, you're an old lady.' There's this whole demo in the middle that gets just overlooked.\"",
      "It's those overlooked women for whom Shields has written her fourth book: \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old\" (to be published Tuesday by Flatiron). \"When you are someone that has been noted for looking a certain way, by virtue of just growing older, you become a disappointment, in a way,\" she said. \"I've watched people get sort of personally affronted that I dare to be 60!\"",
      "\"And what do you say to them?\"",
      "\"I just sort of feel bad for them,\" Shields said. \"And I'm a part of the problem, because I was that symbol, you know, maybe unwittingly. But I didn't set out to do that.\"",
      "Nearly 44 years after being named the face of a decade, Shields hopes to be a voice for her generation \u2013 empowering women by sharing her personal and at times vulnerable experiences.",
      "In her book, she reveals that a doctor performed a surgery on her that she did not consent to. \"I was asked by my gynecologist if I experienced discomfort, and I said yes.\"",
      "In the late 2000s, Shields went to a surgeon to help reduce some labia discomfort. But after the operation, she says she found out he performed an extra procedure: an unwanted vaginal rejuvenation. \"He literally looked at me and said, like, 'I tightened you up a bit,'\" Shields said. \"And I was like, 'What?' And he just sort of was, like, boasting that he 'threw in a little bonus' for me. And I was in such shock that I just, I became numb. I didn't even know what to do.\"",
      "\"What did you say?\"",
      "\"I didn't say it, I didn't say a thing. because it sounded like he wanted me to thank him,\" Shields replied. \"I didn't say anything then, and this is the first time I've said anything.\"",
      "That so-called bonus surgery has had lasting side effects. The actress and model says sex can be painful.",
      "\"This was, you know, a long time ago. We didn't know what we could fight or complain. I finally had a life and kids, and it was like, 'Dear God, I don't want that kind of attention,'\" she said.",
      "So, why is she speaking out now? \"Because I have daughters. And there's no shame around it. And the more we have those conversations with them, conversations that I never had, the more progress I think we will have as women.\"",
      "Shields is looking to make progress in other ways, too. In May, she was elected president of Actors' Equity Association, the union representing 51,000 actors and stage managers around the country. As a five-time Broadway star, she felt a responsibility to give back to a community that's embraced her.",
      "She's already taken her fight to Washington for more funding and to change tax policy. \u00a0\"It's been a learning curve,\" she said. \"It's trial by fire. I'd never gone on the Hill and met with Congressmen and Senators. But you know, producers need to take care of the people that bleed for them on a daily basis.\"",
      "Besides being a union boss, Shields is now a CEO. She'd founded the beauty brand Commence, after hearing concerns from aging women about their hair. \"They have felt overlooked, and that's just the truth,\" she said. \"They're not being marketed to.\"",
      "Asked what the hardest part of being a CEO is, Shields replied, \"Money raising. Keeping the money flowing, because you have to put it right back into the company. And you know, nobody's getting salaries yet. Least I'm not!\" she laughed.",
      "Don't ask Brooke Shields if she's ready to slow down. Age has brought wisdom, and she's just getting started.",
      "\"I'm, you know, going to be 60 years old,\" she said. \"I'm still here. I feel like I'm at the beginning of a new, really exciting stage. The more confident you get \u2013 isn't it interesting \u2013 the more opportunity you get. And yet, you couldn't have arrived at said confidence without going through all the time to get here.\"",

    "title": "Wendell Pierce: An actor's journey",
    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:40:16 -0500",
    "summary": "With standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Death of a Salesman,\" and the CBS drama \"Elsbeth,\" the acclaimed actor talks about his childhood in New Orleans, training at New York's Juilliard School, and tackling the character of Willy Loman.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a few years since Wendell Pierce attended a drama class at the Juilliard School in Manhattan. Forty years, to be exact. \"I remember it well. High windows and gray floors!\" he laughed.",
      "He's said that nothing in his career gave him as much anxiety as training at Juilliard: \"Yes, the anxiety of, you know, am I doing the right thing? I'm going into an unknown world. Will I have what it takes to be just a working actor? And so, I was reminded looking in that class, it was very touching to see these young people at a point in the journey that I recall with fondness \u2013 and with a lot of anxiety, too! But I knew I was exactly where I wanted to be.\"",
      "And it's where he belongs. At 61, Pierce is among the most prolific and respected actors of his generation, with standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Treme,\" \"Suits,\" \"Selma,\" and now, the quirky CBS drama, \"Elsbeth.\" Later this year, he'll play editor-in-chief Perry White in the newest Superman movie. He'll also take on Othello at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C.",
      "No matter the part, Pierce brings his own humanity to it. He said, \"In every role, there's a little part of Wendell in it. At the end of the run, I turn the lights down low in the dressing room and I just see the silhouette in the mirror. And I have a good cry and say goodbye. Right? I say, 'Man, you taught me so much about myself. I've learned so much from you. I hope I see you again. And I know there'll be times where I will see you again.'\"",
      "That sense of self-discovery began in his hometown of New Orleans, and the historical Black neighborhood of Pontchatrain Park. \"It was like a Black Mayberry,\" he said. \"The first Black mayor came out of there, the first Black DA. Lawyers, doctors, postal workers, maintenance men. That was the community I grew up in. It was absolutely wonderful. And it was totally destroyed. We were destroyed by Katrina. We were part of the deepest flooding. And we brought it back, and now we're on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",
      "His mother, Althea, was a beloved schoolteacher. \"She taught everybody in the neighborhood. And I just remember how, everywhere I went, I knew that I had to live up to being her son,\" Pierce said.",
      "His father, Amos Pierce, Jr., was a World War II veteran. \"He was Army unit attached to the 3rd Marines in the invasion of Saipan. And after that, his unit received medals of commendation. And because he was there with the Black unit, the officer didn't believe him when he told him. He said, 'Listen, I think we received medals.' And it was a woman who said, 'Yeah, right. You? You didn't receive anything.'\"",
      "It would take 65 years for the injustice to be corrected. \"We gave him his medals on Veteran's Day 2010,\" Pierce said. \"I tell that story to say that he was a man who loved this country even when the country didn't love him back. And even after receiving the medals, there was a great pride. He didn't let the anger destroy him. And that was a great lesson.\"",
      "Pierce sees his own life as a series of lessons \u2013 and acting is part of that journey. He said, \"Every audition for me is an opening and closing night, where you get to perform: This is what I would do with this material. You do whatever you like from this point on. And then you leave the room.\"",
      "And he says his best work \u2013 be it as Detective Bunk Moreland on \"The Wire,\" or in Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X,\" comes from the writing. He said, \"The really good material is the thing that will define it, you know, and make it classic. Something that speaks to people across time and place no matter where you are, that's gonna speak to people years from now.\"",
      "A career highlight was in 2022, when Pierce became the first Black actor to play Willy Loman on Broadway, in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\"",
      "Why does he think it took so long? \"The ignorance of biases and bigotry, and when people just don't have the ability to see others' humanity,\" Pierce said. \"And it's something that people are very conscious of at times, and then sometimes they're not very conscious of it.\"",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "And it's Pierce's own compassion that draws people towards him, like Carrie Preston, his co-star on \"Elsbeth.\" She said, \"This kind of connection isn't always guaranteed. We've got it here. I'm grateful for it.\"",
      "And it's what his fellow Juilliard classmate Bradley Whitford recalled when he surprised Pierce with a message during our interview: \"Wendell, I miss you. I love you. I am so proud of you, not only for the great actor that you are and the dear friend, but what an amazing citizen you are. I love you!\"",
      "\"That's very special,\" said Pierce. \"Brad and I, we're part of a very special group here at Juilliard, our class. You know, when you go through the fire together, you're connected forever.\"",
      "Pierce has said he wants to make his mark. I asked, \"Do you think that you have? And what is that mark? What do you want to leave for people?\"",
      "\"I was afraid that I may not have the opportunity to leave my mark, that my best days were behind me,\" he replied. \"I had that fear, and I tapped into that fear when I did 'Death of a Salesman.' And while I still have the fear, now I have courage.",
      "\"I hope I can have an impact on someone else that way, the way they have an impact on me.\"",

      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \"call and response\" of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music's most enduring hits, which also included \"You Don't Know Like I Know,\" \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" and \"I Thank You.\"",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music's most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \"Play it, Steve\" midway through \"Soul Man.\"",
      "Like many '60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \"Soul Man\" hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \"Saturday Night Live\" stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \"Soul Men\" depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning that, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\"Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?\" Moore said then. \"If you're making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don't give me cornbread and tell me it's biscuits.\"",
      "Moore wrote the song \"Dole Man,\" modeled on \"Soul Man,\" for Republican Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump's inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign used the song \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\"",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s but didn't meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label's Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band's troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "He married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction which he credited with saving his life.",
      "\"I did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\"That's funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I'm laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\"",
      "Moore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and performed for presidents, including Obama.",
      "Moore is survived by his wife, Joyce, daughter, Michell, and two grandchildren.",

    "story": [
      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention,\u00a0experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Trump urges court to pause",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been changed to clarify that TikTok could shut down on Jan. 19 if the Supreme Court rules against its request for a temporary injunction that would overturn or delay a law that could lead to a U.S. ban.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:14:24 -0500",
    "summary": "It will be up to the returning Trump administration to decide whether to finalize the rule.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is moving to cut out addictive nicotine from cigarettes, according to a long-awaited proposed regulation released Wednesday.",
      "The rule aims to force the nearly 12% of Americans still using combustible tobacco products to switch to less dangerous alternatives, like vaping electronic cigarettes or using nicotine lozenges, or quit altogether while ending rates of youth starting to smoke traditional cigarettes.",
      "\"The proposed product standard would limit the addictiveness of the most toxic and widely used tobacco products, which would have significant public health benefits for all age groups,\" the agency wrote in the\u00a0proposed rule.",
      "Though vaping rates have climbed in recent years, fewer adults vape than smoke traditional cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 6% of adults use e-cigarettes.",
      "It will now be up to the returning Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize this measure, which was first floated during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At the time, the head of the FDA called it \"one of the most important actions I could take to advance public health.\"",
      "\"If there is a goal to Make America Healthy Again, I can't imagine anything more important to get done than this,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "A related effort to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes stalled out last year under the Biden administration, amid political blowback over the measure.",
      "The FDA says the proposed rule will apply to traditional cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars and pipe tobacco. Cigarette manufacturers will have two years to come into compliance with the rule, after it is finalized.",
      "Agency officials stressed that they were not seeking to ban cigarettes or other tobacco products outright. They acknowledged the rule may result in some illegal imports of high nicotine cigarettes, but not enough to outweigh those switching or quitting. Half of smokers are expected to switch within the first years, they estimate.",
      "\"Even if some amount of illicit trade develops, we will still have a significantly greater magnitude of benefits that would outweigh any impacts of potential illicit markets,\" said Brian King, head of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "Tobacco companies will need to cut nicotine levels to 0.7 milligrams per gram of tobacco, a fraction of the 17.2 milligrams per gram that most cigarette brands have on average.",
      "Why didn't the FDA ban nicotine earlier?",
      "Progress during the Trump administration halted after then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stepped down from the agency, according to a former top-ranking official.",
      "\"We had no champion. And the day came when I was told by political appointees at FDA to stop talking about menthol and nicotine in my speeches. And we were basically told to stop working on them,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products from 2013 to 2022.",
      "The FDA's tobacco arm turned to other priorities in those years, Zeller said. The agency was facing a surge in youth e-cigarette use that began around 2018.",
      "Zeller credited Gottlieb for advocating for the nicotine regulation within the Trump White House, after the Obama administration had fallen short. Obama officials had promised Zeller they would back rules to curb nicotine and menthol.",
      "\"If you look back on the record, you'll see that the Obama administration did absolutely nothing. It was a very frustrating four years,\" Zeller said.",
      "Under President Biden, Zeller said the White House asked him to lay out a timeline for how a nicotine rule could be finalized by the end of 2024. Zeller said he delivered the plan in one of his last acts before retiring, and was not sure why the Biden administration failed to finalize the rule.",
      "\"I would not be forwarding this timeline to you, if I didn't believe in good conscience that it could be met, as long as clearance times could be sped up,\" Zeller recalled telling White House officials.",
      "Califf defended the agency's delay in comments to media Wednesday, saying that the FDA needed to lay the groundwork for steep legal fights over the rule. He pointed to ongoing court battles \"fighting us tooth and nail\" over graphic warnings on cigarettes, saying \"we will be sued, on anything that comes into action.\"",
      "\"The research has to be airtight to survive the challenges that we know we'll get in court,\" he said.",
      "How can nicotine be removed from cigarettes?",
      "Zeller said agency officials carefully studied whether it was possible to require the industry to make cigarettes without addictive levels of nicotine.",
      "\"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Philip Morris sold a very low-nicotine cigarette called Next. Now, it was not commercially successful. But I believe that Philip Morris more than 30 years ago answered the technical feasibility question for themselves and for the rest of us,\" he said.",
      "The Philip Morris cigarette had been produced with a similar process to decaffeinating coffee. At the time, the company had owned Kraft Foods and its decaf coffee production lines.",
      "A major study from the National Institutes of Health in 2015\u00a0that used reduced-nicotine cigarettes that the NIH contracted to manufacture showed reducing nicotine in cigarettes could substantially curb addiction, proving an idea first outlined in the 1990s.",
      "\"That study and a number of confirmatory studies that followed I think provide a very compelling scientific basis for this could be done,\" Zeller said.",
      "Other companies have found different ways to cut nicotine levels. Cigarette company 22nd Century Group earned the FDA's authorization in 2021 using tobacco that is genetically engineered to have 96% lower nicotine.",
      "While feasible to implement, Zeller predicted that finalizing the rule could face steep opposition from the industry.",
      "If successful, the rule would be an \"existential threat,\" he said, eliminating the main reason that smokers continue to use their products.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:31:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The red food dye is used in products ranging from candies to vegetarian meats.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday it had decided to revoke Red 3's authorization to be added to foods, over concerns about how the food coloring dye has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.",
      "FDA officials have telegraphed the decision for months. While the agency has long said that it did not think evidence of Red 3 causing cancer applied to humans, officials said their hand was forced by a law requiring the agency to pull additives that are cancerous in animals.",
      "\"The Delaney Clause is clear; the FDA cannot authorize a food additive or color additive if it has been found to cause cancer in humans or animals. Evidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No. 3,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, referring to the law.",
      "A post on the FDA's website states that Red 3's use in food or drugs \"puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.\"",
      "Hundreds of food brands, including products ranging from candy and fruit cups to snack chips and tomato sauce, have contained Red 3 at some point, according to databases maintained by the\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0and the nonprofit\u00a0Environmental Working Group, as well as nutrition labels disclosed by food companies.",
      "Wednesday's decision stems from a petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a number of other groups in 2022, calling for the additive to be pulled from the market. Food brands will have until January 2027 to stop using the dye.",
      "The group has also championed a move by California in 2023 to ban the food dye, which is already banned from use in cosmetics.",
      "\"The primary purpose of food dyes is to make candy, drinks, and other processed foods more attractive. When the function is purely aesthetic, why accept any cancer risk?\" said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in a statement.",
      "While the group has highlighted Red 3's link to cancer in pushes to ban the additive, it is concerns over a different health concern \u2014 the possibility that artificial food dyes could be causing hyperactivity in children \u2014 that has fueled opposition to this and another dye called Red 40 used in many U.S. food products.",
      "An influential review by California''s Environmental Protection Agency of studies on synthetic food dyes, including Red 3, concluded in 2021 that colorants \"can impact neurobehavior in some children.\"",
      "What foods and drinks contain Red 3?",
      "Red 3 has been authorized for use in at least some foods by countries around the world, according to the International Association of Color Manufacturers, under other names like erythrosine or E 127. In Europe, Red 3 is only permitted for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries.",
      "In the U.S., Red 3 is used in some candies, including Jelly Belly's Candy Corn, Tootsie's Dubble Bubble ball gum and Ring Pop's strawberry and berry blast flavors. Other foods also use Red 3, like Del Monte cherry mixed fruit cups, MorningStar Farms vegetarian Bacon Strips and Pillsbury's birthday cake cookie dough.",
      "Several drinks rely on Red 3 as well, among them Ensure's creamy peach nutrition shake and Nesquik's strawberry lowfat milk.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the candy industry pledged to comply with the FDA's guidance and safety standards. Industry groups have been calling on the agency to step up its regulation of food additives, citing concerns that a vacuum left by FDA inaction could lead to a frustrating patchwork of state laws for national food brands.",
      "\"Our consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework. We have been saying for years that FDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety,\" said the National Confections Association's statement.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the federal department that will oversee the FDA, has been critical of the agency for not moving to curb use of certain food additives.",
      "Kennedy and his allies have\u00a0also called for\u00a0tightening the FDA's approach to regulating food additives, which critics have derided as a \"loophole\" allowing in concerning ingredients.

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 07:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The death risk goes up to 1 in 100 for those who drink alcohol nine times per week, the report found.",
    "story": [
      "Consuming more than one drink a day results in a steep increase of the risk of premature death, a new federal review has concluded. The draft report was published Tuesday ahead of a major update to influential federal guidelines on how much alcohol Americans should drink.",
      "\"In the United States, males and females have a 1 in 1000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. This risk increases to 1 in 100 if they consume more than 9 drinks per week,\" the report's authors concluded, in a final draft published by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The review is one of two written by committees of outside experts to inform this year's update to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The other was published last month by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.",
      "The upcoming guidelines are important because the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies often rely on the recommendations to justify new rules, like on how to label food and drinks. Men are currently recommended to limit intake to no more than two drinks per day and women are recommended to limit to one drink per day.",
      "\"Once you're over a drink a day, your risk of dying from alcohol is already above one percent. Some people may think that doesn't sound like a lot, but in terms of a public health guideline, that would be really, really high,\" said Dr. Timothy Naimi, director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research and one of the authors of the report.",
      "Naimi was careful to say that the report was \"not endorsing any level of risk\" caused by drinking, but pointed to other countries and health regulations that have used 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 death risks as thresholds to set rules.",
      "It is unclear whether the incoming Trump administration will incorporate the findings of the latest report into any updated guidelines. In 2020, the Trump administration rejected a call by its outside expert panel to recommend limiting drinking for all Americans to no more than once per day, saying the \"emerging evidence\" did not support the move.",
      "The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade coalition that represents spirits producers, called in a statement co-signed by other industry groups on the federal government to reject the findings of the panel.",
      "\"Today's report is the product of a flawed, opaque and unprecedented process, rife with bias and conflicts of interest,\" the statement said,\" accusing some of the experts on the federal panel of having ties to international anti-alcohol advocacy organizations.",
      "\"Congress never authorized or appropriated money for the panel or its work, and numerous letters from Congress and industry have voiced serious concerns over the process,\" the statement said.",
      "Alcohol linked to deaths from cancer, injuries, other causes",
      "The report was designed to weigh all of the data on a range of diseases and injuries, and boiled down a complex web of studies that have looked at alcohol's health risks and benefits into \"alcohol-attributable death\" estimates.",
      "This modeling is likely underestimating the true health risks of alcohol, Naimi said, given limits in how researchers can study its health impacts.",
      "Risks can also vary widely from person to person, the report cautions, meaning some harms can be very small for some even if they add up to substantial risks at the public health level.",
      "\"The overall effect of alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality is dependent upon the risk of diseases and injuries that are causally related to alcohol. These risks are affected by numerous factors, including smoking, diet, physical activity, obesity, hepatitis infection, and genetics,\" the report states.",
      "At one drink a day, the report estimated that injuries and cancer added up to the biggest contributors of the risk for a premature death.",
      "For men, injuries made up a substantial portion of the risk of dying. This includes a variety of accidents, road injuries and intentional harm, like suicide and violence linked to drinking.",
      "Cancer, which was next largest factor, made up a third of the additional risk of death for men.",
      "For women consuming one drink a day, the risk of death from cancer was statistically similar or larger compared to the increased risk of fatal injuries.",
      "Increased risk of a number of cancers \u2014 colorectal, female breast cancer, and cancers of the liver, mouth, throat and esophagus \u2014 \"begins with any alcohol use and increases with higher levels of use,\" the report states.",
      "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued an advisory earlier this month calling for a warning about the risk of cancer to be included on alcoholic beverages.",
      "Liver disease poses the next highest risk, and can be especially risky for people with other underlying conditions like hepatitis C that make people vulnerable.",
      "One risk that was lower in people drinking once per day, compared with never drinking, was for ischemic stroke. But that apparent benefit virtually disappears at two drinks per day.",
      "\"Drinking at levels that many people have considered to be, quote, moderate, may in fact be moderately risky or may not be moderate in terms of the health risk,\" said Naimi.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 16:38:18 -0500",
    "summary": "It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to finalize the rule on food labels.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration released on Tuesday its long-awaited proposal to require food manufacturers to put some nutrition facts on the front of packages, in a bid to nudge Americans and food companies towards healthier diets in line with similar pushes in other countries.",
      "FDA's new \"nutrition info box\" focuses on telling people whether levels of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar are \"high\" or \"medium\" or \"low\" as well as the percentage for each serving.",
      "The proposal will be open for public comment for 120 days. It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize the rule.",
      "After that, the FDA says that large food companies earning more than $10 million annually will have three years to comply with the rule. Smaller food brands will have an additional year.",
      "Up to $154 million will be spent by the food industry over the next decade to relabel their products with the new box, the FDA estimates.",
      "The agency also estimates many food brands may also spend millions more dollars to try to rework their products, changing their recipes to avoid being called out as having too much of an unhealthy nutrient.",
      "\"We assume there may be manufacturers who would want to reformulate to maybe move from the high category into the medium category, or the medium category into the low category,\" Rebecca Buckner, the associate deputy director for human food policy at the FDA, told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Trump's pick to head the federal department that oversees the FDA, has been sharply critical of federal nutrition officials for not doing enough to help Americans eat healthier diets and crack down on the food industry.",
      "Kennedy has not specifically addressed the proposal. A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Why only saturated fat, sodium and added sugars?",
      "The FDA said it will require the box to only call out saturated fat, sodium and added sugars. Food manufacturers would not be able to put other nutrients inside the FDA's information box.",
      "They cited research showing that \"simpler schemes are easier for consumers to understand\" for narrowing the box down to just these three worrying unhealthy nutrients.",
      "Designs they tested with focus groups that included nutrients Americans need more of, like fiber and calcium, confused participants.",
      "The FDA said it is still weighing whether calories should be incorporated into the label and acknowledged that some food brands are already voluntarily listing the information on the front.",
      "What determines \"high,\" \"medium\" and \"low\" levels?",
      "FDA officials said Tuesday that levels of saturated fat, sodium or added sugars will be deemed as \"high\" if they are above 20% in the daily value, a measurement of how much Americans eat each day in the \"reference\" diet. Medium was set at between 6% and 19% of the daily value. And low is 5% and below.",
      "Agency officials have used these benchmarks for \"high\" and \"low\" for decades, dating back to the formulation of the nutrition facts label back in the 1990s.",
      "At the time, officials decided against including the \"interpretive descriptions\" in the nutrition facts label. But the agency said recent data shows many Americans do not understand the percentages.",
      "\"It's really based on longstanding usage,\" McKinnon said.",
      "What will it look like?",
      "The FDA says food makers will be required to put the labels \"somewhere in the top third\" of the front of the box.",
      "The box also uses the same Helvetica font used in the nutrition facts on the back of the package and must comply with a range of more detailed rules to avoid it from being too small or obscured by other designs on the package.",
      "Some other design decisions were also abandoned during the focus group testing process, the FDA said.",
      "For example, previous mockups using the colors red, yellow and green to call out different levels did not make a statistically significant difference in helping people interpret the box.",
      "Editor's note: A previous version of this article misstated the number of days the public comment period is open. It is 120 days.",

      "The\u00a0inspection records, released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests from The Associated Press and other news organizations, appear similar to some of the issues found at the Jarrett, Virginia, plant that was shuttered after at least 10 people died from Boar's Head products contaminated with listeria.",
      "The plants \u2014 located in New Castle, Indiana; Forrest City, Arkansas; and Peterburg, Virginia \u2014 were cited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for issues such as mold on ceilings, floors and walls, \"unidentified slime\" and \"an abundance of insects.\" The problems cited by USDA inspectors at the three plants date back as far as 2019, according to the documents.",
      "Boar's Head didn't immediately respond to a request from CBS News for comment.

    "summary": "Officials have blamed a new strain for this winter's surge in norovirus cases.",
    "story": [
      "This winter's wave of norovirus infections has reached levels that are now more than double last season's peak, in figures published Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracking the notorious stomach bug.",
      "Nearly 28% of norovirus tests run over the week of the New Year's holiday came back positive for the highly contagious virus, which is the leading cause of foodborne illness like vomiting and diarrhea in the U.S.",
      "That is more than double the 13.52% of tests coming back positive reached during the peak of last season's wave in March, according to data from public health laboratories around the country tallied by the CDC.",
      "Labs usually test samples of sick people's stool for the virus, which can be diagnosed up to 10 days after symptoms begin. The virus can also be found in other samples, including contaminated food or drinks that can spread the virus.",
      "Rates of norovirus in that CDC system have reached levels at or above last season's peak in all regions of the country. Norovirus test positivity rates look to be the worst in the Midwest, in a grouping of states spanning Kansas through Michigan.",
      "Since most people sick with norovirus get better without needing to go to the doctor, a majority of cases go unreported in the U.S. Instead, health authorities and experts use other measurements, such as the rate of positive tests, to track trends of the virus.",
      "Data from WastewaterSCAN's sewer sampling also suggests norovirus rates in recent weeks have been highest in the Midwest as well as the Northeast. Figures published by private testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also above previous seasonal peaks for norovirus.",
      "Why are norovirus cases so high in 2025?",
      "While norovirus rates always worsen during the colder months, in recent years most trends tracking norovirus did not reach their peak until March or April.",
      "That's different from seasons leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, which scrambled many usual seasonal patterns of germs. During that time, norovirus outbreaks often reached peak levels as early as December and January.",
      "Experts say this year's early and steep surge of cases is being driven by a new strain of norovirus called GII.17[P17], which has displaced a previous strain that had dominated previous waves of the virus in the U.S. for a decade.",

      "Why are bird flu cases high right now in poultry?",
      "U.S. officials brace every winter for upticks in bird flu because migrating wild birds that spread the virus fly south during the colder months.",
      "It's also easier for the virus to spread in the winter. Heat and sunlight degrade the virus on surfaces, the USDA says.",
      "This winter has been different because a strain of the bird flu virus has spilled over into dairy herds too, leading to hundreds of infected herds.",
      "Authorities suspect the virus has been hitching a ride in droplets of contaminated raw milk. Those are ferried between farms by workers' clothing, equipment and animals shared between farms.",
      "California has been hit especially hard in recent months, forcing the state to declare a state of emergency to try to respond to the bird flu outbreak.",
      "This winter's surge of bird flu is from a different virus than the uptick of seasonal flu infections that also drives humans to emergency rooms every winter.",
      "While bird flu led to millions of dead poultry over the past year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied only 66 confirmed human cases in the U.S. from bird flu viruses.",
      "Most American cases of bird flu have been mild. A majority were farm workers who were infected after close contact with animals infected by a bird flu strain that spilled over into dairy cows in late 2023.",
      "Researchers think\u00a0this bird flu strain mutated to be milder to humans than other variants spreading in the wild. Those other strains usually cause more severe disease when they jump into humans.",
      "Can animals be vaccinated for bird flu?",
      "The USDA announced this week it is drawing up a new stockpile of poultry vaccines. That vaccine will target the D1.1 strain of the virus, which has been spreading in wild birds and was recently to blame for a fatal human case in Louisiana.",
      "But officials said it's unlikely the vaccine will be used. The Biden administration has been weighing the possibility of vaccinating poultry for bird flu for years.",
      "That is different from plans to potentially vaccinate cows for bird flu, which the USDA says appears \"more feasible and more likely to be successful\" in battling the virus. Seven potential vaccines are now being tested in field safety trials, the department said.",
      "One major hurdle has been the fear that vaccines will only hide the symptoms of the otherwise highly lethal disease in birds. That could result in export restrictions from countries afraid the virus could spread to them through poultry products.",
      "In 2023, the USDA banned imports of some products from Europe after authorities announced they would start vaccinating some poultry for bird flu.",
      "Spread of the virus through contaminated meat in the U.S. has already happened during this year's outbreak at least twice: raw pet food made from sick animals was linked to an outbreak that killed cats in California and Oregon.",
      "A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson told CBS News that the agency is now urging the animal food supply chain to take steps to curb the threat of the virus spreading, including heat treatment to kill off the virus and avoiding using infected animals.",
      "\"All recent detections of H5N1 in cats had these things in common: the infected cats ate wild birds, unpasteurized milk, raw poultry, and/or raw poultry pet food,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 21:39:00 -0500",
    "summary": "More than a hundred E. coli cases were linked to contaminated onions produced by Taylor Farms used in McDonald's burgers.",
    "story": [
      "Food and Drug Administration officials turned up dozens of violations at a McDonald's supplier linked to a deadly outbreak of E. coli that led to more than a hundred infections and a sweeping recall of onions used in the fast food chain's products, including its Quarter Pounder burgers.",
      "The violations, detailed in an inspection report released to CBS News in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, were seen during an inspection of a food production facility in Colorado run by Taylor Farms.",
      "Their findings amounted to the FDA issuing the McDonald's supplier a so-called Form 483, a list of citations over conditions inspectors worried could be \"injurious to health.\"",
      "That facility had been tasked with supplying \"slivered onions\" to McDonald's restaurants across a broad swath of states. Taylor Farms also produces a number of other products, including salads it sells in grocery stores as safe and ready to eat.",
      "For restaurants, Taylor Farms\u00a0bills its products\u00a0as a \"prep-less kitchen solution,\" allowing food service workers to skip the usual preparation steps they would need to use with ordinary produce that should be washed and cut before eating.",
      "\"We hold our suppliers to the highest expectations and standards of food safety. Prior to this inspection, and unrelated to its findings, McDonald's stopped sourcing from Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility,\" McDonald's said in a statement.",
      "The company pointed to its October announcement\u00a0following the outbreak that it would stop buying onions from Taylor Farms in Colorado \"indefinitely,\" switching suppliers for some 900 restaurants that had relied on the plant.",
      "\"Taylor Farms is confident in our best-in-class food safety processes, and in turn, the quality and safety of our products. As is common following an inspection, FDA issued observations of conditions that could be improved at one of our facilities,\" Taylor Farms said in a statement.",
      "The company \"immediately took steps to address\" the issues, the statement said, and added that the FDA classified\u00a0the inspection as not resulting in \"administrative or regulatory action\" against the company.",
      "\"This is consistent with the fact that no illnesses or public health threat has been linked to these observations,\" Taylor Farms said.",
      "Taylor Farms ultimately recalled thousands of cases of ready-to-eat onions that it had distributed to food service facilities in six states following the outbreak.",
      "At least 104 cases of E. coli infections were linked to the outbreak, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including 34 hospitalizations and one death.",
      "\"Should have been marked as a 'fail'\"",
      "FDA inspectors said they discovered \"numerous equipment with apparent biofilm and large amounts of food debris\" around the Taylor Farms facility in Colorado Springs, even after workers had supposedly completed their required cleaning procedures.",
      "The FDA said that Taylor Farms quality control officials had signed off on cleaning at the facility as passing, even when agency inspectors said they could still see \"several food contact surfaces that were not visually clean and should have been marked as a 'Fail'.\"",
      "Food debris building up on the company's equipment was so bad that it was leading to cross-contamination, the FDA's inspectors worried. A company that had been buying green peppers from Taylor Farms complained that onions had found their way into their ready-to-eat product.",
      "Workers were also cutting corners on required sanitation steps for themselves, the FDA's inspectors alleged.",
      "Staff at the McDonald's supplier only \"sometimes\" used hand sanitizer when handling food that was supposed to be ready-to-eat or \"RTE,\" as the industry calls it, on their gloved hands.",
      "\"Production employees handling RTE produce and food contact surfaces were not observed using any of the handwashing sinks in the facility,\" the FDA's inspectors wrote.",
      "\"Equipment is constantly wet\"",
      "The FDA's inspectors also discovered Taylor Farms was frequently skipping the drying step after dunking tools into a solution of sanitizing chemicals, which inspectors feared was resulting in the solution being \"directly applied\" to ready-to-eat produce.",
      "\"Equipment is constantly wet due to the wet processing environment and cold temperatures,\" agency inspectors wrote.",
      "Instructions from the manufacturer of the cleaning solution urged users to air-dry sanitized utensils, the FDA said.",
      "FDA officials also worried about how staff were cooking up the cleaning chemical mixtures that they were using.",
      "Some solutions tested above the maximum concentration of chemicals that were allowed, while the company wasn't sure how it came up for the recipe of another cleaning concoction it was using that FDA inspectors questioned.",
      "\"Management could not provide a manufacturer label and/or manufacturers/chemical representatives claiming that mixing these chemicals listed above was designed for this use,\" inspectors said.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 05:00:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

      "\"This goes beyond a failure of responsibility; it is gross negligence in an area highly vulnerable to wildfires, especially with well-documented weather alerts and high wind risks,\" said Patrick McNicholas, an attorney at McNicholas & McNicholas. \"We are committed to holding Southern California Edison accountable for their alleged negligence and to seeking justice for victims who have lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones.\"",
      "In an\u00a0incident report\u00a0sent to the California Public Utilities Commission, SoCal Edison disputed the claim that its equipment started the fire, citing \"no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire.\"",
      "\"To date, no fire agency has suggested that SCE's electric facilities were involved in the ignition or requested the removal and retention of any SCE equipment,\" SoCal Edison wrote in its report.",
      "\"SCE understands that a lawsuit related to the Eaton fire has been filed but has not yet been served with the complaint. SCE will review the complaint when it is received. The cause of the fire continues to be under investigation,\" said spokesperson for Southern California Edison.",
      "Additionally, in a statement from last week, SoCal Edison said that the distribution lines immediately to the west of Eaton Cayon were energized well before the reported start time of the fire as part of its public safety power shutoff program.",

      "Filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf of residents and a pizzeria owner in the stricken area, the complaint filed against the LADWP contends the country's biggest municipal utility should have kept water in the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which it contended had stood empty for nearly a year.",
      "\"The water supply system servicing Pacific Palisades failed miserably, leaving residents and firefighters with little to no water to fight the blaze,\" Roger Behle, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, said on Tuesday in a statement.",
      "In defending the water system, LADWP cited \"unprecedented and extreme water demand to fight the wildfire without aerial support\" for the dearth of water pressure. Some hydrants in high elevations were affected, but the utility \"immediately deployed water tankers\" to back the firefighting efforts.",
      "LADWP is initiating its own investigation \"about water resiliency and how we can enhance our posture to respond to the impacts of climate change,\" the utility said in a statement.",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, the fires across the LA area had killed at least\u00a025 people, destroyed more than 12,000 structures and charred more than 60 square miles. The largest by far \u2014 the\u00a0Palisades\u00a0and Eaton\u00a0wildfires\u00a0\u2014 continue to burn out of control, officials said.",

      "The coffee giant said on Monday that a new code of conduct \u2013 which will be posted in all company-owned North American stores \u2013 will also ban discrimination or harassment, consumption of outside alcohol, smoking, vaping, drug use and panhandling.",
      "The new rules reverse an open-door policy put in place in 2018, after two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks where they had gone for a business meeting. The incident at that individual store, which had a policy of asking non-paying customers to leave, was caught on video and was a major embarrassment for the company.",
      "The change also comes under the new leadership of Brian Niccol, who was hired from Chipotle last year to revitalize the struggling coffee chain. Niccol has vowed to make Starbucks' locations \"inviting places to linger,\" with the goal of reestablishing the chain as the nation's \"community coffeehouse.\"",
      "Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said the new rules are designed to help prioritize paying customers. Anderson said most other retailers already have similar rules.",
      "\"We want everyone to feel welcome and comfortable in our stores,\" Anderson said. \"By setting clear expectations for behavior and use of our spaces, we can create a better environment for everyone.\"",
      "According to a company statement emailed to CBS News, the coffee chain understands that visitors might need to use the restroom or log into Wi-Fi before making a purchase at the counter. The goal of the new rules is to make its locations more appealing by prioritizing customers, Starbucks said.",
      "Starbucks said it will also start offering free refills of hot or iced coffee on Jan. 27 for customers who decide to stay in a store to drink their beverages.

    "story": [
      "Inflation rose 2.9% on an annual basis in December, with the latest Consumer Price Index illustrating the Federal Reserve's challenge in battling stickier-than-expected price increases.",
      "Last month's CPI was forecast to come in at 2.8%, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "Still, there are some signs of progress in the Fed's inflation battle. Core CPI, or prices excluding the volatile energy and food costs, rose 3.2% on an annual basis, lower than the 3.3% rate expected by economists. It also marked the smallest increase in core CPI since July 2024, according to PNC Financial Services Group.",
      "The Federal Reserve began cutting rates in September following a flurry of hikes that helped tame inflation after it hit a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022. Yet the Fed has struggled with the last leg of its inflation battle in pushing the CPI to a 2% annual rate, and December's reading could convince the central bank to hold off on another rate cut at its next meeting, scheduled for Jan. 29.",
      "Good signs on inflation",
      "The cooler-than-expected core CPI data reassured Wall Street that inflation isn't on a renewed upward trend, according to economists at High Frequency Economics in a research note. Stock gained on Wednesday morning, with the S&P 500 rising 95 points, or 1.6%, to 5,937 in early trading.",
      "\"There surely is no evidence of either a crash in prices \u2014 as one might expect to see in a crashing economy \u2014 or a renewal of upward pressure on prices,\" they wrote.",
      "Given the mixed inflation data, some economists predicted the Fed is likely to hold off on a rate hike at its Jan. 29 meeting, although they added that the improvement in the core CPI bolsters the possibility of cuts later in 2025.",
      "\"After recent red-hot data, today's softer-than-expected core CPI reading should help cool fears of a reacceleration in inflation,\" said Tina Adatia, head of fixed income client portfolio management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email. \"While today's release is likely insufficient to put a January rate cut back on the table, it strengthens the case that the Fed's cutting cycle has not yet run its course.\"",

      "That could come as consumers are continuing to feel the pinch of higher costs. Prices in December accelerated due to higher gasoline prices, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing, according to the report released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "While Wall Street is interpreting the December report favorably, the CPI report signals \"little relief to most consumers,\" noted David Royal, chief financial and investment officer at financial services company Thrivent, in an email. \"Food prices, which had been tame in the first half of 2024, continued their acceleration, increasing 0.3% in December.\"",

      "Musk started buying shares of Twitter, which he later renamed X, in early 2022. By mid-March, he'd acquired ownership of more than 5% of the company's outstanding stock, according to the SEC filing. He was required to file a report with the SEC disclosing his purchases, but the lawsuit alleges he failed to do so in a \"timely\" manner, allowing him to underpay other investors by at least $150 million for shares they bought during that period.",

    "summary": "The CFPB is suing Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts.",
    "story": [
      "Capital One was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts. As a result, customers lost more than $2 billion in potential interest payments, the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a complaint filed Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took aim at Capital One's promises and handling of its \"360 Savings\" accounts, which were promoted as accounts providing one of the highest interest rates in the nation. But instead, the CFPB alleges, Capital One froze its rate at a low level for at least several years, even as rates rose nationally.",
      "At the same time, the CFPB adds, the bank created \"360 Performance Savings,\" which had a much higher rate \u2014 at one point, more than 14 times higher than the original \"360 Savings\" accounts. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates, part of its effort to fight soaring inflation. As a result, some banks have rolled out high-interest savings accounts to attract savers.",
      "But at the same time, some banks haven't boosted rates on their savings accounts, creating a gap between low-and top-paying accounts, similar to that of Capital One's two offerings. According to the CFPB, Capital One marketed the products similarly to obscure their distinction and forbade employees \"from proactively telling\" those with 360 Savings accounts about the higher-paying 360 Performance Savings, the agency said.",
      "\"Capital One did not specifically notify 360 Savings account holders about the new product, and instead worked to keep them in the dark about these better-paying accounts,\" the CFPB said in a statement. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates to fight soaring inflation, which allowed banks to roll out high-interest savings accounts after years of meager rates.",
      "In response, Capital One said that it strongly disagreed with the CFPB's allegations and plans to \"vigorously defend\" itself in court. The banking giant added that it was \"deeply disappointed to see the CFPB continue its recent pattern of filing eleventh-hour lawsuits ahead of a change in administration.\"",
      "Capital One also maintained that all of its 360 banking products \"offer great rates\" \u2014 and have \"always been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions.\"",
      "Billions in lost interest",
      "These actions mean Capital One \"illegally avoided paying billions in interest to millions of consumers,\" the CFPB wrote in its Tuesday complaint. The agency says it's seeking to impose civil penalties and provide financial relief to those impacted.",
      "\"Banks should not be baiting people with promises they can't live up to,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a prepared statement.",
      "According to disclosures on the Capital One's website, 360 Savings accounts currently carry an interest rate of just under 0.50%. 360 Performance Savings accounts have an interest rate of about 3.74%.",
      "That means the rate for 360 Performance Savings is nearly 7.5 times higher than that of 360 Savings today. But the CFPB says they've been farther apart in the past. In July 2024, the agency notes in Tuesday's complaint, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times that of 360 Savings.",
      "The CFPB alleges that Capital One kept the rate for its 360 Savings accounts at 0.30% between December 2020 through at least August 2024.

      "\"Need to act fast here. All neighbors houses burning. Will pay any amount,\" he added.",
      "City and county fire departments have been stretched thin, as they continue to battle the wind-fueled fires across Los Angeles that as of Monday have scorched more than 60 square miles\u00a0of land, killing at least 24 people and displacing tens of thousands. Municipal resources, like fire hydrants, have run dry in some areas.",
      "Those who can afford to do so are reaching out to private firefighting crews in hopes of saving their homes from the furious wildfires.",

      "Some of the company's firefighters also work for county fire departments. Others are retired from active duty, according to the company, which offers different levels of protective services ranging in price from $2,500 to $14,000.",
      "Clients called on All Risk Shield before the fires reached their properties to try and protect their homes from encroaching flames.",
      "\"We deployed our teams to these high-risk properties we knew the fire was going to possibly reach, and we were on the ground before the fire even made it to that area,\" Torres said. That included fighting fires from homeowners' properties, using residents' resources like pools, spas, rainwater tanks and water tanks to extinguish flames, in addition to the company's own fire retardants. Torres noted that the company never relies on municipal resources, like fire hydrants, to serve private clients.",
      "He added that the company operates completely independently from Los Angeles County Fire Department, but that \"indirectly, we are helping each other.\"",
      "\"Our teams have been working alongside municipal firefighters in this event,\" he said.",
      "The National Wildfire Suppression Association (NWSA), which represents private firefighter services, said that contractors often join forces with local, state and federal firefighting efforts. Contracts with private home and land owners account for a small share of business for these types of companies; the bulk of contracts comes from providing supplemental personnel and equipment to local, state and federal firefighting efforts, according to the NWSA.",
      "Fire prevention and mitigation contractors also do work for insurance companies performing tasks to reduce fire risks, such as clearing undergrowth, trimming or removing trees near homes, and applying fire retardants. A growing segment of the industry, this work typically occurs during the off-season and not in response to active fires.",
      "An \"all hands on deck\" situation",
      "The association, which represents 369 private firefighting companies across the country, confirmed that its members have directed personnel and other resources toward containing the Los Angeles wildfires. Combined, its member organizations can pool up to 11,000 professionally trained wildland firefighters.",
      "\"The size and scale of these fires and the devastation left in their wake require an all-hands-on-deck approach to suppression, restoration and future prevention, including state, federal and private resources,\" the NWSA said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0later this month if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "Specifically, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok. If ByteDance had started the process to sell TikTok, the president also could push pause on adoption of the law for 90 days.",
      "On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Elon Musk could buy TikTok's U.S. operations, effectively allowing the app to evade a ban. Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to ever sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "The Supreme Court on Jan. 11 heard arguments from government attorneys, who say TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security, and from lawyers for the social media platform. Experts said the justices seemed receptive to the government's case, increasing the likelihood of a ban. Here's what that would mean for TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

      "John McDonagh has driven a cab for more than 40 years. He's also a playwright and radio host, and is not a fan of the plan. \"It will not reduce congestion here,\" McDonagh said. \"The street designs of New York now, we have a bus lane on one side, we got a bike lane on the other, concrete barriers. So, 10 cars gives you congestion.\"",
      "But with the money going to improve public transport, that will help everybody, right?",
      "McDonagh replied, \"Oh, it does? We had a woman that was burned on the subway. We had people being pushed onto the tracks. There's robberies. And if you take the subway in New York, jumping the turnstile now is an Olympic sport.\"",
      "It's called turnstile jumping \u2013 or more politely, \"fare evasion\" \u2013 and the MTA projects it will lose $800 million a year because of it, around the same figure congestion pricing may bring in.",
      "And then there is fare evasion on buses. According to the MTA, 47 percent of riders aren't paying.",
      "\"The MTA has now installed cameras so that they can catch people,\" said Kathy Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which mobilizes business leaders to help the city thrive. \"They are providing police, even the National Guard is in our system to make sure the people pay their fare.\"",
      "Wylde is a longtime advocate for congestion pricing, and has advice for other American cities: \"You have to explain the benefits clearly,\" she said. \"You have to have transit options in most cases. Otherwise, it's just another tax, because if somebody has no choice, they're gonna resist.",
      "\"The lesson from London [is], they put in 200 new bus routes before they turned on congestion pricing,\" Wylde said. \"And that was how they got the public to accept it. They had a choice.\"",
      "It's hard to tell how it's working in New York City after a week, but according to Wylde, \"We're very excited that, in just a few days of congestion pricing, we're seeing a significant reduction in traffic already.\"",
      "Yet, the battle may not be over in New York. Among its opponents: once and future president Donald Trump. Wylde isn't worried, though. \"President Trump has property in New York,\" she said. \"He, I'm sure, has been stuck in traffic more than a few times here. And I think having New York be a more productive city, I think he'll appreciate it.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:21:39 -0500",
    "summary": "The chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase explains why he's referred to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme; his bank's efforts to improve the lives of lower-income Americans; and his recent near-death experience.",
    "story": [
      "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, says he was not surprised that Donald Trump won the election: \"People were angry at whatever they called the state \u2013 the 'swamp.' Ineffective government. That people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously. I think it's the lecturing part of it. It's social superiority, it's the 'My way or the highway.' I traveled all over the country; I felt it wherever I went.\"",
      "I asked, \"There's a sense of gloom out there about the economy. Do you understand that?\"",
      "\"I do understand it, 'cause I think there are a lot of legitimate concerns that Americans have. For example, ineffective government, they're angry about it. They're angry about immigration. There're people with legitimate issues.\"",
      "Despite lower unemployment, a calming of inflation, and a soaring stock marker, even he says he's \"cautiously pessimistic\" about the economy. And as head of the largest bank in America, it matters what Dimon has to say about things.",
      "Listen to him on Bitcoin, which he's referred to as \"a Ponzi scheme\" and \"as useless as a pet rock\": \"We are going to have some kind of digital currency at some point. I'm not against crypto. You know, Bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value. It's used heavily by sex traffickers, money launderers, ransomware. I just don't feel great about Bitcoin. I applaud your ability to wanna buy or sell it. Just like I think you have the right to smoke, but I don't think you should smoke!\"",
      "Since he took charge of the bank 20 years ago, the company has doubled its number of employees to 320,000, and grown its assets by nearly $3 trillion. Which probably would surprise his grandparents, who came to the U.S. from Greece with little money in the early 1900s.",
      "Dimon spent much of his childhood in an apartment building in a middle-class neighborhood in Queens, New York, sharing a room with his two brothers. Revisiting the street where he grew up, Dimon noted, \"I broke my arm on those monkey bars over there.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did you ever dream when you were growing up, in a million years that you'd be running one of the biggest banks in the world?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"My dad was a stockbroker. So, I was sometimes conscious of that part of the world. But I had never met a CEO until I was in college or something like that.\"",
      "He grew up to be one of most successful CEOs in the country, processing $10 trillion a day.",
      "His bank is thriving and healthy, but Dimon, now 68, has had two major health scares. The first was throat cancer a decade ago.",
      "He says it's in remission: \"But I know a little bit more,\" he said. \"People who have been told they have cancer know a little bit more than other people. That's staring you right in the face and it may actually happen. You become a little more deliberate, a little more thoughtful. You don't want to have regrets.\"",
      "He also had a heart scare in March 2020, at the beginning of COVID. \"My heart, I just, I mean, the pain was extraordinary. I thought I heard it rip. It was an aortic dissection. I had a tear in the aorta.\" He was told he might not make it.",
      "I asked, \"Going in for surgery, you know, at least you think in your mind, 'I've lived the life I should've lived so far'?\"",
      "\"Yeah. Not enough of it, but yeah,\" Dimon laughed.",
      "He woke up after seven or eight hours on the operating table: \"The doctor told me I was one of the only people he's ever seen wake up immediately after surgery like that. I waved at my kids, who had been sitting there the whole time. And then, I was back asleep in the ICU.",
      "\"Waking up in the ICU, I mean, like, when you're a man who's never had to rely on other people really, and all of a sudden you have tubes everywhere and you can't do anything yourself, and you know, you got tubes in your heart and tubes in your lungs and tubes down your jugular\u2026\"",
      "He was in the hospital for a week, back at work a month later, and soon traveling the world, which he does, he says, 40 percent of his time.",
      "We met him in the executive suite on the 43rd floor of the bank's Manhattan headquarters. From there, he can see where he grew up \u2013 and to the left, the nearly-twice-as-high, dazzling new JPMorgan headquarters going up next door, which he says will be taller than the Empire State Building.",
      "With all the big things he deals with, it's interesting that one of the things Dimon is most proud of is opening branches in lower-income and underserved communities around the country. Visiting one branch in Harlem, he noted, \"Mortgage documentation is really hard to do. So, in one of these community branches, a guy stood up and he said he finally bought a home that he'd lived in for 30 years. He said there's no way he could have gotten that mortgage if one of our mortgage loan officers didn't call him every day for months, taking him through it, making him feel comfortable, getting the forms. He got our homeowner's grant. And it works.\"",
      "This isn't a not-for-profit; these local branches make money for the bank.",
      "But what about the other end of the spectrum? Asked about the increasing wealth of the very rich and what might be \"out of whack\" with the system, Dimon replied, \"I think you have to be very careful to say, 'What's outta whack?' You want a healthy economy, and a really healthy economy lifts up all citizens. You want to help all Americans? Grow the economy. You can wail at the moon. That's not going to grow the economy. And if there are unfair things that created some of that wealth, they should be fixed.\"",
      "\"But I'm not hearing you say, 'There's something wrong here that there are these billionaires growing like poppy.' I mean, what is it? The tax laws?\"",
      "\"If I was king for a day, I would probably change a bunch of the tax laws, too, which I'm not gonna give you specifics on. It won't reduce it as much as you seem to think it should be reduced.\"",
      "\"No. But I'm interested that you're not saying, 'This is wrong. This is not working.'\"",
      "\"I think the wrong part is that the bottom 30% didn't do better, not that the top 0.1% did so well.\"",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"They may be unrelated. What we need to do to fix it for everybody \u2026\"",
      "\"But you haven't said what's wrong at the other end?\"",
      "\"I don't know what's wrong at the other end,\" Dimon replied.",
      "Dimon himself is a billionaire. We asked him about the richest person in the world, Elon Musk. \"He's clearly an extraordinary talent,\" Dimon said. \"I mean, to look at Tesla and SpaceX, yeah, well, we should make government more efficient. Is this the way to do it? I don't know. Do I want them to succeed? Absolutely.\"",
      "\"But it's odd to have a man who's so wealthy, with so many important companies that matter to our economy and even to our national security, now sort of insinuating that he can influence right-wing politics in Europe. It doesn't sound right, does it?\"",
      "Dimon said, \"I'm not responsible for his behavior, so let him do it. But when you say it's odd, it's not that odd. It's been going on in this country for a long time. If you go back to Lindbergh, there's been more interfering in cross-Atlantic politics than you would think.\"",
      "\"Are you distressed by it?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Take it in stride?\"",
      "\"Take it in stride.\"",
      "\"Somebody called him an oligarch, an American oligarch.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's name-calling.\"",
      "Dimon has been in banking for more than 40 years, which leads to the inevitable question: When will he retire? \"Last time I was asked, I said, less than five years. But when you say retire, I'm not going to retire like that. I may write a book. I may teach. I may work with my kids, if they want. I would never pressure them to work with me.\"",
      "\"I didn't hear you say, 'I might become chairman and, you know, just give up the CEO part.'\"",
      "\"Oh, that's likely. That's likely to happen. Again, that is up to the board, not up to me. But if it makes sense, I may be chairing for a couple years.\"",
      "He says he does not know whom his successor might be. But one thing he does know: \"I love my job. I love what it does. I like our people. It motivates me. Like a lotta people, by Friday I'm exhausted. I want to go home, I want to have my martini and go to sleep! But I do love my job. I think it's great to have a purpose in life.

      "\"The 21st Century will be defined by what happens between the United States and China,\" Rubio told his Senate colleagues, reiterating his long-held belief that the U.S. must push back on China's influence more forcefully.",
      "\"They have elements that the Soviet Union never possessed,\" Rubio said. \"They are a technological adversary and competitor, an industrial competitor, an economic competitor, a geopolitical competitor, a scientific competitor now \u2014 in every realm. It is an extraordinary challenge.\"",
      "Rubio is likely to sail through the confirmation process to become the nation's top diplomat. He received a warm reception from members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is a member, who praised his extensive foreign policy experience.",
      "The confirmation hearing occurred as Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire and hostage release deal, U.S. officials said. Senate Foreign Relations chair Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican, announced at the hearing that he had been advised that a deal had been reached, with Rubio commenting that all those involved \"deserve credit for the deal.\"",
      "At times throughout the hearing, Rubio defended the decisions of his former rival, Trump, as he faced questions about the incoming president's potential conflicts of interest abroad and offered a strong defense of NATO despite Trump's past criticism of the defense alliance.",
      "\"Under President Trump, the top priority of the United States Department of State will be the United States,\" Rubio said.",
      "Like during and after the first World War, Rubio declared that the U.S. is once again \"called to create a free world out of the chaos.\"",
      "\"And this will not be easy,\" Rubio continued. \"And it will be impossible without a strong and a confident America that engages in the world, putting our core national interests, once again, above all else.\"",
      "Rubio, who has taken hardline positions on China, Iran, Venezuela and Cuba, will inherit the position facing a number of global challenges, including Russia's war in Ukraine, persistent violence in the Middle East, China's aggression against Taiwan and its tense relationship with the U.S. Trump has also suggested using military force or coercion to gain control of Greenland and the Panama Canal. He's floated annexing Canada as the 51st state and has threatened trade wars with U.S. allies.",
      "Rubio on China",
      "In the Senate, Rubio has been among the most outspoken on China, saying the nation is the \"threat that will define this century.\" Members of both parties have since adopted his positions on China.",
      "As well as warning about the national security risks, Rubio has also sought to hold China accountable for human rights abuses. In 2020, Beijing responded to Rubio's criticisms by banning him from the country. It's unclear what will become of that ban once he takes office and is tasked with carrying out Trump's foreign policy goals.",
      "Rubio told senators that much of China's growth has come at the expense of the U.S. and \"in less than 10 years, virtually everything that matters to us in life will depend on whether China will allow us to have it or not.\"",
      "\"Indeed, I've been strongly worded in my views of China. Let me just point out they've said mean things about me, too,\" Rubio said Wednesday. \"My role now as a secretary of state is to lead the diplomatic wing of the country and that will involve engaging them.\"",
      "Rubio said it was in the interest of both countries to be able to communicate to avoid an armed conflict.",
      "\"Never in the history of mankind have two powers like the United States and China ever faced off in a global conflict, and the outcome would be catastrophic, and we should want to avoid it, and so should they,\" he said.",
      "Rubio on Ukraine and NATO",
      "The Florida Republican called for an end to the war in Ukraine, which has carried on for nearly three years since Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022.",
      "\"This war has to end,\" he said, adding that there should be a \"ceasefire.\"",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the committee, asked Rubio about his seeming shift in what was once full-throated support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia. Rubio voted against a foreign aid package last April that included assistance for Ukraine, despite his earlier support for the country. During the 2024 campaign, Trump criticized the Biden administration for sending billions to Ukraine in aid.",
      "\"I voted against that bill because I said I would not vote for a bill unless it addressed the crisis at our southern border as part of the overall arrangement,\" Rubio said. \"That was not done, and so I voted against it. That said, here's my view of the situation: Once this war became what we now know it is, and that is, a war of attrition, a stalemate, a protracted conflict, the dynamic on that situation has changed. It has.\"",
      "Rubio says Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism",
      "Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, whose father fled Cuba, asked Rubio whether he believes Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism.",
      "\"Without a question,\" Rubio responded.",
      "A day before Rubio's confirmation hearing, the Biden administration announced it is moving to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism and ease economic restrictions as part of a deal for the release of political prisoners.",
      "Rubio, a supporter of strong sanctions on Havana's Communist regime, said it has been friendly towards Hamas and Hezbollah, hosts espionage stations for two countries hostile to the U.S., has strong ties to Iran and harbors fugitives from the American justice system.",
      "\"So there is zero doubt in my mind that they meet all the qualifications for being a state sponsor of terrorism,\" he said.",
      "Asked whether he would reverse the Biden administration's determination, Rubio said that was ultimately Trump's call but said \"nothing that was agreed to is irreversible or binding on the new administration.\"",
      "Panama Canal and Greenland",
      "The Panama Canal and Greenland, which have both received recent attention from Trump, were also topics of interest during the hearing.",
      "\"President Trump is not inventing this,\" Rubio said of questions about whether the canal remains neutral. \"This is something that's existed now for at least a decade.\"",
      "During a trip to Panama in 2017, Rubio said Chinese companies' control of port facilities on either end of the canal was \"the central issue\" discussed.",
      "\"This is a legitimate issue that needs to be confronted,\" he said.",
      "On Greenland, Rubio said the Denmark-owned territory has been \"strategically important\" to the U.S. for decades.",
      "Trump's potential foreign conflicts of interest",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut grilled Rubio on the potential foreign conflicts of interest that may arise between the United States' national interests and the Trump Organization's foreign business dealings.",
      "Murphy said Trump and his family have become \"more deeply dependent on revenue from governments in the Middle East,\" pointing to specific business deals.",
      "\"The Trump Organization is going to be signing new business deals in the Middle East with private companies that have connections to foreign governments at the very moment that you are going to be conducting sensitive diplomacy in these countries. That's just extraordinary,\" Murphy said. \"Never before in the history of this country has a president been, I mean literally, receiving cash from foreign governments and from foreign companies that are backed by foreign governments in the middle of their term. If you or I had done this as senators, we would be in violent violation of Senate ethics rules. That's not permitted on the Foreign Relations Committee.\"",
      "Murphy asked Rubio if he views profiting from Middle East deals as a potential conflict of interest, and whether he will bring that up with Trump. Rubio said he isn't a participant of or very familiar with Trump's overseas business deals, saying Trump's family members who are private citizens are running those companies.",
      "\"All I can tell you is that what I've said from the very beginning from the opening statement, and that is our foreign policy is going to be driven, as the president's made abundantly clear, by whether some action is in the good of the United States and our national security,\" Rubio said.",
      "Pressed further, Rubio specifically said Trump's family members have a right to conduct business deals abroad, and he doesn't believe Trump will allow personal business deals to adversely affect U.S. interests.",
      "\"The president doesn't manage that company,\" Rubio responded. \"His family members do, and they have a right to be in the business. I mean, that's the business that they're in. They're in the real estate business, they've been for a very long time, both domestically and abroad. They have properties in multiple countries. So, at the end of the day, his family is entitled to continue to operate their business.\"",
      "\"The fundamental question is not whether his family is involved in business. The fundamental question is whether that is in any way impacting the conduct of our foreign policy in a way that's counter to our national interest. And the president's made it abundantly clear that every decision he makes and every decision we are to make at the State Department should be driven by whether or not it serves the core national interests of the United States,\" he said.",
      "Who is Marco Rubio?",
      "Rubio, 53, was born in Miami to Cuban immigrants who arrived in the U.S. in May 1956. His father was a banquet bartender and his mother worked as a hotel maid. According to his Senate website, Rubio \"was drawn to public service in large part because of his grandfather, who saw his homeland destroyed by communism.\"",
      "Rubio's long political career began when he served as city commissioner in West Miami after he earned degrees from the University of Florida and the University of Miami Law School. He was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000, where he served until 2008, including two years as speaker.",
      "The Florida Republican was first elected to the Senate in 2010 and won his third six-year term in 2022. He has served on both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and as vice chair on the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
      "Rubio was among a crowded field of GOP candidates running for president in 2016. He ended his campaign after losing the primary to Trump in his home state of Florida. The two verbally sparred during the campaign, with Rubio calling Trump \"a con artist\" who was hijacking the Republican Party and \"the most vulgar person\" to ever run for president. Trump sought to diminish his rival by nicknaming him \"Little Marco.\"",
      "Still, Rubio endorsed Trump for president after dropping out of the race and the two formed a pragmatic relationship in the years since. Trump eyed Rubio as a possible running mate in the 2024 race, but settled on Sen. JD Vance of Ohio instead.",
      "Does Marco Rubio have the votes to be confirmed?",
      "Rubio is all but certain to be confirmed, even with some Democratic support. A number of Senate Democrats have praised Trump's choice and have pledged to support his nomination on the floor, giving him many more than the 50 votes he needs for confirmation, barring something unforeseen.",
      "At Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia was among the Democrats to compliment Rubio, saying he was \"extremely well-prepared.\"",
      "\"He's not talking out of a briefing book. He's not having to thumb through a binder to decide how to answer a particular question,\" Kaine said.",
      "Others spoke about their personal relationships with Rubio. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois recalled how Rubio helped push for Senate rules to be amended so that she could bring her newborn daughter with her on the floor to votes.",
      "\"What's the big deal? This place is already full of babies,\" Rubio remembered saying.",
      "Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who met with Rubio on Monday, called the Florida Republican \"a good choice\" and said he \"has a thorough understanding of the United States' role on an international scale.\"",
      "\"I plan to vote yes on his nomination when it comes before the Senate,\" Durbin, a top Senate Democrat, said in a statement.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 14:59:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Pam Bondi sought to allay the concerns of Democrats who said they feared Trump and his allies would use the Justice Department to target their political enemies.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney general, vowed to end the \"weaponization\" of the Justice Department at her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, saying her focus will be on reducing crime and upholding the law.",
      "The former Florida attorney general, who represented Trump during his first impeachment, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday to testify about her nomination, which is all but certain to be approved in the GOP-controlled Senate.",
      "She spent much of the hearing seeking to allay concerns from skeptical Democrats that Trump would use the Justice Department to target his political enemies once in office.",
      "\"There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,\" Bondi said, adding that she believes prosecutors under President Biden unfairly targeted Trump for the last four years.",
      "\"I will fight every day to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,\" she said. \"The partisanship, the weaponization, will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.\"",
      "Democrats did not seem convinced, repeatedly pressing Bondi on whether she'd investigate and prosecute figures ranging from former Rep. Liz Cheney and former special counsel Jack Smith to journalists and Trump critics.",
      "Bondi's confirmation hearing",
      "Trump selected Bondi to be his nominee for U.S. attorney general after his first pick, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration. Bondi made history in 2010 when she became the first woman to serve as Florida's attorney general, a role she held for two terms.",
      "\"If confirmed as the next attorney general of the United States, my overriding objective will be to return the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe and vigorously prosecuting criminals,\" Bondi said in her opening statement.",
      "Bondi said her time as a local prosecutor framed her goals for the Justice Department, which she described as \"getting back to the basics\" of combating crime and reducing recidivism.",
      "Republicans on the committee largely focused on Bondi's decades of crimefighting experience as a local prosecutor, and later as Florida attorney general. They claimed the Justice Department has been \"weaponized\" in recent years for political reasons, pointing to the prosecutions of Trump that have been dropped since the election.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the committee's top Democrat, noted Bondi's experience, but said it is Trump who has vowed to use the Justice Department to target his political enemies. Durbin said he wants assurances that Bondi would keep the Justice Department independent, and would be willing to say \"no\" to Trump. Trump clashed with his two attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and William Barr, over decisions they made in his first term.",
      "Durbin asked Bondi if she accepted that Trump lost the election in 2020, a fact that he and many of his prominent supporters have not publicly acknowledged. Bondi stopped short of doing so Wednesday.",
      "\"There was a peaceful transition of power. President Trump left office and was overwhelmingly elected in 2024,\" Bondi said. Bondi told Durbin that she \"accept[s] the results\" of the 2020 election but declined to say outright that Mr. Biden won.",
      "Durbin asked if Bondi would support pardons for people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Bondi said, if asked, she would review potential pardons on a \"case by case basis,\" adding: \"I condemn any violence on a law enforcement officer in this country.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, asked Bondi if she would \"be willing to resign if ordered to do something improper.\"",
      "\"Senator, I wouldn't work at a law firm, I wouldn't be a prosecutor, I wouldn't be attorney general if anyone asked me to do something improper and I felt I had to carry that out, of course I would not do that,\" Bondi said. \"That's one of the main things you learn as a young prosecutor, is to do the right thing.\"",
      "Later, she told Coons she and the president-elect have not discussed appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Mr. Biden \u2014 a threat Trump has made. Throughout the hearing, she argued she would keep the Justice Department independent from the White House, including by upholding a department policy limiting contacts with White House officials.",
      "Bondi was repeatedly pressed by Democrats about whether she would target perceived Trump foes, including Cheney and Smith, who led the dual federal investigations against Trump. During one particularly heated exchange, she declined to say if she knew of any factual predicate for investigating Cheney, and told California Sen. Adam Schiff his concerns are misplaced.",
      "\"You're all so worried about Liz Cheney, senator, you know what we should be worried about? The crime rate in California right now is through the roof,\" she said.",
      "Bondi was also asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, about the reauthorization of Section 702, a government intelligence collection tool that has come under fire from some Republicans in Congress. She said she would take a look at the issue and called Section 702 a \"very important tool.\"",
      "Bondi's nomination",
      "Bondi's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee was one of several taking place before GOP-led panels this week as Trump prepares to begin his second term in office. Republicans have indicated they plan to give substantial deference to Trump as he fills out the top ranks of his administration and are aiming to install key Cabinet officials to their posts soon after the president-elect is inaugurated Monday.",
      "Bondi spent the weeks leading up to her confirmation hearing meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, and she is not expected to face significant hurdles in the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Durbin accused Trump of using the Justice Department as his personal law firm and said he was concerned Bondi will prioritize fealty to Trump over loyalty to the Constitution. He met with Bondi last week.",
      "Bondi was term-limited in her position as Florida's attorney general and left office in 2019. While in office, she spearheaded lawsuits against the Obama administration, challenging the Affordable Care Act \u2014 known as Obamacare \u2014 and then-President Barack Obama's immigration policies.",
      "She went on to serve as an attorney and lobbyist at the firm Ballard Partners. There, she represented large corporations like General Motors, Amazon, Uber and the American Institute Against Human Trafficking, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit that tracks lobbying. And she submitted a registration with the federal government to lobby on behalf of Qatar \"regarding Qatari relations with U.S. government officials, U.S. business entities, and non-governmental audiences, in dealing with matters pertaining to combating human trafficking.\"",
      "At her hearing on Wednesday, Bondi said she was \"very proud of the work that I did\" with Qatar, telling Durbin her work was focused on \"anti-human trafficking efforts related to the World Cup.\"",
      "\"I was registered as FARA along with many members of my firm. That was the sole portion of my representation for Qatar,\" she said, referencing a federal law that requires lobbyists who work for foreign countries to register with the government.",
      "During Trump's first term, Bondi briefly left her lobbying position to serve as a member of his defense team during the first set of impeachment proceedings pursued by congressional Democrats. She defended Trump's July 2019 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, in which Trump pressured Zelenskyy to investigate Mr. Biden.",
      "The Democratic-led House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstructing a congressional investigation, making him just the third U.S. president to ever be impeached. The Republican-led Senate then acquitted him following a trial, where Bondi was part of the team representing Trump.",
      "In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, Bondi spearheaded legal efforts to challenge the results in Pennsylvania and pushed the false claim that Trump won the state. She was asked about that work in Wednesday's hearing.",
      "\"I was an advocate for the campaign, and I was on the ground in Pennsylvania and I saw many things there. But do I accept the results? Of course I do. Do I agree with what happened?\" Bondi said. \"No one from either side of the aisle should want there to be any issues with election integrity in our country. We should all want our elections to be free and fair, and the rules and the law to be followed.\"",
      "Bondi was also among the Trump allies who traveled to New York and spoke out in defense of the president-elect early last year during his \"hush money\" criminal trial. A jury convicted Trump on 34 state felony counts of falsifying business records in May and he was sentenced last week.",
      "After the Justice Department brought criminal charges against Trump in 2023, Bondi told Fox News, \"The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones. The investigators will be investigated because the deep state last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows. But now they have a spotlight on them.\"",
      "If confirmed, she will now lead that department and will have the power to look into various aspects of the investigations into Trump that were led by Smith. She will also oversee the numerous law enforcement components under the Justice Department, including the FBI and the ATF, two organizations that have been targets of the president-elect and his allies.",
      "Bondi will also oversee implementation of aspects of Trump's agency and lead the department that will defend the president-elect's actions in federal court.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:45:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Texas and 18 other states have recently enacted laws requiring pornography websites to verify the ages of their visitors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday grappled with states' efforts to require pornography websites to verify their visitors' ages amid a surge of laws that proponents say are aimed at protecting children from accessing sexual content on the internet.",
      "The requirement at the center of the case was enacted by Texas in 2023 as part of a wave of similar measures that have been passed in 18 other states. Under Texas' law, a website must use \"reasonable age verification methods\" to confirm visitors are at least 18 years old.",
      "Entities must comply with the law if more than one-third of its web content is \"sexual material harmful to minors,\" which is considered to be content that is prurient, offensive and without value to minors. Covered companies have to verify users' ages through digital identification or a government-issued ID.",
      "Violators of the age-verification requirement face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day, or fines of up to $250,000 if a violation leads to a minor accessing sexual material. Internet service providers, search engines and social media companies are effectively exempt from the law.",
      "During more than two hours of arguments, the justices seemed to agree that the government has an interest in restricting minors' access to harmful sexual material. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who has young children, acknowledged that advancements in technology have made it easier for kids to access pornography through gaming systems, tablets and smart phones. Chief Justice John Roberts, too, said technological access to pornography has \"exploded,\" and there has been a \"dramatic change\" in how it can be accessed.",
      "But the justices also expressed concern that age-verification laws like those enacted in 19 states burden adults' access to content they are legally allowed to consume and could lead to more regulations based on content.",
      "Derek Shaffer, who argued on behalf of a trade group representing the adult entertainment industry, said Texas' law is the worst among those that have been passed in recent years and called the state a \"hostile regulator.\"",
      "The case arrived at the Supreme Court after a federal district court granted a preliminary injunction blocking Texas' age-verification requirement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit then froze that decision, allowing the law to take effect. The Supreme Court in April declined to temporarily block enforcement of the law, but agreed to\u00a0agreed to take up\u00a0the legal battle months later.",
      "Challengers to the age-verification measure \u2014 a group of companies that operate pornography website and the Free Speech Coalition, the trade group \u2014 are asking the Supreme Court to toss out the 5th Circuit's ruling and restore the district court's injunction. They argued the measure violates the First Amendment because it burdens adults' access to protected speech.",
      "The posture of the case was an issue raised by several members of the court, and particularly what would happen if they wiped clean the 5th Circuit's decision. The question before the high court is whether the 5th Circuit applied the correct standard of judicial review when it evaluated Texas' age-verification law.",
      "The appeals court applied the least-stringent level of review, known as rational-basis review. Using that standard, the 5th Circuit said the law survives because of evidence showing \"the sort of damage that access to pornography does to children.\" But the law's challengers and the Biden administration argue that the appeals court should've applied the most demanding level, strict scrutiny, because it impedes adults' access to constitutionally protected speech.",
      "Rational-basis review requires laws to serve a legitimate governmental purpose and be reasonably related to that purpose. Under scrutiny scrutiny, however, the government bears the burden of showing that a law is narrowly tailored to serve a \"compelling government interest.\"",
      "\"This case matters because it's about how the government can treat speech it doesn't like, and pornography is often the canary in the coal mine for free speech. And it also matters because it's about the future of free speech online,\" Vera Eidelman, a lawyer with the ACLU, said in a press call.",
      "Opponents of the Texas law argue that if it is allowed to stand, it could have a chilling effect on adult visitors to regulated websites. Additionally, it could open users' to privacy and security risks like data breaches, which don't arise when having an ID checked in-person, they argued in court filings.",
      "Already, Pornhub, one of the largest adult content websites, blocked access in Texas last year and did the same in Florida at the start of this year after its own age-verification law took effect.",
      "\"When an adult site tries to do age verification, most people coming to that site refuse to do a face scan, biometrics, ID upload, whatever it is. There's a huge chilling effect. People don't want to do it,\" said Mike Stabile, director of public policy for the Free Speech Coalition.",
      "The trade group argued in court papers that Texas could have employed a less-restrictive way of protecting children from sexual material: content-filtering software, which the Supreme Court backed in a 2004 decision blocking the federal Child Online Protection Act. Additionally, they said the law regulates more speech than is necessary, since it applies to an entire website if more than one-third of its content is considered sexual material harmful to minors, and sweeps in material like romance novels and R-rated movies.",
      "For example, they said, \"a website that contains 65% core political speech and 35% sexually suggestive content would be 100% subject to H.B. 1181's restrictions. That is paradigmatic overinclusivity.\"",
      "But the law is also underinclusive since search engines and social media sites do not have to comply with age-verification requirements, even though minors can access the content there that Texas is trying to shield them from, the Free Speech Coalition argued.",
      "But conservative members of the court said the landscape has changed considerably since the court's 2004 decision and content-filtering has become less effective at keeping minors from accessing sexual material.",
      "\"We're in an entirely different world,\" Justice Clarence Thomas said.",
      "The Biden administration argued the law is subject to the most demanding form of judicial scrutiny and urged the Supreme Court to toss out the 5th Circuit's decision and send the case back to the appeals court to apply strict scrutiny.",
      "But in doing so, the Supreme Court should clarify that Congress and states can adopt appropriately tailored measures to keep children from accessing harmful sexual content online, Brian Fletcher, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices.",
      "Meanwhile, Texas Solicitor General Aaron Nielson, who argued for the state, said its age-verification requirement is \"simple\" and \"safe.\"",
      "He wrote in a filing that state officials were responding to a public health crisis sparked by kids' easy access to \"hardcore pornography\" through smartphones and other devices when they enacted the restriction.",
      "The age-veritification requirements, he said, \"protects children from that which is obscene by [adults'] standards, by requiring the purveyors to check whether their viewers are children \u2014 leaving adults able to access pornography by engaging in a process that they must complete potentially only once and that applies equally to viewing pornography, buying wine, or renting a car.\"",
      "Backing Texas in the dispute is a group of 24 states, officials from which are urging the Supreme Court to uphold the lower court's decision.",
      "The states wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief that age-verification laws are a routine exercise of their authority to protect children from being exposed to sexual violence and explicit images. They noted that most online pornography is not constitutionally protected, as it is considered obscene to minors and adults under a Supreme Court standard set in 1973.",
      "\"Texas's age-verification law effectuates the state's deeply important interest in protecting minors from the psychological, physical, and social harms wrought by the hardcore internet pornography petitioners purvey \u2014 an interest all agree is compelling, and that this court should hesitate to override,\" the states, led by the attorneys general of Ohio and Indiana, wrote.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June 2025.",

      "Washington \u2014 John Ratcliffe, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be CIA director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that if he's confirmed, the CIA would be rededicated to its intelligence-gathering mission.",
      "\"We will collect intelligence \u2014 especially human intelligence \u2014 in every corner of the globe, no matter how dark or difficult,\" Ratcliffe said during his confirmation hearing Wednesday. \"We will produce insightful, objective, all-source analysis, never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgment or infect our products.\"",
      "\"To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,\" Ratcliffe said. \"If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.\"",
      "He told the committee the U.S. faces \"what may be the most challenging national security environment in our nation's history,\" and these challenges \"increase the necessity of confirming a CIA director who is prepared on Day One to take them head-on.\"",
      "The two-hour hearing was one of about a\u00a0dozen hearings\u00a0scheduled for Trump's top administration picks this week ahead of his return to the White House next week. Though some of the president-elect's designated nominees have been subject to aggressive questioning and tense exchanges, the open portion of Ratcliffe's hearing remained notably civil. None of the Democrats on the committee expressed opposition to his formal nomination and Senate confirmation, though it's not yet clear how many Senate Democrats will vote to confirm him.",
      "Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman, served as director of national intelligence in the final months of President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At that time, Trump initially picked Ratcliffe to lead the nation's spy agencies earlier in his first term, but withdrew his name amid questions about his qualifications for the role. Months later, Trump again nominated Ratcliffe, and the Senate confirmed him as director of national intelligence without any support from Democrats.",
      "Ratcliffe said in his opening remarks Wednesday that \"for roughly a quarter of a century, I have devoted my professional life to U.S. national security.\" And he promised that if confirmed, he would focus on \"setting and communicating priorities and demanding relentless execution.\"",
      "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton kicked off the hearing by listing the ways in which the CIA must \"get back to its roots,\" adding that it \"must overcome several challenges to do so.\" He argued the CIA has become too bureaucratic, and its analysis and priorities have become politicized, among other obstacles.",
      "\"Mr. Ratcliffe, you have a big job ahead of you,\" Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, said. \"The nation needs a strong capable and aggressive CIA.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, agreed with Ratcliffe that the CIA faces an \"unprecedented number of challenges,\" and he mentioned the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, competition with China and the persistent threat of terrorism, which he said requires a \"great deal of leadership.\"",
      "Warner also outlined the importance of ensuring the intelligence community feels \"respected and valued,\" amid what he called \"underserved attacks\" by President-elect Donald Trump. He told Ratcliffe he has an opportunity at his confirmation hearing to \"reassure the men and women of the CIA that they not fear reprisal for being willing to speak truth to power.\"",
      "In Congress, Ratcliffe served on the House Intelligence Committee and House Judiciary Committee and was a staunch defender of Trump through his first impeachment and investigations into Russian election interference.",
      "In his\u00a0confirmation hearing\u00a0in 2020 to be DNI, Ratcliffe vowed to deliver \"objective and timely\" intelligence to senior policymakers and to ensure that it was \"collected, analyzed and reported without bias, prejudice or political influence.\" He also disagreed with Trump about whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election, but declined to take a stance on what Russia's desired outcome was.",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Ratcliffe faced a slew of questions about politicization of the CIA, pledging not to bow to political pressure from the administration or elsewhere or take action for political purposes.",
      "Ratcliffe also responded to questions about how he would resist efforts to force out career civil servants due to their perceived political views or loyalty to Trump, noting that during his time as director of national intelligence \"that never took place\" and is something he \"would never do.\"",
      "He vowed to work on the development of tools \"to go on offense\" against cyber adversaries, warning of the threat to the nation's digital borders \"from half a world away.\"",
      "The committee is proceeding with its questioning in a closed-door session. Cotton said the committee plans to vote on advancing Ratcliffe's nomination as soon as possible, as soon as Monday afternoon, after the inauguration.",
      "Ratcliffe's nomination",
      "Ratcliffe is considered to be a more traditional choice than some of Trump's picks for other roles, since he has served in a Senate-confirmed position once already and was also a member of Congress.",
      "As intelligence director, he was criticized by Democrats for declassifying in the final days of the 2020 presidential election Russian intelligence alleging damaging information about Democrats during the 2016 race even though he acknowledged it might not be true. But like top intelligence officials of Republican and Democratic administrations, he has also been warning for years of the threat posed by China to U.S. interests.",
      "China was among the topics at Wednesday's hearing, and in December 2020, Ratcliffe wrote that China \"poses the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War II.\" Ratcliffe, who was the nation's spy chief at the time, said he had shifted resources in the intelligence budget to make China more of a priority.",
      "\"Beijing is preparing for an open-ended period of confrontation with the U.S. Washington should also be prepared. Leaders must work across partisan divides to understand the threat, speak about it openly, and take action to address it,\" he wrote.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:02:58 -0500",
    "summary": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was hospitalized for two weeks at the start of 2024 for complications arising from surgery to treat prostate cancer.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon inspector general found in its review of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's hospitalization last year that it \"increased unnecessarily\" the risks to national security, even if ultimately, there were no immediate consequences.",
      "\"Although we found no adverse consequences to Defense Department operations arising from how the hospitalizations we reviewed were handled, the risks to our national defense, including the command and control of the Defense Department's critical national security operations, were increased unnecessarily,\" Inspector General Robert Storch said in a statement.",
      "Austin was hospitalized for two weeks at the start of 2024 for complications related to surgery to treat prostate cancer. The Pentagon faced sharp criticism for waiting several days to inform the White House that Austin was in the hospital \u2014 and at one point, in the intensive care unit.",
      "The review did not identify any adverse impacts on operational command and control or Defense Department functions but says, \"we believe that there was a potential for adverse effects.\"",
      "A senior defense official told reporters shortly after the report was released, that the review \"found that at no time, was there a break in command and control\" and \"at every moment, either the secretary of defense or the deputy secretary of defense was fully prepared to support the president as commander-in-chief.\"",
      "The report states that during the course of his hospitalization, Austin transferred authority of some of his duties to his deputy secretary of defense from Jan. 2 to 5, but neither of them notified Congress or the White House Situation Room in a \"timely manner\" as required.",
      "The report found that Austin did not consider transferring authorities while he was undergoing medical procedures on Jan. 6 and 8 that required moderate sedation. The inspector general found no evidence that Austin told the deputy secretary or his chief of staff he was undergoing the procedures. According to the review, Austin had texted his chief of staff that he did not want his medical condition to become \"a media circus.\"",
      "Austin told the inspector general investigators he told his doctors he would have to notify his superiors if he underwent general anesthesia. He signed forms acknowledging moderate sedation but said he needed to remain functional as \"that was the mandate \u2026 and I'm confident that that happened.\" He said that his doctors met his \"requirement to remain \u2026 functional.\"",
      "Nevertheless, the inspector general in its 20 recommendations said the Defense Department should further define what is \"medically incapacitated,\" and the phrase, \"unable to perform the functions and duties.\" Other recommendations include expanding the scope of who is required to report the hospitalization of secretaries of defense or senior Pentagon officials.",
      "The inspector general announced last year it would initiate a review to: \"examine the roles, processes, procedures, responsibilities, and actions related to the Secretary of Defense's hospitalization in December 2023 \u2013 January 2024, and assess whether the DoD's policies and procedures are sufficient to ensure timely and appropriate notifications and the effective transition of authorities as may be warranted due to health-based or other unavailability of senior leadership.\"",
      "The review found that Austin's intense privacy affected the course of events. It says that not only did Austin not tell his senior staff members of his medical condition or appointments, \"he specifically told one junior staff member 'if anyone had any questions they're more than welcome to ask [me] directly.'\"",
      "After he returned to work at the Pentagon following his hospitalization, Austin apologized for not telling President Biden or the public about when and why he had been hospitalized.",
      "\"We did not handle this right, and I did not handle this right,\" Austin said. \"I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public. And I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.\"",
      "The senior defense official said Austin \"apologized and he committed to improving transparency and processes moving forward, which the department has already done over the past year to ensure it doesn't happen again.\"",
      "CBS News obtained the audio of the 911 call that led to the hospitalization in which an aide asked the operator if the ambulance headed to Austin's residence could be discreet.",
      "\"Can I ask that, can the ambulance not show up with lights and sirens? We're trying to remain a little subtle,\" the caller is heard saying.",
      "A separate review by the Pentagon released last year concluded that there was no deliberate ill intent by Austin or his aides to keep the hospitalization secret but did acknowledge the policies for transferring the responsibilities of the secretary need to be improved.",
      "Austin told David Martin during a \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interview that he is now cancer-free.",
      "\"I thank God for that,\" Austin said.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:59:05 -0500",
    "summary": "In remarks to Congress, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Justice Department said that \"partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end\" under her watch.",
    "story": [
      "Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Justice, told the Senate Judiciary Committee\u00a0Wednesday that \"partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end,\" if she is confirmed as attorney general.",
      "\"America must have one tier of justice for all,\" the former Florida attorney general said.\u00a0 Her opening statement was earlier obtained exclusively by CBS News.",
      "The declaration comes as Democrats are expected to pepper the close ally of the president-elect with questions over whether she might weaponize the Justice Department to target Trump's political enemies, including President Biden and former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "The longtime prosecutor, who represented the president-elect during his first impeachment trial, says her \"overriding objective\" is to \"return the Department of Justice to its core mission,\" and vows to get the department \"back to basics \u2013 prosecuting violent crime and gang activity, stopping child predators and drug traffickers, protecting our nation from terrorists and other foreign threats, and addressing the overwhelming crisis at the Border.\"",
      "While seeking the job of the nation's highest ranking law enforcement officer, Bondi also plans to take aim at the Bureau of Prisons, promising to reduce recidivism and reform the federal agency long afflicted by understaffing, abuse, disrepair.",
      "\"We must fix the Bureau of Prisons and follow through on the promise of the First Step Act by building new halfway houses,\" Bondi said, referencing the president elect's hallmark criminal justice reform law. Signed by then-president Trump in 2018, it aims to reduce prison sentences and federal spending, but has been plagued by persistent implementation failures.",
      "\"The Bureau has suffered from years of mismanagement, lack of funding, and low morale. Federal corrections officers serve in challenging conditions on minimal pay and need more support. Our prison system can and will do better,\" Bondi told lawmakers Wednesday.",
      "Echoing the president-elect's promise of a \"new golden age,\" Bondi told lawmakers that Trump is \"unafraid to do things that have been deemed 'too difficult' and to reach across the aisle\" to address criminal justice reform.",
      "Trump selected Bondi to be his nominee for U.S. attorney general after his first pick, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration. Bondi formerly made history in 2010 when she became the first woman to serve as Florida's attorney general, and became an early advocate for Trump during his first bid for the White House in 2016.",
      "Harking on her early days as \"an intern at the Hillsborough County State Attorney's Office,\" Bondi spotlighted her 18 years of experience as a prosecutor and two terms as Florida attorney general, which she claims was defined by a fight to eliminate drug dealers in a state \"overwhelmed by pill mills and opioid deaths.\" While serving as Florida's top cop, Bondi established a prescription drug monitoring program which requires opioid-prescribing clinics to register with the state and have a physician-owner.",
      "\"On the civil side, we worked to protect consumers,\" Bondi said, touting her efforts to tackle \"overreach by big tech companies.\"",
      "If confirmed as attorney general, Bondi would inherit a slew of legal fights against the world's largest technology companies, including ongoing litigation with TikTok and the department's ongoing defense of a law that would force its parent company to sell the platform altogether.",
      "In the weeks leading up to her confirmation hearing, Bondi walked the halls of Capitol Hill, attending back-to-back meetings with senators. Unlike Trump's Gaetz, she is not expected to face significant hurdles to confirmation by the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Considered one of the less controversial choices for Trump's\u00a0new cabinet, Democrats are still likely to probe Bondi on her interpretation of the role of attorney general and commitment to the independence of the Justice Department.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who met with Bondi last week, accused Trump of using the Justice Department as his personal law firm, expressing concern that she might prioritize loyalty to Trump over the Constitution.",
      "\"The Department of Justice must also return to defending the foundational rights of all Americans, including free speech, free exercise of religion, and the right to bear arms,\" Bondi said, name-checking a campaign tagline of the president-elect. \"That is what the American people expect and deserve from the Department.\u00a0 If confirmed, I will do what it takes to make America safe again.\"",

      "\"Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States,\" he added. \"I have given my heart and my soul to our nation.

      "The White House has not released excerpts of the president's address.",
      "Mr. Biden has been on an informal farewell tour in recent days. He delivered his final foreign policy speech at the State Department Monday and a speech on his conservation legacy Tuesday. He's also expected to speak Thursday at a Pentagon commander-in-chief farewell ceremony.",
      "In his foreign policy speech, the president sought to make the case that America's position on the global stage and with its allies is stronger than it was when he took office four years ago. But now, the man he blamed for damaging key international relationships and threatening democracy is about to take office again.",
      "Mr. Biden remains the only presidential candidate to defeat Trump, but with the president-elect's defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden allies and other Democrats fear Trump will undo or undermine much of what they believe Mr. Biden has accomplished.",

      "The president also stood by his decision to withdraw the U.S. from Afghanistan, which brought an end to America's longest war, but cost the lives of 13 service members and dozens of Afghan civilians in a terrorist attack at the Hamid Karzai Airport in Kabul.",
      "The next administration will inherit its own set of challenges, Mr. Biden pointed out, including a growing relationship between Russia and North Korea, Russia's continued war on Ukraine, tensions in the South China Sea and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.",
      "The economy",
      "The Biden administration has argued the country is better off economically since he took office, pointing to his efforts to lower drug prices, the enactment of the bipartisan infrastructure law and unemployment levels that have remained low.",
      "The U.S. unemployment rate was 6.4% when Mr. Biden took office, with the economy still reeling from the global COVID pandemic. The president leaves office with an unemployment rate of 4.1% in December.",

    "summary": "The fast-moving legal battle over the release of special counsel Jack Smith's final report played out days before Trump's second-term inauguration.",
    "story": [
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland has submitted to Congress a portion of former special counsel Jack Smith's final report on his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump and released it to the public after a court order blocking its release expired at midnight Tuesday.",
      "Smith wrote in his report that his office began its prosecution of Trump because it had enough evidence against him, that \"[b]ut for Mr. Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.\"",
      "The report was sent to Congress, a source familiar with the matter confirmed, and made public shortly after following days of legal wrangling over whether it \u2014 or part of it \u2014 should be disclosed to the public. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon on Monday declined a request from Walt Nauta, an aide to Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, to block volume one of Smith's final report from becoming public.",
      "That portion pertains to Trump's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Volume two delves into allegations that Trump unlawfully held onto classified documents after the end of his first term in 2021 and obstructed the Justice Department's investigation.",
      "In a letter to Garland accompanying the report, Smith defended his decision to pursue charges against the president-elect and rejected Trump's accusations that his actions were influenced by the top ranks of the Justice Department.",
      "\"To all who know me well, the claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable,\" Smith wrote, adding later in the report his office had \"no interest in affecting the presidential election.\"",
      "Following the release of the section of the report on the 2020 election probe, the president-elect attacked the former special counsel on social media, calling him a \"a lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the Election, which I won in a landslide.\"",
      "\"To show you how desperate Deranged Jack Smith is, he released his Fake findings at 1:00 A.M. in the morning,\" Trump said early Tuesday.",
      "Smith used the first volume of his report to defend his work and investigative findings, alleging, \"The throughline of all of Mr. Trump's criminal efforts was deceit \u2014 knowingly false claims of election.\"",
      "Much of the 137-page volume recounts information that has already been made public through court filings during the course of the now-dismissed case against Trump filed in Washington, D.C. It also includes images of the violence that transpired at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump's supporters breached the building in an effort to stop Congress from reaffirming President Biden's win.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that the rioters who descended on the Capitol \"had been motivated and directed by Trump,\" a claim Trump has denied. The former special counsel wrote that his office was \"prepared\" to prove \"Trump willfully caused his supporters to obstruct and attempt to obstruct the proceeding by summoning them to Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Still, Smith wrote that his office \"did not develop direct evidence \u2014 such as an explicit admission or communication with co-conspirators \u2014 of Mr. Trump's subjective intent to cause the full scope of the violence that occurred on January 6.\"",
      "Now, four years since the Jan. 6 attack, more than 1,500 people have been charged as a result of their conduct at the Capitol. The former special counsel wrote that \"with that in mind, Mr. Trump's relative culpability weighed heavily in favor of charging him, as the individual most responsible for what occurred at the Capitol on January 6.\"",
      "Smith revealed that through voluntary interviews of more than 250 individuals and the grand-jury testimony of 55 people, his office was able to gather evidence that pointed to Trump's alleged crime, including allegations that he sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence into delaying the vote certification on Jan. 6, 2021, and he supported the organization of a false slate of electors.",
      "Pence sat for a grand-jury interview with prosecutors during the investigation, CBS News reported at the time.",
      "The former special counsel also detailed ways in which he alleged Trump sought to pressure the Justice Department at the time to investigate the false claims of fraud. At one point, according to the report, Trump allegedly told his acting attorney general to \"just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.\"",
      "A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Trump with four counts in the summer of 2023. He pleaded not guilty to all of the counts. But Smith wrote that his office considered \u2014 and ultimately decided against \u2014 bringing other charges. One potential charge was under the Insurrection Act, a Civil War-era law that bars those who incite an insurrection against the U.S. from holding federal office.",
      "But Smith said that while courts have described the Jan. 6 attack as an \"insurrection,\" his office was \"aware of the litigation risk that would be presented by employing this long-dormant statute.\"",
      "Trump was charged with allegedly participating in crimes with at least six unnamed co-conspirators, and Smith wrote that his office determined some shared criminal culpability with the president-elect. Smith said that after Trump was indicted in August 2023, his office continued to look into whether any of the other alleged participants should face charges. He said that he referred to a U.S. attorney's office for further investigation evidence that one individual may have committed unrelated crimes.",
      "Smith's office made a \"preliminary determination\" that admissible evidence could justify pursuing charges against some of Trump's co-conspirators and had started to look into how to proceed. But because his team did not reach a conclusion or seek any further indictments, Smith wrote that the report \"should not be read to allege that any particular person other than Mr. Trump committed a crime, nor should it be read to exonerate any particular person.\"",
      "Ahead of the report's release, Trump's defense attorneys asked Garland to remove Smith from his post and either decline to release the special counsel's report or hand the matter over to Trump's incoming administration, according to a letter released last week.",
      "The letter, addressed to Garland and a top career official at the Justice Department, alleged the special counsel did not have the legal authority to submit a final report summarizing his investigations into Trump and urged the attorney general to \"put an end to this weaponization of the justice system and move forward constructively.\"",
      "The correspondence was written in part by defense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emile Bove, Trump's picks to serve as deputy attorney general and principal deputy attorney general in his new administration.",
      "Trump has slammed Smith's investigation as politically motivated and denied all wrongdoing in the case.",
      "The legal battle over Smith's report on Trump",
      "The Justice Department's publication of the first volume of Smith's report marked the culmination of a fast-moving legal battle that transpired over the past week and played out days before Trump is to be sworn in for a second term. If the battle had continued until the president-elect's return to the White House on Jan. 20, it's not likely the special counsel's report would have been publicly released.",
      "Cannon, who was assigned to oversee the documents case, issued a temporary order last week that temporarily blocked the Justice Department from making the report public, after which a federal appeals court declined to stop its release. The district judge's order expired at 12 a.m. Tuesday.",
      "Garland has said he wouldn't publicly release the second part of the report because proceedings involving Nauta and de Oliveira are ongoing.",
      "Smith resigned his position as special counsel last Friday, and Justice Department prosecutors have taken over the ongoing matters arising from his investigations. Smith's two probes led to separate prosecutions of Trump, but they came to a close because of his victory in the November presidential election.",
      "As is required for special counsels, Smith drafted and submitted a final report to the attorney general last week. Garland has vowed to make public all special counsel reports completed while he is attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into Mr. Biden's handling of classified documents. He released the special counsel's final report on the investigation into Hunter Biden's tax evasion and gun possession cases Monday night.",
      "Last week, Garland informed Congress that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. It's unclear whether the second volume, related to the classified documents case, will ever be disclosed to the American people.",
      "Smith's tenure as special counsel began in November 2022, when Garland tapped him to take over the ongoing investigations involving Trump. The president-elect repeatedly vowed to fire the special counsel when he returned to the White House.",
      "Federal grand juries returned two indictments against the president-elect, marking the first time a former president was accused of federal crimes. In the 2020 election case, brought in Washington, D.C., Trump faced four charges, including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. In the documents case, the president-elect was charged with 40 counts, including willfully retaining national defense information and conspiracy to obstruct justice.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and accused Smith of mounting a politically charged investigation against him because he was Mr. Biden's political rival.",
      "The 2020 election case landed before the Supreme Court with Trump's claim he was entitled to presidential immunity that shielded him from prosecution, since the conduct that gave rise to the charges occurred during his first term in office.",
      "In July, the high court issued a landmark ruling finding that former presidents cannot face charges for official acts, but were not immune from prosecution for unofficial actions. The decision led to further proceedings before the federal district court overseeing the case.",
      "But the charges were dismissed in November following Trump's election to a second term, as longstanding Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",

With the arrival of new Chief Justice Cory Swanson, who ran as a judicial conservative for the nonpartisan seat and was sworn in Jan. 6, the court now leans more conservative than before the election.",
      "A similar dynamic is at play elsewhere. Abortion rights supporters prevailed on ballot measures in seven of the 10 states where abortion was up for a vote in November. But even with new voter-approved constitutional protections, courts will have to untangle a web of existing state laws on abortion and square them with any new ones legislators approve. The new makeup of supreme courts in several states indicates that the results of the legal fights to come aren't clear-cut.",
      "Activists have been working to reshape high courts, which in recent years have become the final arbiters of a patchwork of laws regulating abortions. That's because the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned federal abortion protections, leaving rulemaking to the states.",
      "How abortion is affecting state supreme court races",
      "Since then, the politics of state supreme court elections have been \"supercharged\" as fights around abortion shifted to states' top courts, according to Douglas Keith, a senior counsel at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "\"Because we're human, you can't scrub these races of any political connotations at all,\" said former Montana Supreme Court Justice Jim Nelson. \"But it's getting worse.\"",
      "The wave of abortion litigation in state courts has spawned some of the most expensive state supreme court races in history, including more than $42 million spent on the nonpartisan 2023 Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, where abortion access was among the issues facing the court. Janet Protasiewicz won the seat, flipping the balance of the court to a liberal majority.",
      "In many states, judicial elections are nonpartisan but political parties and ideological groups still lobby for candidates. In 2024, abortion surfaced as a top issue in these races.",
      "In Michigan, spending by non-candidate groups alone topped $7.6 million for the two open seats on the state Supreme Court. The Michigan races are officially labeled as nonpartisan, although candidates are nominated by political parties.",
      "An ad for the two candidates backed by Democrats cautioned that \"the Michigan state Supreme Court can still take abortion rights away\" even after voters added abortion protections to the state constitution in 2022. The ad continued, \"Kyra Harris Bolden and Kimberly Thomas are the only Supreme Court candidates who will protect access to abortion.\" Both won their races.",
      "Abortion opponent Kelsey Pritchard, director of state public affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, decried the influence of abortion politics on state court elections. \"Pro-abortion activists know they cannot win through the legislatures, so they have turned to state courts to override state laws,\" Pritchard said.",
      "Some abortion opponents now support changes to the way state supreme courts are selected.",
      "In Missouri, where voters passed a constitutional amendment in November to protect abortion access, the new leader of the state Senate, Cindy O'Laughlin, a Republican, has proposed switching to nonpartisan elections from the state's current model, in which the governor appoints a judge from a list of three finalists selected by a nonpartisan commission. Although Republicans have held the governor's mansion since 2017, she pointed to the Missouri Supreme Court's 4-3 ruling in September that allowed the abortion amendment to remain on the ballot and said courts \"have undermined legislative efforts to protect life.\"",
      "In a case widely expected to reach the Missouri Supreme Court, the state's Planned Parenthood clinics are trying to use the passage of the new amendment to strike down Missouri's abortion restrictions, including a near-total ban. O'Laughlin said her proposal, which would need approval from the legislature and voters, was unlikely to influence that current litigation but would affect future cases.",
      "\"A judiciary accountable to the people would provide a fairer venue for addressing legal challenges to pro-life laws,\" she said.",
      "A push for partisan elections for state judges",
      "Nonpartisan judicial elections can buck broader electoral trends. In Michigan, for example, voters elected both Supreme Court candidates nominated by Democrats last year even as Donald Trump won the state and Republicans regained control of the state House.",
      "In Kentucky's nonpartisan race, Judge Pamela Goodwine, who was endorsed by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, outperformed her opponent even in counties that went for Trump, who won the state. She'll be serving on the bench as a woman's challenge to the state's two abortion bans makes its way through state courts.",
      "Partisan judicial elections, however, tend to track with other partisan election results, according to Keith of the Brennan Center. So some state legislatures have sought to turn nonpartisan state supreme court elections into fully partisan affairs.",
      "In Ohio, Republicans have won every state Supreme Court seat since lawmakers passed a bill in 2021 requiring party affiliation to appear on the ballot for those races. That includes three seats up for grabs in November that solidified the Republican majority on the court from 4-3 to 6-1.",
      "\"These justices who got elected in 2024 have been pretty open about being anti-abortion,\" said Jessie Hill, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, who has been litigating a challenge to Ohio's abortion restrictions since voters added protections to the state constitution in 2023.",
      "Until the recent ballot measure vote in Montana, the only obstacle blocking Republican-passed abortion restrictions from taking effect had been a nearly 26-year-old decision that determined Montana's right to privacy extends to abortion.",
      "Nelson, the former justice who was the lead author of the decision, said the court has since gradually leaned more conservative. He noted the state's other incoming justice, Katherine Bidegaray, was backed by abortion rights advocates.",
      "\"The dynamic of the court is going to change,\" Nelson said after the election. \"But the chief justice has one vote, just like everybody else.\"",
      "Swanson, Montana's new chief justice, had said throughout his campaign that he'll make decisions case by case. He also rebuked his opponent, Jerry Lynch, for saying he'd respect the court's ruling that protected abortion. Swanson called such statements a signal to liberal groups.",
      "At least eight cases are pending in Montana courts challenging state laws to restrict abortion access. Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, said that the new constitutional language, which takes effect in July, could further strengthen those cases but that the court's election outcome leaves room for uncertainty.",
      "The state's two outgoing justices had past ties to the Democratic Party. Fuller said they also consistently supported abortion as a right to privacy. \"One of those folks is replaced by somebody who we don't know will uphold that,\" she said. \"There will be this period where we're trying to see where the different justices fall on these issues.\"",
      "Those cases likely won't end the abortion debate in Montana.",
      "As of the legislative session's start in early January, Republican lawmakers, who have for years called the state Supreme Court liberal, had already proposed eight bills regarding abortion and dozens of others aimed at reshaping judicial power. Among them is a bill to make judicial elections partisan.",
      "Montana Sen. Daniel Emrich, a Republican who requested a bill titled \"Prohibit dismembering of person and provide definition of human,\" said it's too early to know which restrictions anti-abortion lawmakers will push hardest.",

      "In the report, which Garland submitted to Congress on Monday, Weiss wrote that he stood by his decisions to prosecute the president's son on tax and gun charges after agreements with Hunter's legal team collapsed. And Weiss pushed back on Mr. Biden's criticism of the probe.",
      "Weiss led a yearslong investigation into Hunter Biden that ultimately led to a jury conviction on felony gun charges in Delaware federal court and a guilty plea to tax evasion charges in California. In December, the president pardoned his son and claimed the charges against Hunter Biden were \"raw politics,\" a comment that was met with bipartisan criticism.",
      "\"The President's statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith,\" Weiss wrote in his report. \"The President's characterizations are incorrect based on the facts in this case, and, on a more fundamental level, they are wrong.\"",
      "\"Calling those rulings into question and injecting partisanship into the independent administration of the law undermines the very foundation of what makes America's justice system fair and equitable,\" Weiss wrote. \"It erodes public confidence in an institution that is essential to preserving the rule of law.\"",
      "In the report, Weiss defended his charging decisions, which many Republicans in Congress alleged favored the president's son.",
      "\"I concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution were satisfied as to both the tax offenses and the gun offenses,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "In 2023, Hunter Biden was charged with lying on a gun application about his drug use and in a separate case, he faced three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanor offenses, including failure to file and pay his taxes, tax evasion and filing a false return.",
      "Prosecutors alleged he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes while living an \"extravagant lifestyle.\"",
      "\"Not only were both cases proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but they resulted in a verdict lawfully rendered by a jury and an admission of guilt. In making my decisions, I remained impervious to political influence at all times,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "During the special counsel's probe, IRS agents who worked on the Hunter Biden tax case with Weiss' team came forward in an interview with CBS News to raise questions about what they alleged was special treatment in the probe of the president's son. The said that dating back to the Trump administration, they had repeatedly been prevented from taking steps in the IRS investigation that would have been considered routine in other cases.",
      "\"We have to make sure as a special agent for IRS Criminal Investigation that we treat every single person exactly the same,\" Gary Shapley, a 14-year veteran of the agency, told CBS News at the time. \"And that just simply didn't happen here.\"",
      "The Justice Department and Weiss denied that Hunter Biden received favorable treatment.",
      "In a letter to Garland included in the report, Hunter Biden's legal team pointed out its criticism of the probe and told the attorney general, \"you likely are aware of the arguments we have made about the initiation and conduct of the prosecutions against our client.\"",
      "\"These are not 'inconsequential' or 'technical' tax code violations,\" Weiss wrote. \"The prosecution of Mr. Biden was warranted given the nature and seriousness of his tax crimes.\"",
      "Answering criticism of the gun charges, Weiss argued, \"An analysis of Justice Department data from 2008 to 2017 shows that these charges are brought more frequently than over 90 percent of the other available firearm offenses.\"",
      "According to Garland's letter to Congress, Weiss submitted the report a few days ago, on Friday. The attorney general noted there had been no instances during the probe when Garland had to intervene because of policy violations.",

    "story": [
      "In a roughly 30-minute phone call Sunday afternoon, President Biden delivered difficult news to the families of three Americans held by the Taliban. He did not have a deal with the Taliban to free their loved ones from captivity, despite what U.S. officials described to CBS News as a significant offer the U.S. had extended in Doha days earlier. The U.S. considers Ryan Corbett and George Glezmann to be wrongfully detained by the Taliban, and describes Mahmood Habibi, who holds dual American and Afghan citizenship, as \"unjustly held\" since 2022.",
      "Ahmad Shah Habibi, the brother of Mahmood Habibi, told CBS News that during the conversation, Mr. Biden clarified that he would not agree to the Taliban's demand that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al Afghani, a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, unless the Taliban, now the government of Afghanistan, also releases Mahmood. An NSC spokesman declined to respond to a CBS inquiry about that specific claim.",
      "Mahmood Habibi disappeared in Afghanistan in 2022, and the Taliban denied abducting him. In a public notice posted by the FBI in August 2024, the agency said it \"believed\" that Habibi was taken by Taliban military or security forces and \"has not been heard from since his disappearance.\" The FBI said in its notice that Habibi was working as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecom company when he disappeared.",
      "The Taliban still say they do not have Habibi in custody.",
      "\"No, we don't have him,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News Monday.",
      "Asked whether Mahmoud had disappeared in Afghanistan, Mujahid said, \"It's not clear either, because we didn't know him before.\"",
      "Ahmad Habibi told CBS News, \"My family has every confidence that my brother is alive. There are things that neither we nor the U.S. government can say publicly, but Mahmood's case is different from the other two Americans.\"",
      "\"We know the other families are desperate to get their loved ones home and I told the president we want them home, too,\" Ahmad Habibi added. \"But anyone speculating that my brother is dead is just feeding into Taliban claims. We are grateful that President Biden committed to not leave Mahmood behind,\" and he said that national security adviser Jake Sullivan had also made similar assurances.",

      "Corbett, who is fluent in Pashto, was working for local nongovernmental organizations before starting a microloan and consulting business in Kabul when he was arrested with three associates \u2014 one German and two Afghans \u2014 during a business trip to northern Afghanistan in 2022.",

      "\"He was very kind and empathetic, but what I heard him say is he's not bringing Ryan home, and that was just devastating,\" Anna Corbett said. She blasted Mr. Biden for refusing to agree to the Taliban's terms for a deal. \"It is not being taken and it is incredibly crushing to our family.\"",
      "She has launched a public campaign in recent days to urge the incoming administration to press for her husband's release, and she traveled to President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago residence in hopes of making an in-person plea to Trump. Neither Mr. Biden nor Trump have met with her yet.",
      "Anna Corbett did tell Fox News that Trump sent incoming national security adviser and current Florida Rep. Mike Waltz to meet with her. She said he spent more than an hour listening to her family's story. She expressed frustration that it took more than a year to get a similar meeting with the current national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.",
      "The Taliban have been demanding that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, who is being held in indefinite law-of-war detention at Guantanamo Bay. A source familiar with his case said the U.S. intelligence community and Pentagon oppose Rahim's release and could not guarantee that he no longer represented a threat to the U.S. However, the president could waive that if he determined it were in the U.S. interest to finalize a prisoner swap.",
      "Rahim was captured in Pakistan in 2007 by the CIA and was the last detainee sent to the Guantanamo prison facility by the Bush administration in 2008. He has never been charged with war crimes, but the periodic review board has deemed his continued detention a national security necessity. His 2016 intelligence profile describes him as a courier for al Qaeda.",
      "In its statement acknowledging the phone call, the White House also noted that Mr. Biden had been able to bring home U.S. citizens who had been detained before the U.S. exit from Afghanistan in 2021. Corbett, Glezmann and Habibi were detained after traveling to Afghanistan following the Taliban's return to power. That ascendance of the Taliban followed a diplomatic deal negotiated by the Trump administration for U.S. troops to withdraw and a surprisingly strong Taliban military offensive that caught the Biden administration off guard, leading to a hasty and chaotic U.S. evacuation. Unwilling to remain without U.S. troops, NATO forces also pulled out.",
      "The U.S. does not officially recognize the Taliban, with its horrific human rights record, as the legitimate government of Afghanistan but has been in contact with its leaders through U.S. agencies as well as via the Qatari government. Last weekend in Doha, Special Presidential Envoy Roger Carstens and NSC official Jen Daskal pressed for a deal with the Taliban to free the Americans.",

      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built, generating a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff using 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. The New Glenn rocket, built by Bezos' space company Blue Origin, is not nearly as powerful, but it will compete head-to-head with SpaceX's industry-dominating Falcon 9-family rockets.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 20:01:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dropping hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant in a desperate effort to stop the flames.",
    "story": [
      "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dousing the area with more than water: Hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant have been dropped ahead of the flames in a desperate effort to stop them before they destroy more neighborhoods.",
      "The deadly fires have displaced thousands of residents and destroyed more than 12,000 structures since they began last Tuesday, Jan. 7. Four major fires driven by strong Santa Ana winds have charred about 62 square miles, according to Cal Fire.",
      "Fire agencies say the suppressants \u2014 most often used to fight forest fires \u2014 are an invaluable tool. But what is in them and are they safe?",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "When are fire suppressants used?",
      "The fires are burning quickly through canyons and other rugged areas that are difficult for firefighters on the ground to reach, Cal Fire said.",
      "While fire suppressants can be very effective, they do have limitations, the agency said. Strong winds can make it too dangerous to fly at the low altitudes needed for drops and can dissipate the retardant before it hits the ground.",
      "Besides Cal Fire, multiple agencies have dropped fire retardant and water, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Los Angeles and Ventura county fire departments, the city and the National Guard.",
      "What is in aerial fire suppressants?",
      "Aerial fire suppressants are generally a mixture of water, ammonium phosphate \u2014 essentially fertilizer \u2014 and iron oxide, which is added to make the retardant visible, said Daniel McCurry, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Southern California.",
      "The Forest Service, which has used 13 aircraft to dump suppressants on the Los Angeles fires, says they help starve a fire of oxygen and slow the rate of burn by cooling and coating vegetation and other surfaces.",
      "Perimeter, the company that supplies fire retardant to the Forest Service and other agencies, says the phosphate changes the way cellulose in plants decomposes and makes them non-flammable.",
      "The fire suppressants are generally considered safe for people, but many worry about their potential effects on wildlife.",
      "The Forest Service bans use of aerial suppressants over waterways and endangered species habitats, \"except when human life or public safety are threatened,\" due to potential health effects on fish and other wildlife.",
      "McCurry, from USC, said he and other researchers tested several suppressants and found heavy metals, including chromium and cadmium, in one commonly used by the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "McCurry said the study's findings suggest that it's \"plausible\" that fire suppressants could contribute to spikes of chromium and other heavy metals in waterways downstream of wildfires.",
      "\"We don't quite have a smoking gun yet because it's difficult, although not impossible, to prove where a heavy metal came from,\" McCurry said. \"We're working on that.\"",
      "Perimeter, the manufacturer of the Forest Service's fire retardant, said McCurry's research was on a formulation that wasn't used in California and is no longer used by the Forest Service. The company also says it doesn't add metals, which it says are naturally present in all ammonium phosphate fertilizers, and that its aerial suppressants \"are exhaustively tested by the USDA Forest Service and meet or exceed all health and safety standards.\"",
      "Using flame retardants to protect the power grid",
      "Several Los Angeles area power companies are also using flame retardants to try to help protect power poles and lines, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "Crews have been working for days, stopping at as many power poles as possible along the edges of the wildfires \u2014the Palisades Fire along the Los Angeles coast and the Eaton Fire in the mountains above Pasadena and Altadena.",
      "First, they clear dry shrubbery from the area surrounding the poles, then they use their trucks to douse each power pole with fire retardant \u2014 the same substance that's dropped by firefighting aircraft from above. They try to spray it as far up the pole as possible and into all the cracks, so embers can't get a foothold.",
      "\"That way, if or when the fire does make it this way, we don't have to worry about embers catching it,\" said Connor Norton, one of the PG&E employees working in North Hollywood on Sunday.",
      "\"The best way to save lives\"",
      "The use of fire retardants is imperative to putting out wildfires that expose millions of people to health risks, including from a toxic mix of microscopic particles that can cause breathing and heart problems by penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream.",
      "Studies have shown that wildfire smoke accounted for up to half of all health-damaging particle air pollution in the western U.S. in recent years as warming temperatures fueled more destructive blazes.",
      "And research released last year by the Alzheimer's Association found that wildfire smoke may be worse for brain health than other types of air pollution, raising the risk of dementia.",
      "\"The use of wildland fire retardant is the best way to save lives, protect communities and keep fires small,\" said Edward Goldberg, vice chairman of solutions at Perimeter.",
      "McCurry, the USC researcher, said more study is needed on fire suppressants \u2014 including in Los Angeles once the fires are out \u2014 but he understands their value: \"If there was a brush fire coming for my house, I'd still rather than paint a lot of (fire retardant) in front of it.\"",

      "Though it's not known exactly when they will show up in 2025, they typically appear in May and last through June. During those weeks, the cicadas mature, mate and lay eggs before dying off, and then their offspring begin the cycle anew.",
      "Climate change is also affecting the timing of the insects' arrival. Last year, the cicadas' return started in Georgia nearly two weeks ahead of schedule.",
      "Where will Brood XIV cicadas emerge?",
      "Known as the \"Great(er) Eastern Brood,\" this group is historically found in areas of north Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, southern Indiana and Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts.",
      "However, UConn researchers note that Brood XIV cicadas population are declining on Long Island and their distributions are shifting in southwestern Ohio and southeastern Indiana. The researchers said they will map and study the cicadas' 2025 emergence to address gaps in knowledge about the patterns.",

    "story": [
      "After launching more than 100 small payloads from California on Tuesday and two commercial moon landers from Florida early Wednesday, both atop Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship for a ground-shaking launch from the Texas Gulf Coast to kick off the program's seventh test flight.",
      "But bad weather prompted the California rocket builder to delay the high-profile flight to Thursday, when it will follow a NASA spacewalk outside the International Space Station and the launch of Jeff Bezos' New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight.",
      "The New Glenn is scheduled for its own weather-delayed liftoff from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1 a.m. EST, the opening of a three-hour launch window.",
      "Six hours later, space station astronauts Nick Hague and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams plan to venture outside the NASA lab complex for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk starting around 8 a.m. to carry out a variety of maintenance and upgrade tasks.",
      "That will set the stage for the Super Heavy-Starship launch from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility at 5 p.m. EST, weather permitting.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built, generating a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff using 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. The New Glenn rocket, built by Bezos' space company Blue Origin, is not nearly as powerful, but it will compete head-to-head with SpaceX's industry-dominating Falcon 9-family rockets.",
      "Like the Falcon 9's first stage, the New Glenn booster is reusable, and Blue Origin will attempt to recover its first stage with touchdown on an offshore landing ship.

    "story": [
      "With the nearly full moon shining overhead, two companies, one American and the other headquartered in Japan, launched privately developed robotic lunar landers early Wednesday, sharing a sky-lighting ride to space atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "The U.S. lander, built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace and known as \"Blue Ghost,\" is carrying 10 sophisticated instruments for NASA while the Japanese spacecraft, built by Tokyo-based ispace and known as \"Resilience,\" is carrying four instruments of its own and a small microrover known as \"Tenacious.\"",
      "Mounted one atop the other in the nose cone of the Falcon 9, liftoff from historic pad 39A came on time at 1:11 a.m. EST Wednesday. Blue Ghost, weighing 1,033 pounds without propellant, was released to fly on its own one hour and five minutes after liftoff.",
      "Resilience, which weighs about 750 pounds, was deployed 21 minutes later, after the Falcon 9 carried out a final second stage engine firing to put the craft on a different trajectory.",
      "\"Our customers have different strategies for arriving to the moon, and Falcon 9's abilities enable us to deliver each lander to their respective injection orbits to complete their missions,\" said Julianna Scheiman, a senior SpaceX manager.",
      "The landers are taking very different routes to the moon. Blue Ghost is expected to spend about 25 days in Earth orbit, giving Firefly engineers time to thoroughly check out the craft's instruments, propulsion and other subsystems. The craft then will fire its engines for a four-day trip to the moon, followed by 16 days in lunar orbit.",
      "If no major problems develop, Blue Ghost, 6.6 feet tall and 11.5 feet wide, then will descend to the surface near the center of Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 touching down on four shock-absorbing legs. Its 10 science instruments will have two full weeks, or a lunar \"day,\" to collect data.",
      "\"The research we gather will help unlock future space exploration, while also benefiting life on Earth, with new insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect our planet,\" said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",
      "\"Each milestone we complete will provide valuable data for future missions and ultimately keep the United States and our international partners at the forefront of space exploration.\"",
      "Unlike Blue Ghost, ispace's Resilience, also known as Hakuto-R, will head for the moon about two days after launch, using a low-energy fuel-saving trajectory. One month later, the craft will fly past the moon, using its gravity to adjust the flight path before entering orbit about four months after launch. Two weeks after that, Resilience will attempt its own landing at Mare Frigoris, the Sea of Cold.",
      "ispace launched its first Hakuto lander in late 2022, but flight controllers lost contact the following March as the spacecraft was nearing the moon's surface.",
      "Investigators later determined the onboard software misinterpreted the lander's altitude after flying over the rim of a crater. The vehicle subsequently ran out of propellant and crashed to the surface.",
      "That problem has been corrected, ispace says, prompting the company to name its second Hakuto lander \"Resilience.\" ispace officials are optimistic about its chances the second time around.",
      "\"We've got experiments that I think are going to help with the establishment of lunar infrastructure that will eventually, hopefully lead to a permanent, significant human presence on the moon,\" said Ron Garan, a former space shuttle astronaut and CEO of ispace USA.",
      "\"We're doing an electrolysis experiment. We're doing a food production experiment. We also have some art installations.\"",
      "A model of a Swedish house will be carried away from the lander on the rover, which will \"set it down on the lunar surface,\" Garan said. \"We're going to photograph it, and it's a really exciting artistic endeavor as well.\"",
      "Garan called the microrover, built by ispace's Luxembourg-based unit and measuring just 10.2 inches tall and 21.6 inches long, \"really critical to the future of our company.\"",
      "\"The data that's going to come off the rover is going to be really valuable to us as we continue to hone our design on the surface mobility aspect of the business,\" he said. \"And so, that's really exciting, too.\"",
      "The Resilience mission is privately funded, without any financing from NASA. The instruments aboard Blue Ghost, in contrast, cost NASA $44 million to develop. The agency agreed to pay Firefly $101 million to carry them to the moon as part of its\u00a0Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's science mission directorate.",
      "\"To date, five vendors have been awarded 11 lunar deliveries under CLPS and are sending more than 50 instruments to various locations on the moon, including the lunar South Pole. Existing CLPS contracts (have) a cumulative maximum contract value of $2.6 billion through 2028. No other nation has done this.\"",
      "The Blue Ghost instruments will collect data on the lunar dust environment, drill into the soil below the lander, monitor background X-ray emissions, test whether Earth-orbiting navigation satellites can be used near the moon and the effectiveness of computer radiation shielding, among other topics of interest.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Fox.",
      "\"The technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost mission will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments and most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Kim said the Blue Ghost mission will span about two months.",
      "\"After Blue Ghost lands on the moon, we'll be collecting critical payload science data throughout the entire mission,\" he said. \"We'll then wrap up the mission by capturing a solar eclipse and a lunar sunset in high definition video before operating several hours into the lunar night.\"",
      "Toward the end of the mission, the company hopes to capture a phenomenon first seen by NASA's Surveyor moon landers and at least two Apollo crews, a so-called \"horizon glow\" caused by sunlight interacting with small dust particles kicked up by solar radiation and micrometeoroid impacts.",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0later this month if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "Specifically, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok. If ByteDance had started the process to sell TikTok, the president also could push pause on adoption of the law for 90 days.",
      "On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Elon Musk could buy TikTok's U.S. operations, effectively allowing the app to evade a ban. Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to ever sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "The Supreme Court on Jan. 11 heard arguments from government attorneys, who say TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security, and from lawyers for the social media platform. Experts said the justices seemed receptive to the government's case, increasing the likelihood of a ban. Here's what that would mean for TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:00:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",
      "\"I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas,\" Trump said. \"That's why we have them.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 12:41:49 -0500",
    "summary": "Meta shocked the tech world this week by moving to overhaul its approach to fact checking. Here's what the changes mean for social media users.",
    "story": [
      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",
      "More information on how X's Community Notes works can be found on X's Community Notes page.",
      "CBS News has a dedicated editorial team,\u00a0CBS News Confirmed, that fact-checks claims, exposes misinformation and provides critical context. You can follow CBS News Confirmed on\u00a0Instagram\u00a0and\u00a0TikTok.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 09:15:00 -0500",

      "Find updates from the TikTok Supreme Court arguments here.",
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney general, vowed to end the \"weaponization\" of the Justice Department at her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, saying her focus will be on reducing crime and upholding the law.",
      "The former Florida attorney general, who represented Trump during his first impeachment, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday to testify about her nomination, which is all but certain to be approved in the GOP-controlled Senate.",
      "She spent much of the hearing seeking to allay concerns from skeptical Democrats that Trump would use the Justice Department to target his political enemies once in office.",
      "\"There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,\" Bondi said, adding that she believes prosecutors under President Biden unfairly targeted Trump for the last four years.",
      "\"I will fight every day to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,\" she said. \"The partisanship, the weaponization, will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.\"",
      "Democrats did not seem convinced, repeatedly pressing Bondi on whether she'd investigate and prosecute figures ranging from former Rep. Liz Cheney and former special counsel Jack Smith to journalists and Trump critics.",
      "Bondi's confirmation hearing",
      "Trump selected Bondi to be his nominee for U.S. attorney general after his first pick, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration. Bondi made history in 2010 when she became the first woman to serve as Florida's attorney general, a role she held for two terms.",
      "\"If confirmed as the next attorney general of the United States, my overriding objective will be to return the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe and vigorously prosecuting criminals,\" Bondi said in her opening statement.",
      "Bondi said her time as a local prosecutor framed her goals for the Justice Department, which she described as \"getting back to the basics\" of combating crime and reducing recidivism.",
      "Republicans on the committee largely focused on Bondi's decades of crimefighting experience as a local prosecutor, and later as Florida attorney general. They claimed the Justice Department has been \"weaponized\" in recent years for political reasons, pointing to the prosecutions of Trump that have been dropped since the election.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the committee's top Democrat, noted Bondi's experience, but said it is Trump who has vowed to use the Justice Department to target his political enemies. Durbin said he wants assurances that Bondi would keep the Justice Department independent, and would be willing to say \"no\" to Trump. Trump clashed with his two attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and William Barr, over decisions they made in his first term.",
      "Durbin asked Bondi if she accepted that Trump lost the election in 2020, a fact that he and many of his prominent supporters have not publicly acknowledged. Bondi stopped short of doing so Wednesday.",
      "\"There was a peaceful transition of power. President Trump left office and was overwhelmingly elected in 2024,\" Bondi said. Bondi told Durbin that she \"accept[s] the results\" of the 2020 election but declined to say outright that Mr. Biden won.",
      "Durbin asked if Bondi would support pardons for people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Bondi said, if asked, she would review potential pardons on a \"case by case basis,\" adding: \"I condemn any violence on a law enforcement officer in this country.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, asked Bondi if she would \"be willing to resign if ordered to do something improper.\"",
      "\"Senator, I wouldn't work at a law firm, I wouldn't be a prosecutor, I wouldn't be attorney general if anyone asked me to do something improper and I felt I had to carry that out, of course I would not do that,\" Bondi said. \"That's one of the main things you learn as a young prosecutor, is to do the right thing.\"",
      "Later, she told Coons she and the president-elect have not discussed appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Mr. Biden \u2014 a threat Trump has made. Throughout the hearing, she argued she would keep the Justice Department independent from the White House, including by upholding a department policy limiting contacts with White House officials.",
      "Bondi was repeatedly pressed by Democrats about whether she would target perceived Trump foes, including Cheney and Smith, who led the dual federal investigations against Trump. During one particularly heated exchange, she declined to say if she knew of any factual predicate for investigating Cheney, and told California Sen. Adam Schiff his concerns are misplaced.",
      "\"You're all so worried about Liz Cheney, senator, you know what we should be worried about? The crime rate in California right now is through the roof,\" she said.",
      "Bondi was also asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, about the reauthorization of Section 702, a government intelligence collection tool that has come under fire from some Republicans in Congress. She said she would take a look at the issue and called Section 702 a \"very important tool.\"",
      "Bondi's nomination",
      "Bondi's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee was one of several taking place before GOP-led panels this week as Trump prepares to begin his second term in office. Republicans have indicated they plan to give substantial deference to Trump as he fills out the top ranks of his administration and are aiming to install key Cabinet officials to their posts soon after the president-elect is inaugurated Monday.",
      "Bondi spent the weeks leading up to her confirmation hearing meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, and she is not expected to face significant hurdles in the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Durbin accused Trump of using the Justice Department as his personal law firm and said he was concerned Bondi will prioritize fealty to Trump over loyalty to the Constitution. He met with Bondi last week.",
      "Bondi was term-limited in her position as Florida's attorney general and left office in 2019. While in office, she spearheaded lawsuits against the Obama administration, challenging the Affordable Care Act \u2014 known as Obamacare \u2014 and then-President Barack Obama's immigration policies.",
      "She went on to serve as an attorney and lobbyist at the firm Ballard Partners. There, she represented large corporations like General Motors, Amazon, Uber and the American Institute Against Human Trafficking, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit that tracks lobbying. And she submitted a registration with the federal government to lobby on behalf of Qatar \"regarding Qatari relations with U.S. government officials, U.S. business entities, and non-governmental audiences, in dealing with matters pertaining to combating human trafficking.\"",
      "At her hearing on Wednesday, Bondi said she was \"very proud of the work that I did\" with Qatar, telling Durbin her work was focused on \"anti-human trafficking efforts related to the World Cup.\"",
      "\"I was registered as FARA along with many members of my firm. That was the sole portion of my representation for Qatar,\" she said, referencing a federal law that requires lobbyists who work for foreign countries to register with the government.",
      "During Trump's first term, Bondi briefly left her lobbying position to serve as a member of his defense team during the first set of impeachment proceedings pursued by congressional Democrats. She defended Trump's July 2019 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, in which Trump pressured Zelenskyy to investigate Mr. Biden.",
      "The Democratic-led House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstructing a congressional investigation, making him just the third U.S. president to ever be impeached. The Republican-led Senate then acquitted him following a trial, where Bondi was part of the team representing Trump.",
      "In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, Bondi spearheaded legal efforts to challenge the results in Pennsylvania and pushed the false claim that Trump won the state. She was asked about that work in Wednesday's hearing.",
      "\"I was an advocate for the campaign, and I was on the ground in Pennsylvania and I saw many things there. But do I accept the results? Of course I do. Do I agree with what happened?\" Bondi said. \"No one from either side of the aisle should want there to be any issues with election integrity in our country. We should all want our elections to be free and fair, and the rules and the law to be followed.\"",

    "summary": "Trump's pick to be CIA director promised in his confirmation hearing to hone in on setting strong intelligence collection priorities and \"demanding relentless execution.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 John Ratcliffe, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be CIA director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that if he's confirmed, the CIA would be rededicated to its intelligence-gathering mission.",
      "\"We will collect intelligence \u2014 especially human intelligence \u2014 in every corner of the globe, no matter how dark or difficult,\" Ratcliffe said during his confirmation hearing Wednesday. \"We will produce insightful, objective, all-source analysis, never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgment or infect our products.\"",
      "\"To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,\" Ratcliffe said. \"If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.\"",
      "He told the committee the U.S. faces \"what may be the most challenging national security environment in our nation's history,\" and these challenges \"increase the necessity of confirming a CIA director who is prepared on Day One to take them head-on.\"",
      "The two-hour hearing was one of about a\u00a0dozen hearings\u00a0scheduled for Trump's top administration picks this week ahead of his return to the White House next week. Though some of the president-elect's designated nominees have been subject to aggressive questioning and tense exchanges, the open portion of Ratcliffe's hearing remained notably civil. None of the Democrats on the committee expressed opposition to his formal nomination and Senate confirmation, though it's not yet clear how many Senate Democrats will vote to confirm him.",
      "Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman, served as director of national intelligence in the final months of President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At that time, Trump initially picked Ratcliffe to lead the nation's spy agencies earlier in his first term, but withdrew his name amid questions about his qualifications for the role. Months later, Trump again nominated Ratcliffe, and the Senate confirmed him as director of national intelligence without any support from Democrats.",
      "Ratcliffe said in his opening remarks Wednesday that \"for roughly a quarter of a century, I have devoted my professional life to U.S. national security.\" And he promised that if confirmed, he would focus on \"setting and communicating priorities and demanding relentless execution.\"",
      "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton kicked off the hearing by listing the ways in which the CIA must \"get back to its roots,\" adding that it \"must overcome several challenges to do so.\" He argued the CIA has become too bureaucratic, and its analysis and priorities have become politicized, among other obstacles.",
      "\"Mr. Ratcliffe, you have a big job ahead of you,\" Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, said. \"The nation needs a strong capable and aggressive CIA.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, agreed with Ratcliffe that the CIA faces an \"unprecedented number of challenges,\" and he mentioned the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, competition with China and the persistent threat of terrorism, which he said requires a \"great deal of leadership.\"",
      "Warner also outlined the importance of ensuring the intelligence community feels \"respected and valued,\" amid what he called \"underserved attacks\" by President-elect Donald Trump. He told Ratcliffe he has an opportunity at his confirmation hearing to \"reassure the men and women of the CIA that they not fear reprisal for being willing to speak truth to power.\"",
      "In Congress, Ratcliffe served on the House Intelligence Committee and House Judiciary Committee and was a staunch defender of Trump through his first impeachment and investigations into Russian election interference.",
      "In his\u00a0confirmation hearing\u00a0in 2020 to be DNI, Ratcliffe vowed to deliver \"objective and timely\" intelligence to senior policymakers and to ensure that it was \"collected, analyzed and reported without bias, prejudice or political influence.\" He also disagreed with Trump about whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election, but declined to take a stance on what Russia's desired outcome was.",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Ratcliffe faced a slew of questions about politicization of the CIA, pledging not to bow to political pressure from the administration or elsewhere or take action for political purposes.",
      "Ratcliffe also responded to questions about how he would resist efforts to force out career civil servants due to their perceived political views or loyalty to Trump, noting that during his time as director of national intelligence \"that never took place\" and is something he \"would never do.\"",
      "He vowed to work on the development of tools \"to go on offense\" against cyber adversaries, warning of the threat to the nation's digital borders \"from half a world away.\"",
      "The committee is proceeding with its questioning in a closed-door session. Cotton said the committee plans to vote on advancing Ratcliffe's nomination as soon as possible, as soon as Monday afternoon, after the inauguration.",
      "Ratcliffe's nomination",
      "Ratcliffe is considered to be a more traditional choice than some of Trump's picks for other roles, since he has served in a Senate-confirmed position once already and was also a member of Congress.",
      "As intelligence director, he was criticized by Democrats for declassifying in the final days of the 2020 presidential election Russian intelligence alleging damaging information about Democrats during the 2016 race even though he acknowledged it might not be true. But like top intelligence officials of Republican and Democratic administrations, he has also been warning for years of the threat posed by China to U.S. interests.",
      "China was among the topics at Wednesday's hearing, and in December 2020, Ratcliffe wrote that China \"poses the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War II.\" Ratcliffe, who was the nation's spy chief at the time, said he had shifted resources in the intelligence budget to make China more of a priority.",
      "\"Beijing is preparing for an open-ended period of confrontation with the U.S. Washington should also be prepared. Leaders must work across partisan divides to understand the threat, speak about it openly, and take action to address it,\" he wrote.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 12:14:24 -0500",
    "summary": "It will be up to the returning Trump administration to decide whether to finalize the rule.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is moving to cut out addictive nicotine from cigarettes, according to a long-awaited proposed regulation released Wednesday.",
      "The rule aims to force the nearly 12% of Americans still using combustible tobacco products to switch to less dangerous alternatives, like vaping electronic cigarettes or using nicotine lozenges, or quit altogether while ending rates of youth starting to smoke traditional cigarettes.",
      "\"The proposed product standard would limit the addictiveness of the most toxic and widely used tobacco products, which would have significant public health benefits for all age groups,\" the agency wrote in the\u00a0proposed rule.",
      "Though vaping rates have climbed in recent years, fewer adults vape than smoke traditional cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 6% of adults use e-cigarettes.",
      "It will now be up to the returning Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize this measure, which was first floated during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At the time, the head of the FDA called it \"one of the most important actions I could take to advance public health.\"",
      "\"If there is a goal to Make America Healthy Again, I can't imagine anything more important to get done than this,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "A related effort to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes stalled out last year under the Biden administration, amid political blowback over the measure.",
      "The FDA says the proposed rule will apply to traditional cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars and pipe tobacco. Cigarette manufacturers will have two years to come into compliance with the rule, after it is finalized.",
      "Agency officials stressed that they were not seeking to ban cigarettes or other tobacco products outright. They acknowledged the rule may result in some illegal imports of high nicotine cigarettes, but not enough to outweigh those switching or quitting. Half of smokers are expected to switch within the first years, they estimate.",
      "\"Even if some amount of illicit trade develops, we will still have a significantly greater magnitude of benefits that would outweigh any impacts of potential illicit markets,\" said Brian King, head of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "Tobacco companies will need to cut nicotine levels to 0.7 milligrams per gram of tobacco, a fraction of the 17.2 milligrams per gram that most cigarette brands have on average.",
      "Why didn't the FDA ban nicotine earlier?",
      "Progress during the Trump administration halted after then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stepped down from the agency, according to a former top-ranking official.",
      "\"We had no champion. And the day came when I was told by political appointees at FDA to stop talking about menthol and nicotine in my speeches. And we were basically told to stop working on them,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products from 2013 to 2022.",
      "The FDA's tobacco arm turned to other priorities in those years, Zeller said. The agency was facing a surge in youth e-cigarette use that began around 2018.",
      "Zeller credited Gottlieb for advocating for the nicotine regulation within the Trump White House, after the Obama administration had fallen short. Obama officials had promised Zeller they would back rules to curb nicotine and menthol.",
      "\"If you look back on the record, you'll see that the Obama administration did absolutely nothing. It was a very frustrating four years,\" Zeller said.",
      "Under President Biden, Zeller said the White House asked him to lay out a timeline for how a nicotine rule could be finalized by the end of 2024. Zeller said he delivered the plan in one of his last acts before retiring, and was not sure why the Biden administration failed to finalize the rule.",
      "\"I would not be forwarding this timeline to you, if I didn't believe in good conscience that it could be met, as long as clearance times could be sped up,\" Zeller recalled telling White House officials.",
      "Califf defended the agency's delay in comments to media Wednesday, saying that the FDA needed to lay the groundwork for steep legal fights over the rule. He pointed to ongoing court battles \"fighting us tooth and nail\" over graphic warnings on cigarettes, saying \"we will be sued, on anything that comes into action.\"",
      "\"The research has to be airtight to survive the challenges that we know we'll get in court,\" he said.",
      "How can nicotine be removed from cigarettes?",
      "Zeller said agency officials carefully studied whether it was possible to require the industry to make cigarettes without addictive levels of nicotine.",
      "\"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Philip Morris sold a very low-nicotine cigarette called Next. Now, it was not commercially successful. But I believe that Philip Morris more than 30 years ago answered the technical feasibility question for themselves and for the rest of us,\" he said.",
      "The Philip Morris cigarette had been produced with a similar process to decaffeinating coffee. At the time, the company had owned Kraft Foods and its decaf coffee production lines.",
      "A major study from the National Institutes of Health in 2015\u00a0that used reduced-nicotine cigarettes that the NIH contracted to manufacture showed reducing nicotine in cigarettes could substantially curb addiction, proving an idea first outlined in the 1990s.",
      "\"That study and a number of confirmatory studies that followed I think provide a very compelling scientific basis for this could be done,\" Zeller said.",
      "Other companies have found different ways to cut nicotine levels. Cigarette company 22nd Century Group earned the FDA's authorization in 2021 using tobacco that is genetically engineered to have 96% lower nicotine.",
      "While feasible to implement, Zeller predicted that finalizing the rule could face steep opposition from the industry.",
      "If successful, the rule would be an \"existential threat,\" he said, eliminating the main reason that smokers continue to use their products.",

      "Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Justice, told the Senate Judiciary Committee\u00a0Wednesday that \"partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end,\" if she is confirmed as attorney general.",
      "\"America must have one tier of justice for all,\" the former Florida attorney general said.\u00a0 Her opening statement was earlier obtained exclusively by CBS News.",
      "The declaration comes as Democrats are expected to pepper the close ally of the president-elect with questions over whether she might weaponize the Justice Department to target Trump's political enemies, including President Biden and former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "The longtime prosecutor, who represented the president-elect during his first impeachment trial, says her \"overriding objective\" is to \"return the Department of Justice to its core mission,\" and vows to get the department \"back to basics \u2013 prosecuting violent crime and gang activity, stopping child predators and drug traffickers, protecting our nation from terrorists and other foreign threats, and addressing the overwhelming crisis at the Border.\"",
      "While seeking the job of the nation's highest ranking law enforcement officer, Bondi also plans to take aim at the Bureau of Prisons, promising to reduce recidivism and reform the federal agency long afflicted by understaffing, abuse, disrepair.",
      "\"We must fix the Bureau of Prisons and follow through on the promise of the First Step Act by building new halfway houses,\" Bondi said, referencing the president elect's hallmark criminal justice reform law. Signed by then-president Trump in 2018, it aims to reduce prison sentences and federal spending, but has been plagued by persistent implementation failures.",
      "\"The Bureau has suffered from years of mismanagement, lack of funding, and low morale. Federal corrections officers serve in challenging conditions on minimal pay and need more support. Our prison system can and will do better,\" Bondi told lawmakers Wednesday.",
      "Echoing the president-elect's promise of a \"new golden age,\" Bondi told lawmakers that Trump is \"unafraid to do things that have been deemed 'too difficult' and to reach across the aisle\" to address criminal justice reform.",
      "Trump selected Bondi to be his nominee for U.S. attorney general after his first pick, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration. Bondi formerly made history in 2010 when she became the first woman to serve as Florida's attorney general, and became an early advocate for Trump during his first bid for the White House in 2016.",
      "Harking on her early days as \"an intern at the Hillsborough County State Attorney's Office,\" Bondi spotlighted her 18 years of experience as a prosecutor and two terms as Florida attorney general, which she claims was defined by a fight to eliminate drug dealers in a state \"overwhelmed by pill mills and opioid deaths.\" While serving as Florida's top cop, Bondi established a prescription drug monitoring program which requires opioid-prescribing clinics to register with the state and have a physician-owner.",
      "\"On the civil side, we worked to protect consumers,\" Bondi said, touting her efforts to tackle \"overreach by big tech companies.\"",
      "If confirmed as attorney general, Bondi would inherit a slew of legal fights against the world's largest technology companies, including ongoing litigation with TikTok and the department's ongoing defense of a law that would force its parent company to sell the platform altogether.",
      "In the weeks leading up to her confirmation hearing, Bondi walked the halls of Capitol Hill, attending back-to-back meetings with senators. Unlike Trump's Gaetz, she is not expected to face significant hurdles to confirmation by the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Considered one of the less controversial choices for Trump's\u00a0new cabinet, Democrats are still likely to probe Bondi on her interpretation of the role of attorney general and commitment to the independence of the Justice Department.",

      "Eighteen million American households struggled with food insecurity in 2023, according to statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In Ohio, help is coming from an unexpected place: the Toledo Public Library.",
      "At the library, Brad Reubendale, former CEO of SAME Caf\u00e9, has transformed traditional library space into a hub for fighting hunger.",
      "Reubendale founded SAME Caf\u00e9 \u2014 an acronym for the words \"So All May Eat\" \u2014 which operates out of a local library and serves lunch to those in need. The caf\u00e9 is a participation restaurant where patrons can either volunteer, pay what they can afford or exchange fresh produce for a meal.",
      "In Toledo, Ohio, about a third of customers volunteer their time in return for food, while two-thirds make some form of financial contribution. A small number of patrons also provide produce in exchange for a meal. The caf\u00e9 works closely with local farms and gardens to source most of its fresh ingredients.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:31:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The red food dye is used in products ranging from candies to vegetarian meats.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday it had decided to revoke Red 3's authorization to be added to foods, over concerns about how the food coloring dye has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.",
      "FDA officials have telegraphed the decision for months. While the agency has long said that it did not think evidence of Red 3 causing cancer applied to humans, officials said their hand was forced by a law requiring the agency to pull additives that are cancerous in animals.",
      "\"The Delaney Clause is clear; the FDA cannot authorize a food additive or color additive if it has been found to cause cancer in humans or animals. Evidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No. 3,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, referring to the law.",
      "A post on the FDA's website states that Red 3's use in food or drugs \"puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.\"",
      "Hundreds of food brands, including products ranging from candy and fruit cups to snack chips and tomato sauce, have contained Red 3 at some point, according to databases maintained by the\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0and the nonprofit\u00a0Environmental Working Group, as well as nutrition labels disclosed by food companies.",
      "Wednesday's decision stems from a petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a number of other groups in 2022, calling for the additive to be pulled from the market. Food brands will have until January 2027 to stop using the dye.",
      "The group has also championed a move by California in 2023 to ban the food dye, which is already banned from use in cosmetics.",
      "\"The primary purpose of food dyes is to make candy, drinks, and other processed foods more attractive. When the function is purely aesthetic, why accept any cancer risk?\" said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in a statement.",
      "While the group has highlighted Red 3's link to cancer in pushes to ban the additive, it is concerns over a different health concern \u2014 the possibility that artificial food dyes could be causing hyperactivity in children \u2014 that has fueled opposition to this and another dye called Red 40 used in many U.S. food products.",
      "An influential review by California''s Environmental Protection Agency of studies on synthetic food dyes, including Red 3, concluded in 2021 that colorants \"can impact neurobehavior in some children.\"",
      "What foods and drinks contain Red 3?",
      "Red 3 has been authorized for use in at least some foods by countries around the world, according to the International Association of Color Manufacturers, under other names like erythrosine or E 127. In Europe, Red 3 is only permitted for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries.",
      "In the U.S., Red 3 is used in some candies, including Jelly Belly's Candy Corn, Tootsie's Dubble Bubble ball gum and Ring Pop's strawberry and berry blast flavors. Other foods also use Red 3, like Del Monte cherry mixed fruit cups, MorningStar Farms vegetarian Bacon Strips and Pillsbury's birthday cake cookie dough.",
      "Several drinks rely on Red 3 as well, among them Ensure's creamy peach nutrition shake and Nesquik's strawberry lowfat milk.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the candy industry pledged to comply with the FDA's guidance and safety standards. Industry groups have been calling on the agency to step up its regulation of food additives, citing concerns that a vacuum left by FDA inaction could lead to a frustrating patchwork of state laws for national food brands.",
      "\"Our consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework. We have been saying for years that FDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety,\" said the National Confections Association's statement.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the federal department that will oversee the FDA, has been critical of the agency for not moving to curb use of certain food additives.",
      "Kennedy and his allies have\u00a0also called for\u00a0tightening the FDA's approach to regulating food additives, which critics have derided as a \"loophole\" allowing in concerning ingredients. That process is separate from artificial colors like Red 3 and Red 40, which must jump through steep hurdles to gain the FDA's authorization and are carefully tested for purity before being used in the market.",

      "In his foreign policy speech, the president sought to make the case that America's position on the global stage and with its allies is stronger than it was when he took office four years ago.

      "The president also stood by his decision to withdraw the U.S. from Afghanistan, which brought an end to America's longest war, but cost the lives of 13 service members and dozens of Afghan civilians in a terrorist attack at the Hamid Karzai Airport in Kabul.",
      "The next administration will inherit its own set of challenges, Mr. Biden pointed out, including a growing relationship between Russia and North Korea, Russia's continued war on Ukraine, tensions in the South China Sea and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.",
      "The economy",
      "The Biden administration has argued the country is better off economically since he took office, pointing to his efforts to lower drug prices, the enactment of the bipartisan infrastructure law and unemployment levels that have remained low.",
      "The U.S. unemployment rate was 6.4% when Mr. Biden took office, with the economy still reeling from the global COVID pandemic. The president leaves office with an unemployment rate of 4.1% in December.",
      "Mr. Biden said in the letter that he entered office under the \"worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,\" while touting that four years later, \"we have the strongest economy in the world and have created a record 16.6 million new jobs.\"",
      "But inflation has also battered Americans' pocketbooks and voters who sent Republicans to the White House and Congress cited inflation and higher prices as their top issue.",

      "In 2022, Congress passed the most significant gun control legislation in decades, with Republican support. It expanded firearm background checks, and addressed the ties between gun violence and mental health.",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act, though criticized for doing little to lower inflation, did make it possible for the administration to embark on negotiations to lower drug costs. The law also contained the most significant climate change measures ever enacted.",

      "Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi says if President Biden offered him a preemptive pardon for his role in leading the investigation into then-President Donald Trump's role in the 2021 Capitol riot, he'd accept it.",
      "Thompson, who was the chair of the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, embraced the idea of a pardon in an interview with CBS News, saying Tuesday, \"I'm from a part of the country where speaking your opinion used to cost you your life.\"",
      "\"When I hear someone about to be sworn into the presidency of the United States say he wants to lock you up for doing your job, I believe it,\" he said of Trump, now the president-elect.",
      "\"And so, if for Bennie Thompson, that is something that's offered to me, I will accept it,\" the Democrat added, \"because there are a lot of people who take this person at his word, and I don't want him to weaponize (the) government against people for doing their job.\"",
      "President Biden has said he's continuing to weigh possible blanket preemptive pardons for prominent critics and political enemies of Trump, a move that could shield them from prosecution by the incoming administration. The president has not said who might receive such a pardon.",
      "The president-elect has openly threatened members of the now-defunct House committee.",
      "In an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" last month, the incoming president accused members of the panel of destroying evidence and committing \"a major crime\" during their investigation. He said that \"everybody\" who served on the committee \"should go to jail.\"",
      "Asked Tuesday about Trump's claim that the committee had destroyed evidence, Thompson noted that House Republicans have been conducting their own investigation of the select committee's work for two years. \"They've not come up with anything,\" Thompson said.",
      "But Thompson appears to be the only member of the select committee who would welcome a pardon ahead of Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. Several of the panel's members have rejected the idea, arguing they don't need a pardon because they committed no wrongdoing in the course of their work.",
      "Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat, told reporters on Tuesday, \"I stand by the work that we did. We didn't do anything wrong. I don't think a pardon is necessary.\"",

Jamie Raskin of Maryland said he didn't know what the right answer was when asked at a Politico Live event about the possibility Mr. Biden could pardon\u00a0members of the select committee. He argued that \"in any just world,\" they wouldn't need a pardon because they hadn't committed any crimes.",
      "He also noted that the Constitution's \"speech and debate\" clause protects members against criminal prosecution and civil lawsuits related to their legislative work.",
      "Some of the panel's other former members have discouraged pardons.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, told CBS News in December that he did not think the idea of a blanket pardon \"of any kind\" was a good idea, and would recommend against it.",

I'm guilty of nothing besides bringing the truth to the American people and in the process, embarrassing Donald Trump.\"",

    "story": [
      "Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage release agreement to halt more than a year of fighting in the Gaza Strip, President Biden and Qatar's prime minister announced separately on Wednesday. The deal comes after a week of intense negotiations mediated by Qatar, the U.S. and Egypt.",
      "\"Today, after many months of intensive diplomacy by the United States, along with Egypt and Qatar, Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage deal,\" Mr. Biden said in a written statement. \"This deal will halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much needed-humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families after more than 15 months in captivity.\"",
      "Speaking from the White House Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Biden said, \"There was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal, and I'm deeply satisfied this day has finally come, for the sake of the people of Israel, and for the families waiting in agony, and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war.\"",
      "He said Americans will be among the hostages released in phase one of the deal, \"and the vice president and I cannot wait to welcome them home.\"",
      "The deal is expected to take effect Sunday.",
      "As news of the agreement broke, crowds gathered in Deir al Bala in Gaza, and celebratory gunfire was heard.",
      "\"I'm extremely happy,\" one young Palestinian woman in the Gaza city of Khan Younis CBS News. \"The past 15 months I experienced tears, laughters, lost martyrs and people went into prison, but finally I feel the joy.\"",
      "\"I am very happy, and today is the day I wished to hear about since the beginning of the war,\" an elderly man said. \"God is sending us hope,\" he added.",
      "The ceasefire is not yet in effect, and Israeli airstrikes continued Wednesday in Gaza City and Khan Younis after the news broke.",
      "The families of the American hostages still being held in Gaza expressed their relief at the news of a deal.",
      "\"We are deeply grateful that there is finally an agreement between Israel and Hamas to bring our loved ones \u2014 Omer, Edan, Sagui, Itay, Keith, Gad, and Judi \u2014 home,\" the families said in a statement. \"We have been waiting for 467 days while our family members suffer from life-threatening injuries, abuse, torture, and sexual violence. We thank President Biden, President-elect Trump, and their teams for their constructive efforts to make this possible.\"",
      "A draft of the deal had been agreed to in principle earlier in the week, Arab, U.S. and Israeli officials told CBS News. It sets out a phased framework for a ceasefire and the exchange of hostages still held by Hamas for a larger number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. It also includes access for humanitarian aid to Gaza and the eventual ability of Palestinians in Gaza to return to areas they fled.",
      "Intense negotiations had been underway in Doha for the past few weeks, with President Biden's top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, staying in the region for the better part of a month. McGurk has been closely coordinating with President-elect Donald Trump's pick for special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. Mr. Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone on Sunday about the negotiations.",
      "In Israel, families of the approximately 100 hostages still being held after Hamas' brutal Oct. 7 2023 attack, which saw the group and allied militants kill about 1,200 people, have been holding regular rallies demanding a negotiated deal for the release of their loved ones. The Israel Defense Forces has said it believes around a third of the hostages have already died.",
      "More than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israeli strikes since the war began, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, and most of Gaza's population is displaced and living in camps. Humanitarian groups have been struggling to deliver aid, and experts have warned of famine.",
      "What is in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal?",
      "Details of the deal are similar to a plan outlined by Mr. Biden last year. The deal is expected to go into effect on Sunday.",
      "According to a draft from mediator sources, viewed by CBS News earlier this week, and Mr. Biden's description, it would consist of three phases, each lasting about 42 days.",
      "During the first phase, Hamas would release 33 women and children hostages, as well as hostages over 50 years old, the draft viewed by CBS News said. The first phase will also include the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, Mr. Biden said.",
      "For each woman or child hostage returned to Israel, Israel is expected to release 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older.",
      "A senior Israeli official told CBS News that the release of hostages from Israel would begin on the first day of a 42-day ceasefire period. Mr. Biden said Americans will be among the first wave of hostages released.",
      "On that first day, Hamas would release three hostages, according to the draft viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release four hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release three hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said. International aid groups and the United Nations would resume operations in Gaza, and would begin reconstruction of the enclave's infrastructure, such as water, electricity and sewage systems.",
      "The second phase of the deal would involve the release of all remaining male Israeli hostages and the withdrawal of all IDF forces from Gaza, the president announced Wednesday.",
      "The third phase would include the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and prisoners and the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza, Mr. Biden said.",
      "Trump responds to ceasefire and hostage release deal",
      "In his remarks, Mr. Biden noted that the deal will largely be implemented after his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, takes office.",
      "\"This deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented, for the most part, by the next administration,\" the president said. \"For these past few days, we've been speaking as one team.\"",
      "Trump posted on social media as news broke of the hostage and ceasefire agreement.",
      "\"This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,\" Trump wrote. \"I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.\"",
      "Trump said his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel \"to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven.\"",
      "\"We have achieved so much without even being in the White House,\" Trump wrote. \"Just imagine all of the wonderful things that will happen when I return to the White House, and my Administration is fully confirmed, so they can secure more Victories for the United States!\"",

    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 South Korea's impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol was detained in a massive law enforcement operation at the presidential compound Wednesday, defiantly insisting the anti-corruption agency didn't have the authority to investigate his actions but saying he complied to prevent violence.",
      "In a video message recorded before he was escorted to the headquarters of the anti-corruption agency, Yoon lamented the \"rule of law has completely collapsed in this country.\"",
      "Yoon, the country's first sitting president to be apprehended, had been holed up in the Hannam-dong residence in the capital, Seoul, for weeks while vowing to \"fight to the end\" the efforts to oust him. He has justified his brief declaration of martial law on Dec. 3 as a legitimate act of governance against an \"anti-state\" opposition employing its legislative majority to thwart his agenda.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials said Yoon was brought into custody about five hours after investigators arrived at the presidential compound and about three hours after they successfully entered the residence, in their second attempt to detain him over his imposition of martial law.",
      "A series of black SUVs, some equipped with sirens, were seen leaving the presidential compound with police escorts. Yoon was later seen stepping out of a vehicle after arriving at the agency's office in the nearby city of Gwacheon.",
      "Hundreds of Yoon's conservative supporters rallied near the anti-corruption agency's office as he underwent questioning, shouting slogans and holding signs that read: \"We will fight alongside President Yoon Suk Yeol.\"",
      "An unidentified man was in life-threatening condition after an apparent self-immolation near the site, according to the Gyeonggi provincial fire department.",
      "Following the questioning, Yoon was sent to a detention center in Uiwang, near Seoul. He could be held in custody for weeks.",
      "The anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with the police and the military over whether Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an attempted rebellion, has 48 hours to request a court order for a formal arrest on a charge of attempting a rebellion, and if it fails to do so, Yoon will be released. If Yoon is formally arrested, investigators can extend his detention to 20 days before transferring the case to public prosecutors for indictment.",
      "The anti-corruption agency told reporters that Yoon, during his first two hours of questioning, exercised his right to remain silent.",
      "The detainment warrant for Yoon, issued by the Seoul Western District Court, said there were substantial reasons to suspect that he committed crimes as a \"ringleader of a rebellion.\"",
      "Yoon's presidential powers were suspended when parliament impeached him on Dec. 14. The impeachment case now rests with the Constitutional Court, which could formally remove Yoon from office or reject the case and reinstate him.",
      "In a separate message posted on his Facebook account after his detainment, Yoon claimed that \"martial law is not a crime,\" saying his declaration was necessary to raise awareness about an opposition that was exercising \"legislative dictatorship by blocking laws and budgets\" and \"paralyzing\" state affairs. He denied the rebellion accusations, describing his impeachment as \"fraud.\"",
      "As they began the detention operation in the early morning, the anti-corruption investigators and police officers engaged in an hourslong standoff at the compound's gate with presidential security forces but otherwise encountered no meaningful resistance.",
      "Police officers were seen using wire cutters to remove the barbed wire placed by the presidential security service on the perimeter of the compound to block their entry. Some police officers used ladders to climb over rows of buses placed by the presidential security service near the compound's entrance, and then the investigators began moving up the hilly compound. The investigators and police later arrived in front of a metal gate with a gold presidential mark that's near Yoon's residential building. Some officers were seen entering a security door on the side of the metal gate, joined by one of Yoon's lawyers and his chief of staff. The presidential security service later removed a bus and other vehicles that had been parked tightly inside the gate as a barricade.",
      "Despite a court warrant for Yoon's detention, the presidential security service had insisted it's obligated to protect the impeached president and fortified the compound with barbed wire and rows of buses blocking paths.",
      "South Korea's acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, issued a statement early Wednesday urging law enforcement and the presidential security service to ensure there are no \"physical clashes.\"",
      "Following Yoon's detainment, Choi met with diplomats from the Group of Seven nations, including the United States, Japan, Britain and Germany, as well as the representative of the European Union, to reassure them that the government was functioning stably.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, which drove the legislative campaign that led to Yoon's impeachment on Dec. 14, said Yoon's detention is the \"first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy, and realizing the rule of law.\"",
      "As investigators moved up the hillside compound, lawmakers from Yoon's People Power Party held a rally in nearby streets, decrying the efforts to detain him as unlawful.",
      "The National Police Agency met with field commanders in Seoul and nearby Gyeonggi province in recent days to plan their detainment efforts, and the size of those forces fueled speculation that more than a thousand officers could be deployed. The agency and police had openly warned that presidential bodyguards obstructing the execution of the warrant could be arrested.",
      "Yoon's lawyers have claimed that the detainment warrant issued by the Seoul Western District Court was invalid. They cited a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge \u2014 which would be Yoon. They also claimed that the anti-corruption agency had no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations.",
      "\"I am truly appalled to see illegalities upon illegalities upon illegalities being carried out and procedures being forcefully conducted under an invalid warrant,\" Yoon said in the video released before his detention. \"I do not acknowledge the investigation by the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials. As the president, who is responsible for upholding the constitution and legal system of the Republic of Korea, my decision to comply with such illegal and invalid procedures is not an acknowledgment of them, but rather a willingness to prevent unfortunate and bloody incidents.\"",
      "Yoon's supporters and critics have held competing protests near the residence \u2014 one side vowing to protect him, the other calling for his imprisonment \u2014 while thousands of police officers in yellow jackets closely monitored the tense situation.",
      "Yoon declared martial law and deployed troops around the National Assembly on Dec. 3. It lasted only hours before lawmakers managed to get through the blockade and vote to lift the measure. \u00a0The opposition-led assembly voted to impeach him on rebellion charges Dec. 14.",
      "The Constitutional Court held its first formal hearing in the impeachment case on Tuesday, but the session lasted less than five minutes because Yoon refused to attend. The next hearing is set for Thursday, and the court will then proceed with the trial whether or not Yoon is there.",
      "The White House National Security Council issued a statement saying that the United States stands by its support for the Korean people and \"our shared commitment to the rule of law.\" It said Washington remains committed to working with the government led by Seoul's acting leader, Choi, and reaffirms the strength of the countries' alliance.",

    "summary": "Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada decided to stick with the lawyer defending him from U.S. drug trafficking charges despite a possible conflict of interest.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. prosecutors said Wednesday that they're discussing a potential plea deal with Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the long-elusive Mexican drug lord who was arrested last summer and whose son could testify against him if he goes to trial.",
      "Assistant U.S. attorney Francisco Navarro said the plea discussions with Zambada, a leader of Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel, haven't borne fruit so far, but prosecutors want to keep trying. A judge scheduled an April 22 hearing for an update.",
      "Zambada's lead attorney, Frank Perez, declined to comment on the discussions.",
      "It's common for prosecutors and defense lawyers to explore whether they can reach a deal, and the talks don't necessarily go anywhere.",
      "Zambada was an attentive and active participant during Wednesday's hearing, which focused on whether he wanted Perez to continue representing him even while also representing a potential government witness in the case - Zambada's son Vicente Zambada.",
      "\"I don't want a different attorney,\" the father said through a court interpreter. \"I want him, even though this could be a conflict if he represents me and my son.\"",
      "The younger Zambada was charged himself and made a plea deal in the long-running and sprawling U.S. prosecutions of Sinaloa cartel figures. He testified for the government at the trial of the cartel's infamous and now imprisoned co-founder, Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n.",
      "Working alongside Guzm\u00e1n, Ismael Zambada kept a lower profile and was seen as concentrating more on the business of smuggling than the extremes of brutality, serving as a strategist and dealmaker who engaged with day-to-day operations, authorities say.",
      "At Guzm\u00e1n's trial, Vicente Zambada recounted how his father and Guzm\u00e1n ran the cartel together. At one point, he described corrupt Mexican politicians asking whether the syndicate could help them ship 100 tons of cocaine in an oil tanker.",
      "\"They wanted to know if my dad and Chapo could provide that amount of coke,\" he told a jury in the same Brooklyn federal courthouse where his father is being prosecuted. At another point, Vicente Zambada recalled hearing a rival drug gang leader say he wanted to kill Ismael Zambada and Guzm\u00e1n to avenge a botched hit.",
      "Prosecutors said in a court document last month that the son might be called to testify against his father, which could pose a conflict of interest for Perez. For instance, he'd be hindered in cross-examining the son because of the loyalty he owes both clients.",
      "Defense lawyers do sometimes have potential conflicts of interest regarding a client, and federal courts have outlined the steps judges should take to address such situations. Among them is having an independent lawyer advise defendants as they consider what to do about the possible conflict. Zambada had one at Wednesday's hearing.",
      "Zambada said he realized there could be problems with Perez representing him and his son - \"for example, that he will have to hide information that he obtained from Vicente from me.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan ultimately agreed that Perez could stay on the case, noting that Ismael Zambada also has other lawyers who could handle any piece of it relating to his son.",
      "Law enforcement sought the elder Zambada for years before his startling arrest in July at an airport near El Paso, Texas, after arriving in a private plane with one of Guzm\u00e1n's sons, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez. He, too, was wanted by U.S. authorities.",
      "Zambada has said he was kidnapped in Mexico and hauled to the U.S. by Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, whose lawyer denies those claims. Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and his brother Ovidio are in plea negotiations with the U.S. government, their lawyers said this month in a Chicago courtroom.",
      "Following the July arrests and Zambada's allegations of kidnapping, horrific fighting erupted in Mexico between a cartel faction loyal to him and another tied to the \"Chapitos,\" Guzm\u00e1n's sons.",
      "The Chapitos have used corkscrews, electrocution and hot chiles to\u00a0torture their rivals\u00a0while some of their victims were \"fed dead or alive to tigers,\" according to an indictment released by the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "In recent months, bodies have appeared across Sinaloa, often left slung out on the streets or in cars with either\u00a0sombreros on their heads\u00a0or pizza slices or boxes pegged onto them with knives. The pizzas and sombreros have become informal symbols for the warring cartel factions, underscoring the brutality of their warfare.",
      "The chain of events also strained relations between Mexico and the United States.",
      "First, Mexico's president at the time, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and current President Claudia Sheinbaum laid part of the blame for the bloodshed at Washington's feet, saying the U.S. arrests uncorked trouble.",
      "The outgoing U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, responded that it was \"incomprehensible\" to suggest the cartel wars were Washington's fault. He subsequently asserted that the Mexican government had stopped cooperating with Washington on fighting cartels and was sticking its head in the sand about violence and police corruption.",

      "The Russian Defense Ministry said that it launched a strike on \"critically important facilities of gas and energy infrastructure that ensure the functioning of Ukraine's military industrial complex.\" It didn't give the target locations or other details.",
      "The barrage came a day after the Russian Defense Ministry vowed a response to what it said was an attack on Russian soil using multiple Western-supplied missiles. Kyiv hasn't confirmed that attack, though it said Tuesday that it hit an oil refinery and a fuel storage depot, a chemical plant producing ammunition and two anti-aircraft missile systems, in a missile and drone attack that reached almost 700 miles into Russia.",
      "Long-range attacks have been a feature of the nearly three-year war, where on the front line snaking about 600 miles from northeast to southern Ukraine, the armies have been engaged in a war of attrition. Russia has been advancing on the battlefield over the past year, though its progress has been slow and costly.",
      "Russia attacked Ukraine with 43 missiles and 74 drones overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force said. A total of 30 missiles and 47 drones were shot down, and 27 drones failed to reach their target, it said.",
      "The Russian missiles sought out targets from the Lviv region in western Ukraine near Poland to Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine bordering Russia. The state energy company Ukrenergo reported emergency power outages in six regions. It often shuts down production during attacks as a precaution.",
      "\"The enemy continues to terrorize Ukrainians,\" Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook.",
      "Electricity supplies resumed to households in some areas by the middle of the day, but Ukrenergo urged customers to avoid using power-hungry electrical appliances.",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to cripple Ukraine's power grid, denying the country heat, electricity and running water in an effort to break the Ukrainian spirit. The attacks have also sought to disrupt Ukraine's defense manufacturing industry.",
      "Last September, the U.N. refugee agency reported that Ukraine had lost more than an estimated 60% of its energy generation capacity.",
      "Ukrainian authorities try to rebuild their power generation after the attack, though the barrages have eroded production. Western partners have been helping Ukraine rebuild.",
      "\"It is the middle of the winter, and Russia's goal remains unchanged: our energy infrastructure,\" Zelenskyy said on Telegram.",

      "If final details are approved, and the Israeli government also votes to approve it shortly thereafter, implementation of the deal could begin this weekend, U.S. and regional sources said. That means President Biden's long-sought ceasefire deal could come together in the final days of his presidency, and incoming President-elect Donald Trump would oversee its implementation.",

For each woman or child hostage returned to Israel, Israel would release 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older.",
      "On the first day of that ceasefire, Hamas would release 3 hostages, according to the document viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release 4 hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release 3 hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said. International aid groups and the United Nations would resume operation in Gaza, and reconstruction of its infrastructure, like water, electricity and sewage systems, would begin. There would also be negotiations over the next phase of the deal.",
      "The second phase of the deal would involve the release of all the Israeli male hostages and the withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza, according to the document viewed by CBS News.",
      "The third phase, which would be partially negotiated during earlier phases, would include the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and prisoners, the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza, and the opening of its borders.",

      "\"Bardarbunga is unique in that it is an unusually large volcanic system, partly covered by a glacier, and several scenarios are possible,\" the agency said. \"Extensive research, along with hazard assessments and contingency planning, was conducted during the 2014\u20132015 eruption, which will prove valuable should further volcanic activity occur.\"",
      "That eruption created Iceland's biggest basalt lava flow in more than 230 years but caused no injuries or damage.",
      "Iceland has seen seven volcanic eruptions in a year near the southwestern fishing village of Grindavik, leading to the evacuation of the town. After the seventh eruption, people were evacuated from about 50 homes in Grindav\u00edk, according to the country's\u00a0Civil Protection Agency.",
      "Iceland is home to 33 active volcanic systems, more than any other European country.",
      "It is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to\u00a0earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which have rocked portions of the country and displaced residents in recent years.",

      "The files about royal art historian Anthony Blunt are among a trove from the intelligence agency MI5 released Tuesday by Britain's National Archives. They shed new light on a spy ring linked to Cambridge University in the 1930s, whose members spilled secrets to the Soviet Union from the heart of the U.K. intelligence establishment.",
      "Blunt, who worked at Buckingham Palace as Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, was under suspicion for years before he finally confessed in 1964 that, as a senior MI5 officer during World War II, he had passed secret information to Soviet agents.",
      "In one of the newly released files, an MI5 officer notes that Blunt said he felt \"profound relief\" at unburdening himself. In return for information he provided, Blunt was allowed to keep his job, his knighthood and his social standing \u2013 and the queen was apparently kept in the dark.",
      "In 1972, her private secretary, Martin Charteris, told MI5 chief Michael Hanley that \"the queen did not know and he saw no advantage in telling her about it now; it would only add to her worries and there was nothing that could done about him.\"",
      "The government decided to tell the monarch in 1973, when Blunt was ill, fearing a media uproar once Blunt died and journalists were able to publish stories without fear of libel suits.",
      "Charteris reported that \"she took it all very calmly and without surprise,\" and \"remembered that he had been under suspicion way back\" in the early 1950s. Historian Christopher Andrew says in the official history of MI5 that the queen had previously been told about Blunt in \"general terms.\"",
      "Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022 at the age of 96.",
      "Blunt was publicly unmasked as a spy by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the House of Commons in November 1979. He was finally stripped of his knighthood, but never prosecuted, and died in 1983 at the age of 75.",
      "Files held by Britain's secretive intelligence services usually remain classified for several decades, but the agencies are inching toward more openness. Some of the newly released documents will feature in an exhibition, entitled \"MI5: Official Secrets,\" opening at the National Archives in London later this year.",
      "Two of the Cambridge spies, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess, fled to Russia in 1951. A third, Kim Philby, continued to work for foreign intelligence agency MI6 despite falling under suspicion. As evidence of his duplicity mounted, he was confronted in Beirut in January 1963 by his friend and fellow MI6 officer Nicholas Elliott.",
      "The declassified files include Philby's typed confession and a transcript of his discussion with Elliott.",
      "In it, Philby admitted he had betrayed Konstantin Volkov, a KGB officer who tried to defect to the West in 1945, bringing with him details of moles inside British intelligence \u2013 including Philby himself. As a result of Philby's intervention, Volkov was abducted in Istanbul, taken back to Moscow and executed.",
      "Elliott reported that Philby said that if he had his life to lead again, he would probably have behaved in the same way.",
      "\"I really did feel a tremendous loyalty to MI6. I was treated very, very well in it and I made some really marvelous friends there,\" Philby said, according to the transcript. \"But the overruling inspiration was the other side.\"",
      "Philby told Elliott that the choice faced now that he was exposed was \"between suicide and prosecution.\" Instead, he fled to Moscow, where he died in 1988.",

    "story": [
      "With a world at war in Ukraine, the Middle East and Sudan, President Biden argued in a speech at the State Department on Monday that his administration has strengthened partnerships around the world, bettered the United States' position on the global stage and weakened key adversaries.",
      "When Mr. Biden took office four years ago, he sought to reassure global allies and reestablish foreign treaties from which the Trump administration had withdrawn. The president reestablished strong relationships with leaders of NATO countries in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and reentered the Paris climate agreement. But world leaders have been preparing for significant changes with President-elect Donald Trump's impending inauguration.",
      "\"I come here to the State Department to report to the American people on the progress we've made in the last four years, in our foreign policy, in our presidency,\" Mr. Biden said. \"I've said many times, we are at an inflection point. The post Cold-War era is over. A new era has begun. In these four years, we faced crises, we've been tested, we've come through those tests, stronger in my view, than we entered those tests. This is a fierce competition underway. The future of the global economy, technology, human values and so much else. Right now, in my view, thanks to our administration, the United States is winning the world-wide competition.\"",
      "Specifically, the president made the case that the United States' partnerships and transnational institutions are significantly stronger than they were before he took office, a key claim of his presidency.",
      "\"Today, I can report to the American people, our alliances are stronger than they've been in decades,\" he said. \"NATO is more capable than it's ever been. And many more of our allies are paying their fair share.\"",
      "But the president also sought to make the case that the United States' \"adversaries are weaker than they were when we came into this job four years ago.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin has \"failed\" to subjugate Ukraine and weaken NATO. The president touted his work to rally the world around Ukraine, another central piece of his foreign policy.",
      "\"As I saw it, when Putin launched his invasion, I had two jobs \u2014 one to rally the world to defend Ukraine, and the other is to avoid war between two nuclear powers,\" Mr. Biden said. \"We did both those things. Today, Ukraine is still a free, independent country, with a potential, a potential for a bright future.\"",
      "He also argued that Iran is weaker than it's been in \"decades,\" saying Iran's main proxy Hezbollah is \"badly wounded\" and Iran's economy is in \"desperate straits.\"",
      "Something that has remained elusive for the Biden administration is the freeing of the hostages Hamas captured in Israel, which has been a top priority for the president and his aides. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said before Mr. Biden's speech on Monday the parties are \"close to a deal and it can get done this week,\" but also said he couldn't make a promise or a prediction.",
      "In his speech, the president briefly mentioned the soldiers who died during the chaotic and deadly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, while emphasizing that he has been the president to end United States' involvement in its longest war.",
      "\"We grieve all 2,461 Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in the longest war in American history,\" he said. \"And I grieve those brave service members whose lives were lost during the withdrawal.\"",
      "Thirteen U.S. service members\u00a0died in an attack\u00a0outside of the Kabul airport amid the evacuation as the Taliban took over control of the country faster than the U.S. expected.",
      "Mr. Biden also laid out the challenges ahead for the incoming Trump administration, which will have to deal with a chaotic Middle East, Russia's nearly three-year war on Ukraine and a tenuous situation in the Red Sea.",
      "\"Make no mistake, there are serious challenges the United States must continue to deal with, in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in the Indo-Pacific,\" he said. \"Must keep the pressure on the Houthis who are attacking ships in the Red Sea, launching missiles at Israel, and firing at American forces. Must deter North Korea as they rattle their saber and draw closer to Russia. And new challenges will certainly emerge in the months and years ahead.\"",
      "\"But even \u2014 but even so, it's clear,\" he continued. \"My administration is leaving the next administration with a very strong hand to play. And we're leaving an America with more friends and stronger alliances, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure. An America that once again is leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together behind our plans and visions.\"",
      "The president recently told USA Today that he had helped reset ties that had frayed during the Trump administration, saying he had managed an \"inflection point\" in history. He credited his long history in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with helping him \"navigate some of the fundamental changes taking place, whether it's in Europe, in Latin America, in the Middle East, in the Far East.\"",
      "\"The only advantage of being an old guy is that I've known every major world leader for a long time,\" he told USA Today's Susan Page. \"And so I had a perspective on each of them and their interests.\"",
      "Jake Sullivan said the president will argue \"America is winning that contest for the future.\"",
      "In his first foreign policy speech as president, in 2021, Mr. Biden aimed to tie foreign and domestic policy interests by arguing for a foreign policy for the middle class. The focus was meant to be on China and repairing alliances but was disrupted by crises in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "\"The United States is in a worse geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,\" says Stephen Wertheim, historian and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The United States is immersed in a massive war on the European continent with serious escalation risks; it's back to bombing the Middle East with no end in sight; and it has entered into a full-spectrum strategic rivalry with China.\"",
      "A look at the major foreign policy issues of his presidency:",
      "Ukraine, Russia and NATO",
      "Mr. Biden has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, becoming the first president to go to a conflict zone where U.S. troops were not involved and directing over $183 billion dollars in military aid since Russia's invasion in 2021. He played a key role in getting NATO to spend more on collective defense.",
      "Yet the fierce battle continues on the frontlines with no clear plan for a peace deal. Washington deferred to Kyiv on when and how negotiations should take place with the tagline \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\"",
      "The administration was criticized early in the conflict for holding back on sending the most lethal weapons and later by some Republicans for spending too much money on Ukraine aid.",
      "Mr. Biden is expected to argue that his policies have ensured the survival of Ukraine as an independent state and thwarted Putin's ambitions, a senior administration official tells CBS News.",
      "Israel-Hamas war",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed over 1,200 civilians, Mr. Biden made it clear that Israel has the right to defend itself with his administration sending over billions of dollars worth of military assistance.",
      "As Israel launched a war on Gaza that has killed more than 45,000 people according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry and led to a humanitarian crisis, the administration did not change its stance.",
      "In April 2023, Mr. Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu that future U.S. support of his country was dependent on Israel protecting civilians and aid workers in Gaza.",
      "\"Biden willingly threw away his leverage by immediately pledging military support for Israel; then he criticized the Israeli government's decisions from the self-imposed sidelines,\" Wertheim said.",
      "The State Department informed Congress earlier this month of a planned $8 billion weapons transfer to Israel. Ceasefire negotiations are still underway between Israel and Hamas as pressure mounts for a deal to be reached prior to Trump's inauguration on January 20.",
      "Chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal",
      "The most glaring foreign policy failure was the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Mr. Biden had promised to end America's longest war and assured Americans that the Afghan military was capable of holding off a Taliban takeover. Instead the Taliban expanded its control of territory across the country more quickly than the U.S. expected and seized Kabul as the Afghan government collapsed. The U.S. hastily evacuated about 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans, over the course of its frenzied withdrawal, but dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were\u00a0killed in a suicide bombing\u00a0outside Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul as thousands sought to flee the country.",
      "U.S. citizens and Afghan allies who supported American troops throughout the war were left behind. Thousands feared retribution from the Taliban and felt abandoned by an American government that had promised to take care of them.",
      "Images of Afghans clinging onto military planes in hopes of escape, and U.S. military weapons left behind and paraded about by the Taliban became emblematic of the missteps leading up to the evacuation.",
      "In the three years since the Taliban returned to power, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have established a presence in the country, and\u00a0Afghan women and girls have been deprived of basic freedoms\u00a0they enjoyed during two decades of Western-backed government following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.",
      "China",
      "Trump began a trade war with China\u00a0and other countries during his first term, imposing tariffs that were aimed at deterring what he saw as unfair trade practices and to encourage American consumers and businesses to buy and sell more goods made at home. While the rhetoric changed under Mr Biden, he nonetheless continued the tariff policy. And as was the case during the Trump administration, both have viewed China as a security threat, not just an economic one.",
      "The Biden administration put safeguards in place to help protect industries like chip production from relying on China. Global alliances such as the Quad \u2014\u00a0 U.S., India, Japan and Australia \u2014\u00a0 and AUKUS \u2013 Australia, the U.S. and U.K. \u2013 made diplomatic and military headway in deterrence against China. And the Biden administration has also enhanced its military alliance with Japan.",
      "Mr. Biden was vice president when former President Barack Obama delivered his \"pivot to Asia\" speech. American policymakers have been attempting to shift foreign policy focus ever since, but there has been a world of distractions along the way.",
      "\"The United States cannot expect to prioritize China while remaining the leading military power in Europe and the Middle East. If the United States truly wants to prioritize China, it needs to pull back elsewhere,\"\u00a0 Wertheim said.",

    "story": [
      "In a roughly 30-minute phone call Sunday afternoon, President Biden delivered difficult news to the families of three Americans held by the Taliban. He did not have a deal with the Taliban to free their loved ones from captivity, despite what U.S. officials described to CBS News as a significant offer the U.S. had extended in Doha days earlier. The U.S. considers Ryan Corbett and George Glezmann to be wrongfully detained by the Taliban, and describes Mahmood Habibi, who holds dual American and Afghan citizenship, as \"unjustly held\" since 2022.",
      "Ahmad Shah Habibi, the brother of Mahmood Habibi, told CBS News that during the conversation, Mr. Biden clarified that he would not agree to the Taliban's demand that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al Afghani, a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, unless the Taliban, now the government of Afghanistan, also releases Mahmood. An NSC spokesman declined to respond to a CBS inquiry about that specific claim.",
      "Mahmood Habibi disappeared in Afghanistan in 2022, and the Taliban denied abducting him. In a public notice posted by the FBI in August 2024, the agency said it \"believed\" that Habibi was taken by Taliban military or security forces and \"has not been heard from since his disappearance.\" The FBI said in its notice that Habibi was working as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecom company when he disappeared.",
      "The Taliban still say they do not have Habibi in custody.",
      "\"No, we don't have him,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News Monday.",
      "Asked whether Mahmoud had disappeared in Afghanistan, Mujahid said, \"It's not clear either, because we didn't know him before.\"",
      "Ahmad Habibi told CBS News, \"My family has every confidence that my brother is alive. There are things that neither we nor the U.S. government can say publicly, but Mahmood's case is different from the other two Americans.\"",
      "\"We know the other families are desperate to get their loved ones home and I told the president we want them home, too,\" Ahmad Habibi added. \"But anyone speculating that my brother is dead is just feeding into Taliban claims. We are grateful that President Biden committed to not leave Mahmood behind,\" and he said that national security adviser Jake Sullivan had also made similar assurances.",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "Corbett, who is fluent in Pashto, was working for local nongovernmental organizations before starting a microloan and consulting business in Kabul when he was arrested with three associates \u2014 one German and two Afghans \u2014 during a business trip to northern Afghanistan in 2022.",
      "Glezmann is an Atlanta native who was detained while on a tourist visit in December 2022.",
      "The family of Ryan Corbett is publicly calling on Mr. Biden to consider a deal to bring him and Glezmann home.",
      "\"We hope that President Biden will have the courage to take the deal in front of him, given that the lives of several Americans rest on his shoulders,\" Erin Pelton, a spokesperson for the Corbett family, told CBS News.",
      "Corbett's wife, Anna Corbett, described the call with the president during an appearance on Fox News on Monday.",
      "\"He was very kind and empathetic, but what I heard him say is he's not bringing Ryan home, and that was just devastating,\" Anna Corbett said. She blasted Mr. Biden for refusing to agree to the Taliban's terms for a deal. \"It is not being taken and it is incredibly crushing to our family.\"",
      "She has launched a public campaign in recent days to urge the incoming administration to press for her husband's release, and she traveled to President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago residence in hopes of making an in-person plea to Trump. Neither Mr. Biden nor Trump have met with her yet.",
      "Anna Corbett did tell Fox News that Trump sent incoming national security adviser and current Florida Rep. Mike Waltz to meet with her. She said he spent more than an hour listening to her family's story. She expressed frustration that it took more than a year to get a similar meeting with the current national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.",
      "The Taliban have been demanding that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, who is being held in indefinite law-of-war detention at Guantanamo Bay. A source familiar with his case said the U.S. intelligence community and Pentagon oppose Rahim's release and could not guarantee that he no longer represented a threat to the U.S. However, the president could waive that if he determined it were in the U.S. interest to finalize a prisoner swap.",
      "Rahim was captured in Pakistan in 2007 by the CIA and was the last detainee sent to the Guantanamo prison facility by the Bush administration in 2008. He has never been charged with war crimes, but the periodic review board has deemed his continued detention a national security necessity. His 2016 intelligence profile describes him as a courier for al Qaeda.",
      "In its statement acknowledging the phone call, the White House also noted that Mr. Biden had been able to bring home U.S. citizens who had been detained before the U.S. exit from Afghanistan in 2021. Corbett, Glezmann and Habibi were detained after traveling to Afghanistan following the Taliban's return to power. That ascendance of the Taliban followed a diplomatic deal negotiated by the Trump administration for U.S. troops to withdraw and a surprisingly strong Taliban military offensive that caught the Biden administration off guard, leading to a hasty and chaotic U.S. evacuation. Unwilling to remain without U.S. troops, NATO forces also pulled out.",
      "The U.S. does not officially recognize the Taliban, with its horrific human rights record, as the legitimate government of Afghanistan but has been in contact with its leaders through U.S. agencies as well as via the Qatari government. Last weekend in Doha, Special Presidential Envoy Roger Carstens and NSC official Jen Daskal pressed for a deal with the Taliban to free the Americans.",
      "A U.S. official described the Doha meetings as unsuccessful but declined to detail which other individuals the Biden administration was willing to offer to the Taliban as part of a potential trade. The White House described the Biden efforts as continuing through the end of his term.",
      "Mr. Biden has dedicated much of his career to foreign policy, and that portion of his legacy is extremely important to him. In a speech Monday at the State Department, the president will describe the chaotic U.S. exit from Afghanistan, arguably his biggest foreign policy failure, as having successfully ended America's longest war.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 16:34:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect talks for more than a year aimed at ending the war in Gaza and returning the hostages to Israel.",
    "story": [
      "Officials in the U.S. and Israel said that Israel and Hamas were close to agreeing a ceasefire and hostage release deal on Monday, after midnight \"breakthrough\" negotiations.",
      "Qatar, which has been mediating, reportedly gave both Israel and Hamas a draft on Monday of a ceasefire agreement to end the war in Gaza, the Reuters news agency reported, citing an official familiar with the talks.",
      "\"I think the pressure is building for Hamas to come to yes, and I think Israel also has achieved a huge amount of its military objectives in Gaza, and therefore, they are in a position to be able to say 'yes,'\" U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.",
      "Sullivan said Israel and Hamas had been close to a deal before, and things had fallen through, but on Monday there was a \"general sense that this is moving in the right direction.\"",
      "\"The question is now, can we all collectively seize the moment and make this happen?\" Sullivan said.",
      "\"We are in advanced stages of negotiations,\" an Israeli political source told CBS News, saying a deal could be agreed in hours or days. \"There is progress in all components of the agreement formula.\"",
      "What has been happening with the Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks?",
      "Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect talks for more than a year aimed at ending the war in Gaza and returning scores of hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "The Biden administration has been pushing for a deal before the end of his term and Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. On Sunday, President Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone about the ongoing negotiations. The White House said the two leaders discussed the deal based on the arrangement outlined by Mr. Biden last year.",
      "The deal presented to Israel and Hamas appears similar to that arrangement, according to a draft ffrom mediator sources seen by CBS News and a senior Israeli official.",
      "The draft lays out three phases, according to the copy viewed by CBS News, each one to be negotiated as things progress.",
      "During the first phase, which would take place over a 42 days ceasefire period, Hamas would release 33 women and children hostages, as well as hostages over 50 years old. For each woman or child hostage returned to Israel, Israel would release 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older.",
      "On the first day of that ceasefire, Hamas would release 3 hostages, according to the document viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release 4 hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release 3 hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said. International aid groups and the United Nations would resume operation in Gaza, and reconstruction of its infrastructure, like water, electricity and sewage systems, would begin. There would also be negotiations over the next phase of the deal.",
      "The second phase of the deal would involve the release of all the Israeli male hostages and the withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza, according to the document viewed by CBS News.",
      "The third phase, which would be partially negotiated during earlier phases, would include the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and prisoners, the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza, and the opening of its borders.",
      "Despite intense mediation by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, the talks have repeatedly stalled over several key issues including the details of the exchange, whether the ceasefire would be permanent and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "As each side has accused the other of backtracking, the war has ground on.",
      "Dozens of Palestinians have been killed each day in Israeli strikes, and most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are huddled in squalid tent camps, their neighborhoods in ruins. Humanitarian groups struggle to deliver desperately needed aid, and experts have warned of famine.",
      "In Israel, families of the hostages have held weekly rallies demanding a deal for their release, fearing their loved ones will die in the harsh conditions of their captivity the longer the fighting drags on.",
      "What have the main points of contention been in coming up with a ceasefire deal?",
      "Hamas and other groups are still holding around 100 hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel that ignited the war, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. The Israeli military has declared a third of the hostages dead but suspects that the true number could be around half.",
      "Hamas is demanding the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants convicted of orchestrating attacks that killed civilians. Israel is reluctant to free such prisoners, especially since one of the masterminds of the 2023 attack, the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israel in October, was a former prisoner released in such a deal.",
      "The two sides have exchanged lists of names, with Israel demanding more information about which hostages are alive to ensure they come out first.",
      "Hamas has said it won't release the remaining hostages without assurances that the war will end. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 46,000 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities, who don't say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "Hamas likely fears that Israel will resume its offensive \u2014 and step up its intensity \u2014 once the hostages are out and the militants no longer have their most valuable bargaining chip.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to do just that. He has said Israel won't end the war until it has destroyed Hamas' military and governing abilities and ensured that the Palestinian militant group no longer poses a threat.",
      "The lack of trust goes both ways: Israelis fear that Hamas will drag out negotiations over the second phase of the deal, extending the ceasefire indefinitely while the hostages languish.",
      "Talks have almost collapsed over disagreements",
      "The talks nearly collapsed last summer when Netanyahu said Israel would maintain a lasting presence in the Philadelphi corridor, a strip of land along the Gaza-Egypt border.",
      "Israel says Hamas has long smuggled weapons into Gaza through tunnels beneath the corridor and that it must control the area to prevent Hamas from rebuilding. Egypt, a key mediator, says it blocked the tunnels years ago and is opposed to any Israeli presence on the Gaza side of its border.",
      "Israel has also demanded a mechanism for inspecting people returning to their homes in northern Gaza, from which around a million people fled following Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war. Their return is a key Hamas demand, the details of which are still being worked out.",
      "Israel says people returning to the north should be searched for weapons. That would probably require an Israeli presence in what's known as the Netzarim corridor, a strip of closed roads and military installations stretching from the border to the sea just south of Gaza City.",
      "The Palestinians are opposed to any permanent Israeli occupation, though Hamas has reportedly shown flexibility on the timetable of the Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Israel says Hamas can never again rule Gaza but has yet to endorse a realistic plan for an alternative government. With no internal rivals, Hamas has been able to quickly regroup after Israeli operations, even in the hardest-hit areas, and still controls much of the territory.",
      "The Biden administration has long pushed for a grand bargain in which a reformed Palestinian Authority would govern postwar Gaza with the support of Arab and Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, which would also take the historic step of forging ties with Israel.",
      "But Arab and Muslim leaders say they will only sign onto such plans if they include a pathway to a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem and Gaza, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Israel's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood and has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. Netanyahu says Israel will maintain open-ended security control while delegating governance to politically independent Palestinians. But none appear to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened anyone who cooperates with Israel in running the territory.",
      "Hamas has said, however, that it's willing to relinquish control of Gaza to other Palestinians. Late last year, it agreed to an Egyptian-brokered plan for a group of independents to govern the territory under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority, which has yet to accept the proposal.",
      "Hamas has also demanded the lifting of a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after it seized power in 2007, which experts say is needed for Gaza to be rebuilt.",
      "The lifting of the blockade, however, would allow Hamas to claim a major victory and to eventually rebuild its military capabilities. That's another nonstarter for Israel.",

      "Tsunami advisories were issued for Miyazaki prefecture, where the quake was centered, in the southwestern island of Kyushu, as well as nearby Kochi prefecture in Shikoku island, shortly after the quake struck at 9:19 p.m. according to the agency. They were all called off shortly before midnight.",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey\u00a0revised its estimate\u00a0down from 6.9, adding that \"there is no tsunami threat from this earthquake\" for the United States.",

      "The quake, centered at a depth of 18.6 miles, shook a wide area in Kyushu, the southwestern main island, Japan's Meteorological Agency said.",
      "NHK TV footage showed moving traffic and well-lit streets, meaning that electric power was still working. No problems were detected at the various monitoring posts for nuclear plants in the area.",
      "Japan is frequently hit by earthquakes due to its location along the \"Ring of Fire,\" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.",

      "A Nankai Trough quake off Shikoku in 1946 killed more than 1,300 people.",

    "story": [
      "A descendant of one of Jack the Ripper's victims has demanded a new inquest into one of history's most notorious serial killers, after DNA evidence suggested the murderer was a Polish barber.",
      "The true identity of Jack the Ripper, whose grisly murders terrorized the murky slums of Whitechapel in east London in 1888, has been a mystery ever since.",
      "There have been dozens of suspects, from royalty and prime ministers down to bootmakers.",
      "After extracting DNA from a shawl recovered from the scene of one of the killings, Jack the Ripper sleuth Russell Edwards claimed in 2014 that the murderer was Aaron Kosminski, an emigre from Poland, who worked as a barber.",
      "The story goes that the shawl came from the murder scene of the Ripper's fourth victim, Catherine Eddowes, on September 30, 1888.",

      "They were matched with the DNA of Karen Miller, a direct descendant of Eddowes, confirming her blood was on the shawl.",
      "\"On the testing, the first result showed a 99.2% match. Since the DNA has two complementary strands, we went on and tested the other DNA strand, which game a perfect 100% match,\" Louhelainen told\u00a0the Liverpool Echo\u00a0newspaper.",
      "DNA from semen stains on the garment were matched with a descendant of Kosminski.",

      "Kosminski's descendants have also supported the inquest, the Daily Mail reported. According to the newspaper, Kosminski's great-great-great-niece Amanda Poulos said: \"I'm more than happy to finally establish what really happened.\"",
      "Some have cast doubt on Edwards' findings.",
      "The research has not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, meaning the claims cannot be independently verified or the methodology scrutinized.",

      "His family fled the imperial Russian anti-Jewish pogroms and emigrated to east London in the early 1880s. He lived close to the murder scenes.",
      "Some reports say he was taken in by the police to be identified by a witness who had seen him with one of the victims.",
      "Although a positive identification was made, the witness refused to give incriminating evidence, meaning the police had little option but to release Kosminski.",
      "He entered a workhouse in 1889, where he was described on admission as \"destitute.\" He was discharged later that year but soon ended up in a mental asylum.",
      "He died from gangrene in an asylum on March 24, 1919, and was buried three days later at East Ham Cemetery in east London.",
      "As CBS News previously reported, former FBI agent John Douglas referred to the homicides as \"lust murders,\" which means the killer attacked the genital areas of his victims. In Douglas' opinion, this was a way to act out his fantasy of domination, cruelty and mutilation of women.",

    "story": [
      "Dr. Nicole Saphier joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the surgeon general pushing for cancer warning labels on alcohol and the CDC warning of norovirus cases surging in parts of the U.S.",
      "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy warned in a recent advisory about alcohol use increasing cancer risk.",
      "The advisory notes that alcohol can increase the risk of throat, liver, esophageal, mouth, larynx (voice box), colon and rectal cancers, making it the \"third leading preventable cause of cancer\" in the U.S.",
      "This guidance follows the rise of the \"sober curious\" trend, with younger generations scaling back on how much they drink or choosing not to partake at all.",
      "ALCOHOL LINKED TO CANCER RISK IN US SURGEON GENERAL'S NEW ADVISORY",
      "For those who are interested in curbing their alcohol use, here are six tips on how to do so safely.",
      "The surgeon general's advisory noted that alcohol-related cancer deaths even occurred in some moderate drinkers. (iStock)",
      "1. Analyze your alcohol dependence",
      "Alcohol is \"one of the most serious substances\" when it comes to detoxification, sometimes requiring medical hospitalization to manage withdrawal symptoms, according to Dr. Chris Tuell, clinical director at the Lindner Center of HOPE in Mason, Ohio.",
      "\"If you are one of the 40% of Americans who is trying to stop alcohol use, sometimes it may be necessary to seek counseling services.\"",
      "Tuell, who is also an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, recommended speaking to a primary care physician before discontinuing years of extreme alcohol use.",
      "DOES \u2018DRY JANUARY\u2019 ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH? HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW",
      "Dr. Adi Jaffe, PhD, CEO of addiction recovery platform IGNTD in Los Angeles, noted that in some cases, it may be \"medically inadvisable to just quit\" if alcohol dependence is severe.",
      "People who drink heavily, or consume five to seven drinks a day, should consult their doctor before quitting, one addiction specialist recommended. (iStock)",
      "\"You must consult with a medical professional before stopping,\" said Jaffe, author of the book \"Unhooked.\" \"This is especially true if you get tremors, shaking or sweatiness when you don't drink, even for a day or two.\"",
      "\"Those are markers of somebody who's more likely to have a grand mal seizure if they just stop cold turkey.\"",
      "2. Set clear goals and track patterns",
      "For people who haven\u2019t had a \"necessarily problematic\" relationship with alcohol and are just looking to cut back, Tuell recommended setting clear goals to get there.",
      "DRINKING ALCOHOL IS LINKED TO CANCER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"With any behaviors that you plan to change, what are clear, realistic and specific goals on how much or how often you plan to drink?\" he asked.",
      "\"Perhaps you have the goal of only drinking on weekends, or perhaps you limit the amount of alcohol to two drinks per occasion.\"",
      "Writing down your drinking behaviors can help identify triggers, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Tuell suggested tracking your drinking by keeping a journal of when, where and how much you drink.",
      "\"This helps to identify patterns or triggers that may be associated with your mood, such as work stress or family stress and anxieties,\" he said.",
      "Planning alcohol-free days and then gradually increasing the number of those days each week can be effective, the expert added.",
      "3. Avoid triggers and find alternatives",
      "After tracking when, where and how much you drink, it may become clear what triggers you to drink.",
      "Tuell encouraged identifying these situations, emotions and behaviors and finding alternative ways to handle them.",
      "\u2018ALCOHOL GENE\u2019 COULD PREDICT HOW COCKTAILS MAY AFFECT YOU \u2014 AND THERE\u2019S A TEST FOR IT",
      "\"These triggers will frequently lead to behaviors that give us relief and/or a reward, and many times it is not a healthy way of coping,\" he said.",
      "\"Choose non-alcoholic beverages in social settings \u2026 like sparkling water, mocktails or herbal teas, to satisfy the habit of having a drink \u2026 or avoid places where heavy drinking occurs.\"",
      "Social pressure to drink can pose a major temptation, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Jaffe commented that focusing on less drinking won\u2019t be as effective as drinking something else, like a non-alcoholic drink, or doing a different activity instead.",
      "SEVERE HEALTH RISKS OF VAPING AND E-CIGARETTES, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUTH, SAY EXPERTS",
      "Tuell agreed that finding a healthier alternative to bad behaviors is a good way to stop them.",
      "This could include stress-relieving practices like exercising, reading, journaling or spending more time with supportive friends.",
      "Adding movement as a replacement for drinking can help curb bad habits. (iStock)",
      "Movement, mindfulness exercises and meditation can also be helpful practices throughout the day, according to Jaffe.",
      "\"You can do those practices while you're brushing your teeth or while you're making your coffee,\" he said. \"Meditation practices as short as five or 10 minutes can have an incredible impact on your stress response in life.\"",
      "4. Change your environment",
      "Removing temptations from your environment is a good way to prevent reaching for them, according to experts.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Tuell suggested removing alcohol from your home or limiting activities that make it more accessible, such as hanging out at bars.",
      "\"Smell is the strongest of the five senses connected to memory,\" he added.",
      "Jaffe agreed that environment \"plays a massive role\" in how people interact with alcohol.",
      "\"If you're looking to reduce your drinking \u2026 having other people who are participating in the journey with you will go a long way toward helping you meet your goals of reduction.\"",
      "5. Practice saying \u2018no\u2019 and surround yourself with support",
      "The social pressures of drinking can be a trigger, but learning to say \"no\" is powerful. Tuell recommended being prepared with a \"polite but firm\" response in situations where you might feel pressured to drink.",
      "\u2018I\u2019M A PSYCHOLOGIST \u2013 HERE'S HOW TO FINALLY BREAK YOUR BAD HABITS'",
      "This can be as simple as, \"No, thanks, I\u2019m taking a break from drinking\" or \"I\u2019m good, thanks.\"",
      "Tuell advises surrounding yourself with supportive individuals, like trusted friends or family members with whom you can share your goals.",
      "Experts recommend surrounding yourself with supportive individuals with whom you can share your goals. (iStock)",
      "He also suggested joining a support group, \"like Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery, Celebrate Recovery or Women for Sobriety.\"",
      "\"If you are one of the 40% of Americans who is trying to stop alcohol use, sometimes it may be necessary to seek counseling services.\"",
      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0foxnews.com/health",
      "Tuell also mentioned that methods like cognitive behavioral therapy can be effective.",
      "6. Be kind to yourself",
      "Reflecting on the reasons you're looking to reduce alcohol intake \u2014 whether it's to improve your health, save money, strengthen relationships or another motivating factor \u2014 can help keep you on the right path, according to Tuell.",
      "\"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "He also encouraged celebrating milestones by enjoying something non-alcohol-related, such as a massage, a round of golf, a shopping trip or another fun outing.",
      "\"To make changes, it takes time,\" Tuell said. \"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "\"If you keep moving forward one step at a time, you will get to a point where you're drinking substantially less.\" (iStock)",
      "While about 40% of people quit their New Year\u2019s resolutions before the end of January, according to Jaffe, the specialist said it's important to not be discouraged by slip-ups.",

      "\"We believe the state has a responsibility to act quickly on issues that matter most to Tennesseans, and there is widespread support in the General Assembly and across Tennessee for a special session on the most pressing legislative priorities: the unified Education Freedom Act and a comprehensive relief package for Hurricane Helene and other disaster recovery efforts,\" they said. \"The majority of Tennesseans, regardless of political affiliation, have made it clear that they support empowering parents with school choice, and the best thing we can do for Tennessee students is deliver choices and public school resources without delay.\"",
      "The statement added: \"Hurricane Helene was an unprecedented disaster across rural, at-risk, and distressed communities that cannot shoulder the local cost share of federal relief funds on their own. The state has an opportunity and obligation to partner with these impacted counties and develop innovative solutions for natural disasters going forward.\"",

      "\"President Trump has made it clear that states will play a major role in partnering with his Administration to make our communities safer. Tennessee is heeding the call,\" she added.",

Lee told Fox News Digital that he agreed with Trump's promise to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, echoing the president-elect's concern over the federal bureaucracy becoming entrenched with gender and race ideology rather than learning.",

The first 10,000 scholarships would be set aside for low-income students whose parents might not otherwise afford to send their children to institutions other than the public schools in their districts.",
      "In addition to establishing Education Freedom Scholarships, Lee's office said the bill \"further invests in public schools and teachers by delivering teacher bonuses to recognize their unwavering commitment to student success, increasing K-12 facilities funding, and ensuring state funding to school districts will never decrease due to disenrollment.\" The governor and the General Assembly \"will maintain their commitment to public schools by further investing hundreds of millions of state dollars in the Tennessee Investment in Student Achievement (TISA) formula, and raising starting teacher pay,\" Lee's office said.",

Kennedy Jr.'s chief of staff, a new report indicated Monday.",
      "Heather Flick, a lawyer who previously served in multiple top roles at the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department during the first Trump administration, has been working closely with Kennedy over the last few weeks as an informal chief of staff, according to Politico. The outlet added Monday that she had been tapped by Trump's transition team to fill the role permanently, according to four sources familiar. The announcement has yet to be made public.",

      "Flick's selection to work in Trump's second administration is just the latest pick among a list of Trump loyalists who have been given jobs in the administration during his second term. When Flick first joined the Trump administration, she was HHS' acting general counsel before becoming its acting secretary for administration and then eventually a senior adviser to then-HHS Secretary Alex Azar.",

      "The potential HHS secretary has been taking meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill recently in an attempt to shore up support. Democrats and Republicans have both been very critical of the HHS secretary-nominee's opinions about vaccines, while Republicans have also been probing Kennedy during meetings about his past pro-choice views on abortion.",

      "Critics of Kennedy have questioned his ability to handle major crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and posited that Kennedy pushes conspiracy theories about things like vaccines and antidepressants. Meanwhile, business leaders have suggested there is reason to worry as well, on account of past claims Kennedy has made about the dangers of food additives, pesticides and vaccines.",
      "Flick will be tasked with helping Kennedy clean up some of those criticisms.

      "President Biden\u2019s 11th-hour executive action banning new drilling and further oil and natural gas development in coastal waters in the name of protecting the environment could end up causing harm to the environment, according to experts who spoke to Fox News Digital.",
      "Earlier this month, Biden announced the ban will affect\u00a0more than 625 million acres of U.S. coastal and offshore waters while invoking the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which could mean President-elect Donald Trump will be limited in his ability to revoke the action without Congress.",
      "Biden\u00a0released a statement\u00a0defending his action, arguing that the \"relatively minimal fossil fuel potential in the areas I am withdrawing do not justify the environmental, public health, and economic risks that would come from new leasing and drilling.\"",

      "Hoffman pointed to, among other concerns, the Land & Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which is funded in large part by $900 million in royalties from oil and gas companies.",
      "\"It was a simple idea: use revenues from the depletion of one natural resource - offshore oil and gas - to support the conservation of another precious resource - our land and water,\" the fund\u2019s\u00a0website states. That fund will presumably lose out on those royalties as a result of Biden\u2019s decision, Hoffman warned.",

The president completely ignores the fact that the Land and Water Conservation Fund is exclusively funded by offshore oil and natural gas leasing and production,\" Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Alliance, said in the press release.",
      "\"Nearly every community nationwide has a park or outdoor recreation facility that has received funding from the LWCF. National parks that have struggled with dilapidation and damages from overcrowding similarly benefit from offshore revenues. These funds help protect water ways, support wildlife, and build trails and playgrounds. President Biden put the future of these projects at risk with his Executive Order.\"",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, who oversees the LWCF, said, \"There would be no effect to any existing leases (or royalties derived from them for the U.S. treasury), nor the LWCF.\"",
      "The spokesperson added, \"The Central and Western Gulf, where funding from LCWF comes from, is not impacted by the President\u2019s withdrawal.\"",
      "Hoffman told Fox News Digital that Biden's directive, \"won't impact LWCF in the short-term, with Trump-era leasing grandfathered in, the long-term impact could put $2.8B of conservation funding- including $900M from offshore royalties - at risk.\"",
      "Additionally, cutting oil drilling in the United States is likely to drive the United States to become more dependent on foreign sources of oil, often in countries with less environmental protections than those that exist in the United States.",

Security researchers have discovered a new variant of stealer malware that targets browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets and other personal data.

At that time, it was available for as much as $3,000 per month.",
      "Check Point says this malware evolved in September after being exposed. This time, its developers had \"stolen\" a string encryption algorithm from Apple\u2019s own XProtect antivirus engine, which replaced the plain text strings used in the original version. Since antivirus programs expect to see this kind of encryption from Apple\u2019s legitimate security tools, they weren\u2019t flagged as suspicious, allowing the BanShee to remain undetected and quietly steal data from targeted devices.",

It goes after data from browsers like Chrome, Brave, Edge and Vivaldi, as well as cryptocurrency wallet extensions. It even takes advantage of two-factor authentication (2FA) extensions to grab credentials. On top of that, it collects details about the device\u2019s software and hardware, as well as the external IP address.",
      "The Mac malware also tricks users with fake pop-ups that look like real system prompts, tricking victims into entering their macOS passwords. Once it has gathered the stolen information, BanShee exfiltrates it to command-and-control servers, using encrypted and encoded files to ensure the data remains secure.",
      "The malware\u2019s creators used GitHub repositories to spread BanShee. They set up fake repositories that looked like they hosted popular software, complete with stars and reviews, to seem trustworthy. These campaigns didn\u2019t just target macOS users with BanShee.

      "5 tips to protect yourself from Mac malware",
      "Follow these essential tips to safeguard your Mac from the latest malware threats, including the notorious BanShee Stealer.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links. Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3)\u00a0Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4)\u00a0Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5)\u00a0Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "No device is immune to cyberattacks when a human operator is involved. Take the BanShee Stealer, for example. It managed to target Macs not due to weak cybersecurity measures by Apple but because it successfully tricked users into installing it and granting the required permissions. Most breaches, hacks and other cyberattacks stem from human error. This highlights the importance of maintaining basic cybersecurity hygiene. It's crucial to know what you\u2019re downloading, ensure it\u2019s from a trusted source and carefully review the permissions you grant to any online service or application.",

    "story": [
      "When we talk about data privacy, tech giants like Google and Facebook are often blamed for using personal data to show ads and recommendations. Less discussed are the businesses whose entire business model revolves around collecting your data and selling it to other companies and governments. These companies often operate in legal gray areas, with the consent required to collect user data buried deep in the fine print.",
      "What\u2019s even more concerning is that these data brokers fail to adequately protect the data they collect. Last year, National Public Data made headlines for\u00a0failing to secure 2.7 billion records of individuals whose data it had harvested. Now, hackers have reportedly stolen data from Gravy Analytics, the parent company of Venntel, which has sold vast amounts of smartphone location data to the U.S. government.",

The compromise is massive, including sensitive location data that tracks precise smartphone movements, customer information and even internal infrastructure, according to a\u00a0404 Media report.",

      "Hackers have claimed access to Gravy's systems since 2018. If true, this represents a serious security lapse on the company\u2019s part. It is baffling how companies that collect and sell user data (a practice that arguably shouldn\u2019t be allowed in the first place) failed to protect it from being leaked.",
      "404 Media also suggests that the hackers gained deep access to the company\u2019s infrastructure, including Amazon S3 buckets and server root access.

      "This data breach highlights the serious security flaws in the location data industry. Companies like Gravy Analytics and Venntel have been profiting from collecting and selling sensitive location data, often without proper user consent. They've prioritized profit over security, and now the privacy of millions is at risk. This data could end up on black markets, endangering individuals, especially those in vulnerable situations, by making them targets for harassment or worse.",
      "The FTC's recent crackdown on Gravy, announced in December, underscores their negligence. The proposed order will prohibit these companies from selling or using location data, except in specific cases like national security or law enforcement. The implications are worrying.

      "1) Limit app permissions: Many apps request access to location data, contacts and more, even when it's not necessary for their functionality. Regularly review the permissions for apps on your smartphone and revoke access to anything that feels excessive. For instance, a weather app doesn\u2019t need access to your microphone or camera.",
      "2) Use a VPN:\u00a0Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your IP address and encrypt your internet activity, making it harder for data brokers and hackers to track your online behavior. A good VPN adds an extra layer of security, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Opt out of data sharing where possible:\u00a0Some companies allow you to opt out of having your data collected or shared. Services like Your Ad Choices and privacy settings within platforms like Google can help you reduce the amount of data collected. Check for opt-out options with any apps or services you use frequently.",
      "4)\u00a0Avoid free apps that monetize data: Free apps often generate revenue by selling user data. Instead, consider paid versions of apps that explicitly prioritize privacy. Research the company behind the app to understand its data handling policies before downloading.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0Data removal services can help you regain some control over your personal information by identifying and removing it from people-search websites, data broker platforms and other online databases.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Companies that collect and sell user data pose a significant threat to privacy, and when they fail to protect this data, it often ends up in the hands of even worse actors. Cybercriminals, and even some governments, can exploit this information to target individuals. It is crucial to implement stringent repercussions for these companies when they fail in their duty to safeguard user data. A mere slap on the wrist is not enough.

      "I always stress the importance of using a password manager to store your passwords. Let\u2019s be honest, we all have a ton of apps and services that require an account and password. If you use the same password everywhere, you risk having your important info stolen by cybercriminals. But it\u2019s also impossible to come up with a unique password for every app and remember them all.",
      "Password managers make life easier by storing your passwords and filling them in when you log into apps. But they usually charge a monthly or yearly fee. That\u2019s where Apple\u2019s Passwords app comes in. It works just like a password manager but without the extra cost. Open the app from the App Library, and it\u2019ll keep your login details encrypted and synced across all your devices.",
      "While Apple's new Passwords app in iOS 18 offers a convenient and cost-free solution for password management, it's important to consider its limitations. These include its exclusivity to the Apple ecosystem, lack of compatibility with Android or Linux devices and limited functionality outside of Safari and Apple apps. For those seeking a more comprehensive password management solution that works across various browsers and apps, check out my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "German automaker Volkswagen isn't having a great time. The company is planning to cut capacity at five factories, reducing production by about 700,000 vehicles, while also laying off more than 35,000 workers in its home country. Now, reports suggest the company had a massive data leak at its subsidiary software company Cariad, which exposed personal data, including geolocation data, of around 800,000 EV owners online and accessible for months. Such information could be valuable to criminals for extortion purposes. What's interesting is that a hacker association informed the company about this data leak after receiving a tip from an anonymous hacker.",

      "What you need to know about the data leak",
      "As reported by Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel magazine, Volkswagen is facing a major data security issue after movement data from 800,000 electric cars and the personal contact information of their owners were left exposed on the internet. This data revealed sensitive details, such as the precise locations where cars were parked, including private locations like people\u2019s homes, government buildings and even questionable spots like brothels.",
      "The exposed data includes detailed movement patterns of these vehicles, allowing for the creation of comprehensive profiles of individuals' daily activities. This could be particularly concerning for public figures or anyone with privacy concerns.",
      "Several car brands under the Volkswagen group, including VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda, were affected by the breach, which exposed sensitive data across multiple countries. The information was stored on Amazon cloud servers without adequate protection, leaving it vulnerable for months before the issue was discovered.",
      "For around 466,000 of the 800,000 affected vehicles, the location data was detailed enough to map out drivers\u2019 daily routines. Spiegel reported that the list of affected users included German politicians, business leaders, the entire EV fleet used by Hamburg police and even suspected intelligence agents.",
      "The breach came to light when an anonymous hacker tipped off the Chaos Computer Club. While Volkswagen left the data easily accessible during this time, there is no indication so far that anyone misused or accessed it maliciously.",
      "We reached out to Volkswagen for comment but did not hear back by our deadline.",

      "How can this data leak affect you?",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is more than just a tech issue. It is a real concern for anyone who values their privacy. With precise location data out in the open, someone could figure out where you live, work or spend your free time. This information could be misused in many ways, from targeted scams where hackers pretend to be Volkswagen or its partners to trick you into giving up sensitive information, to more personal threats like stalking or harassment.",
      "Imagine someone knowing your daily routine or identifying places you visit that you would prefer to keep private. Visits to clinics, legal offices or other sensitive locations could expose you to embarrassment or blackmail.",
      "The breach also raises concerns for business leaders, government officials and military personnel as their movements linked to high-security or restricted areas could be exposed, increasing the risk of corporate espionage or national security threats. Moreover, when paired with other vulnerabilities, such as app credentials, hackers could potentially exploit the data to unlock or even control vehicles remotely.",

      "In light of the recent Volkswagen data breach, it is crucial to take proactive measures to safeguard your personal data. Here are 6 ways you can stay safe after this leak:",
      "1) Check your app settings:\u00a0Review the permissions and data-sharing settings in your car's companion app. Disable features that track or share your location if they are not essential for your use. Regularly update the app to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "2) Be alert to scams:\u00a0Keep an eye out for suspicious emails, messages or calls pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. Avoid clicking on links or sharing sensitive information without verifying the sender.",
      "3) Consider data opt-out options:\u00a0Many vehicles with online features allow you to limit or disable certain data-sharing functionalities. Check your car\u2019s settings to reduce the amount of personal data being collected.",
      "4) Strengthen your online accounts:\u00a0If you use the same email or password across multiple accounts, update them immediately. Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "5) Beware of snail mail scams: While most people focus on digital threats, physical mail scams can also follow a data breach like this. If your contact information was exposed, you might receive fraudulent letters pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. These could ask for payments, personal details or even encourage you to visit fake websites.",
      "6) Install strong antivirus software: Ensure that you have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices, especially those connected to your vehicle or its apps. This can help protect you from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is a glaring example of how companies need to take user data security more seriously. Exposing personal details and precise locations is not just a technical mistake. It is a massive breach of trust. While VW has patched the issue, the damage shows how important it is for businesses to be more responsible with the data they collect. People deserve to know their information is safe and used only when necessary. If companies cannot protect their customers\u2019 privacy, they risk losing their confidence altogether. It is time for the industry to step up and do better.",

      "As reported by\u00a0threat management company Cyfirma, FireScam is a type of malware that targets Android devices to steal personal information. It works like spyware, keeping an eye on what you do on your Android phone, such as reading your notifications, messages, clipboard content and more.",
      "Hackers are spreading FireScam by pretending it\u2019s a premium version of Telegram. They\u2019ve created a fake website on GitHub that looks like RuStore (a real app store in Russia). When people visit this fake site, they\u2019re tricked into downloading an app that looks like \"Telegram Premium.\" However, this app is actually a trap. Once installed, it downloads the FireScam malware onto your device and starts stealing your personal data.",
      "To avoid detection, the app is heavily disguised using a tool called DexGuard. It asks for permissions to access your storage, check installed apps and install more software. When you open the app, it shows a fake login page that looks like Telegram\u2019s. If you enter your details, it steals your credentials.",
      "The stolen data is first stored in a Firebase Realtime Database, but hackers later move it to private servers. The malware also registers each compromised device with a unique ID so hackers can keep track of their victims.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from fake apps",
      "1. Download apps only from official stores:\u00a0Always use trusted app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store to download apps. These platforms have security measures to detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites, pop-up ads or unofficial third-party stores as these are common sources of fake apps.",
      "2. Verify the app\u2019s developer:\u00a0Before installing an app, check who created it. Look at the developer's name and ensure it matches the official company behind the app. Fake apps often copy the names of popular apps but use slightly altered spellings or extra characters. For example, a fake might be called \"PayPaal\" instead of \"PayPal.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Pay attention to reviews and ratings:\u00a0Reviews and ratings can give you insight into an app's authenticity. If an app has mostly negative reviews, very few downloads or generic comments like \"Great app,\" it could be fake. Genuine apps typically have a large number of detailed reviews over time. Be cautious of apps with five-star ratings but no specific feedback.",
      "4. Be cautious of app permissions:\u00a0Check the permissions the app requests before installing. A flashlight app, for example, shouldn\u2019t need access to your contacts or messages. If an app is asking for permissions that don\u2019t align with its purpose, it could be a red flag. Always deny permissions that seem excessive or unnecessary.",
      "5. Keep your phone and apps updated:\u00a0Regular updates for your operating system and apps often include important security fixes that protect your device from malware. Turning on automatic updates can ensure you always have the latest protections.",
      "6. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install strong antivirus software on your Android. These tools can scan apps for malware, detect suspicious activity and block harmful downloads. Strong antivirus software provides an extra layer of defense, especially when browsing or downloading apps. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "The FireScam malware is a powerful tool that can steal everything on your phone, and it\u2019s tough to detect if you're not careful. Such apps can\u2019t be distributed through legitimate app stores like the Play Store or the App Store, so they rely on third-party stores and fake websites to spread. To stay safe, the best approach is to stick to verified app stores and avoid downloading from untrustworthy sources.",

Once the water reaches the surface, it is evaporated by solar-heated plasmonic materials. As the water vapor rises, the salt is left behind, ensuring that only purified water is collected. The vapor then recondenses on a clear plastic dome situated above the device. Finally, the purified water is funneled down the sides of the dome and collected in a sealed bag for easy access.",
      "The results of this process are impressive. In real-world tests conducted in Halifax Harbour, the device produced up to 0.97 gallons of clean water daily, which was a record-breaking yield for passive floating solar stills.",

      "President Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, held a press conference Wednesday announcing that the deal would roll out in three phases.",
      "Biden said the first phase will last six weeks and \"includes a full and complete cease-fire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the populated areas of Gaza, and the release of a number of hostages held by Hamas, including women and elderly and the wounded. And I'm proud to say Americans will be part of that hostage release and phase one as well. And the vice president and I cannot wait to welcome them home,\" he said.",
      "In exchange, Israel released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, Biden said, and Palestinians \"can also return to their neighborhoods in all areas of Gaza, and a surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza will begin.\"",
      "\"During the next six weeks, Israel will negotiate the necessary arrangements to get phase two, which is a permanent end of the war. Let me say that again, a permanent end of the war,\" Biden said. \"There are a number of details to negotiate the move from phase one to phase two. But the plan says if negotiations take longer than six weeks, the cease-fire will continue as long as the negotiations continue.\"",
      "CEASE-FIRE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS GETTING CLOSER AMID CONCERNS TERROR GROUP REARMING IN GAZA\"When phase two begins, there will be an exchange for release of the remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, and all remaining Israeli forces will be withdrawn from Gaza, and the temporary ceasefire will become permanent,\" Biden said. \"And finally, Phase Three: Any final remains of hostages who have been killed will be returned to their families, and a major reconstruction plan for Gaza will begin.\"",

      "Earlier, a source briefed on the matter told Fox News: \"A Gaza cease-fire and hostage release deal was reached following the Qatari Prime Minister's meeting with Hamas negotiators, and separately, Israeli negotiators in his office.\"",
      "Separately, a senior Hamas official confirmed to Fox News that a deal was reached. In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that final details were still unresolved, but that it hoped \"details will be finalized tonight.\"",
      "Reuters also reported that a deal has been reached, citing an official briefed on the agreement.",
      "The conflict, which began with Hamas\u2019 brutal attacks on October 7, 2023, has left over 1,200 Israelis dead, more than 250 taken hostages, and thousands of others killed on both sides.",
      "President-elect Trump, who threatened last week if a deal wasn't struck before his Inauguration Day that \"all hell will break out\" in the Middle East, quickly offered his praise.",
      "\"This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,\" Trump wrote on TRUTH Social. \"I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.\"",
      "The deal, brokered by Qatari negotiators and facilitated by Egyptian intermediaries, also saw significant involvement from the United States. Both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration applied strategic pressure to finalize the agreement, despite concerns about Hamas rearming and internal tensions within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition.",
      "Sources told Fox News Digital that a weekend meeting between Netanyahu and Trump's incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, led to the breakthrough. Witkoff\u2019s assurances reportedly convinced Netanyahu to accept the deal, despite threats from a right-wing party to withdraw from the coalition if it passed.",

      "On Wednesday, Trump praised his negotiators. \"With this deal in place, my National Security team, through the efforts of Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven,\" the president-elect said on TRUTH Social. \"We will continue promoting PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH throughout the region, as we build upon the momentum of this ceasefire to further expand the Historic Abraham Accords. This is only the beginning of great things to come for America, and indeed, the World!\"\"We have achieved so much without even being in the White House,\" Trump added. \"Just imagine all of the wonderful things that will happen when I return to the White House, and my Administration is fully confirmed, so they can secure more Victories for the United States!",
      "The agreement calls for the release of three hostages on the first day, followed by weekly batches. Women, children, and men over 50 will be prioritized initially, with younger men in humanitarian cases included later. Updates on hostages\u2019 statuses will alternate between announcements of survivors and confirmation of those who did not survive captivity.",
      "The operation\u2019s execution relies on extensive coordination among the IDF, Shin Bet, Israeli Police, the Ministry of Health, the International Red Cross, and Egyptian authorities. Over 42 days, 33 Israeli hostages are expected to be released. Early stages will focus on civilian women, children and female soldiers, followed by elderly men. The final hostage in this group is scheduled for release on the 42nd day.",
      "HAMAS HAS ACCEPTED DRAFT AGREEMENT FOR GAZA CEASE-FIRE, HOSTAGE RELEASE: OFFICIALS",
      "On the 16th day, the second phase will begin, addressing the release of younger men, soldiers, and the return of remains. Netanyahu assured hostage families that every captive is accounted for in the deal. Approximately 1,000 Palestinian prisoners will be freed in exchange, with murder convicts barred from returning to the West Bank. Instead, they will be sent to Gaza, Qatar, or Turkey.",
      "The cease-fire will also facilitate significant humanitarian aid to Gaza, with up to 600 trucks of supplies entering daily. By the 22nd day, displaced residents will be allowed to return to northern Gaza. Qatari and Egyptian teams will manage vehicle inspections, while pedestrian crossings will not require checks. The IDF will withdraw from the Nitzarim corridor but maintain a limited presence along the Philadelphi Route.",

      "Although intelligence on the hostages\u2019 conditions remains limited, assessments suggest that most are alive. Before each release stage, Israel will receive updated information on their identities and health statuses. The International Red Cross will oversee their transfer from Gaza to Israel, ensuring their safety while addressing logistical challenges such as crowd control.",
      "Upon entering Israel, hostages will undergo identity verification and initial questioning by Shin Bet and the IDF. Medical teams stationed at the border will provide immediate care, and those requiring further treatment will be airlifted to hospitals. After receiving necessary care, hostages will be reunited with their families.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Months after South African authorities initially cut off supplies to miners working illegally in an abandoned gold mine, rescuers brought dozens of bodies and emaciated survivors to the surface Tuesday with hundreds more still believed to be underground, many of them dead and others too weak to come out on their own.",
      "At least 60 bodies and 92 survivors had been pulled from one of South Africa's deepest mines since Monday in a red cagelike device lowered thousands of feet underground, police said. Police are uncertain how many miners remain inside but said it is likely in the hundreds. Another nine bodies were brought out Friday in a community-led rescue effort, according to a group representing the miners.",
      "DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO 13 IN SOUTH AFRICA MINING DISASTER",
      "The mine has been the scene of a tense standoff between police, miners and members of the local community since authorities launched an operation in November to force the miners out by cutting off food and water from the surface for a period of time. At the time, a Cabinet minister said the aim was to \"smoke them out\" and the government would not send help because they were \"criminals.\"",
      "But that tactic has been fiercely criticized by civic groups and the community, and the South African government is under scrutiny for the way it has dealt with the issue at the Buffelsfontein Gold Mine, where more than 100 miners are believed to have died underground of starvation or dehydration, according to the group representing them.",
      "Rescue workers assist an illegal miner who has been trapped deep in an abandoned gold mine for months, in Stilfontein, South Africa, Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Themba Hadebe)",
      "Authorities, who removed the ropes and pulley system miners used to enter and to lower supplies, say the survivors are able to come out but refuse to because of fear of arrest. That has been disputed by the civic groups, which won a court case to force authorities to allow food, water and medicine to be sent down to the miners. But they say the supplies aren\u2019t enough and many of the miners are dying of starvation and unable to climb out because the shaft is too steep.",
      "Residents desperately waiting for news of family members gathered at the mine Tuesday near the town of Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg, some holding placards criticizing authorities for their response. One sign said there had been a \"Sacrifice at Stilfontein\" while some handcuffed survivors were led away in a line by police.",
      "The community organized its own rescue operation on Friday before the official effort by authorities began Monday. They say a proper rescue operation should have been launched months ago.",
      "\"We are happy that this operation is happening, even though we believe that if it was done earlier, we wouldn\u2019t even have one dead person,\" said Mzukisi Jam, the regional chairperson of the South African National Civics Organization, an umbrella for civic and rights groups.",
      "Authorities have grappled with informal mining for years",
      "Illegal mining is common in parts of gold-rich South Africa where companies close down mines that are no longer profitable, leaving groups of informal miners to enter them illegally in a search for leftover deposits.",
      "Large groups of miners often go underground for months to maximize their profits, taking food, water, generators and other equipment with them, but also relying on others in their group on the surface to send down more supplies.",
      "Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe visited the site Tuesday and said that more than 1,500 miners who resurfaced from the Buffelsfontein mine have been arrested since authorities began a larger crackdown on illegal mining in late 2023. He said the vast majority were foreign nationals from neighboring countries.",
      "Police have also doubled down on their assertion that the miners who are still underground aren't coming out because they are afraid of being arrested.",
      "Activists said the only way out is for miners to make a dangerous trek to another shaft, which can take days, and crawl out there, but many are too weak or ill to climb out. The mine is 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) deep with multiple shafts, many levels and a maze of tunnels. The group representing the miners said there are numerous groups in various parts of the mine.",
      "\"The last time I spoke to my brother was in July, when he told us that he is going underground,\" said Zinzi Tom, a sister of one of the miners who remained underground. \"We had not heard anything from him, but yesterday one of the miners who surfaced said he saw him about two weeks ago. Apparently he is very sick and he is struggling to survive.\"",
      "Cellphone videos emerge from underground",
      "The Mining Affected Communities United in Action group, which took authorities to court in December to force them to allow supplies to be sent down to the miners, released two cellphone videos that they said were from underground and showed dozens of dead bodies of miners wrapped in plastic. A spokesman for the group said \"a minimum\" of 100 miners had died.",
      "The cellphone videos purportedly from the depths of the mine are filmed by a man who can be heard saying, \"This is hunger. People are dying because of hunger,\" as he records emaciated-looking men sitting on the damp floor of the mine. He adds: \"Please help us. Bring us food or take us out.\"",
      "The rescue operation will go on for 10 days and authorities would then reassess, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu said. Police also said that the survivors who had been brought to the surface will be arrested and charged with illegal mining and trespassing after receiving medical attention.",

It\u2019s likely that contractors and supplies will be pushed to the limit, and that\u2019s before they factor in the temporary infrastructure required for the Games.",
      "You\u2019d have to go back more than a century to find another Olympics that was changed because of a natural disaster. Jeremy Fuchs, the author of a 2021 book about the history of the Olympics, pointed to one notable example from almost 120 years ago. Rome had been set to host the 1908 Summer Games. But after the deadly and violent eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906, Italian funds were diverted to support Rome\u2019s recovery.",
      "The 1908 Games were moved to London, though Rome got another chance in the summer of 1960.",

    "title": "Super Scooper planes that fight wildfires are 'rugged, reliable' \u2014 and rare",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 17:31:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Only about 160 fire-dousing Super Scooper aircraft, which are built in Canada using a 55-year-old design, are in operation worldwide as demand for them grows.",
    "story": [
      "One reason last week\u2019s collision between a firefighting plane and a drone caused such a stir was because Los Angeles doesn\u2019t have many spare \u201cSuper Scoopers\u201d to take the aircraft\u2019s place.",
      "The Los Angeles Fire Department typically leases two each year, but authorities have requested more to combat the wildfires that continue to burn throughout the metro area. There are only about 160 in operation around the world, each one constructed by a single Canadian company based on a design that has barely changed in 55 years.",
      "\u201cIt is a rugged, reliable and very tough aircraft,\u201d said Neil Sweeney, vice president of corporate affairs at De Havilland Aircraft, the planes\u2019 manufacturer, which is based in Calgary.",
      "Super Scoopers get their name from their ability to pick up 6,000 liters from bodies of water and drop them in just 12 seconds on wildfires burning nearby, he said. It\u2019s a specialized task that\u2019s becoming more in demand as a warming climate contributes to bigger, hotter, more frequent blazes that are often difficult to control.",
      "Unlike most other firefighting aircraft that must return to base after each drop, Super Scoopers can fly continuously for three to four hours, returning to ingest and release water on a fire repeatedly. Their powerful engines let pilots slow down and execute drops with precision, Sweeney said, and the planes have proved capable of operating in \u201csome of the worst conditions possible,\u201d including high winds.",
      "So losing just one Super Scooper even temporarily can hamper firefighting operations when every hour is critical. Thursday\u2019s drone crash, which punched a hole in the plane\u2019s left wing, was a close call, Sweeney said. The aircraft landed safely and no one was injured, but it could\u2019ve been much worse if the drone had hit elsewhere, he added.",
      "The incident nonetheless grounded the plane for days, keeping it out of action as authorities struggled to respond to shifting winds over the weekend. It was expected to fly again Tuesday, according to Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone, but officials said they\u2019re taking the incident seriously and the FBI is seeking information about the drone\u2019s operator.",
      "The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, meanwhile, has urged people to respect restricted airspace. \u201cThere could have been injuries,\u201d said Scott McLean, an information officer for Cal Fire. \u201cThere could have been fatalities.\u201d",
      "So far, there aren\u2019t many alternatives to Super Scoopers. While tech startups are racing to build bigger, more powerful firefighting drones, most are still under development. Experts say it could take some time before effective, affordable autonomous aircraft are in widespread use, given the logistical hurdles and safety regulations that need to be cleared first.",
      "De Havilland mainly focuses on special-mission aircraft. The company has been making the current Super Scooper model since 2015, when former manufacturer Bombardier sold the program to De Havilland. The company is now working on producing its first order of 22 new Super Scoopers, or the De Havilland Canadair 515, for fire departments in Europe, Sweeney said.",
      "Earlier versions \u2014 the CL-215, produced in the 1970s and \u201980s, and the CL-415, produced from the \u201990s through 2015 \u2014 are still in use as well. Sweeney estimated about 70 of the Super Scoopers currently in action are the older CL-215 model. He expects more fire departments will soon seek replacements as many contend with more intense, longer-lasting fire seasons, and as other places that don\u2019t typically experience wildfires begin to do so.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing significant demand around the world,\u201d Sweeney said, adding that De Havilland hopes to ramp up production to nine or 10 planes each year.",
      "Most Super Scoopers in the U.S. are owned by Montana-based Bridger Aerospace. With six planes, the company holds the largest private Super Scooper fleet in the world and leases the aircraft to fire departments. Over the weekend, Bridger sent a CL-415, which had been undergoing winter maintenance, to California.",
      "Other Super Scoopers operating in the U.S. are on loan from Canada, like the Quebec 1 that was hit by the drone in L.A. Officials there have leased a pair of CL-415 planes from the government of Quebec each fire season for the past 31 years.",
      "That partnership reflects the long history of cross-border resource-sharing for wildfire control, Sweeney said, adding that he hopes it will continue even as the challenges grow.",
      "The incoming U.S. administration could throw a wild card into this arrangement, with President-elect Donald Trump already threatening tariffs of up to 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico. He also suggested this month that he wanted to make Canada the 51st state, adding to diplomatic tensions that factored into a leadership change atop the country\u2019s ruling party.",
      "For now, though, \u201cthere\u2019s a high degree of cooperation worldwide, but especially between North American states and provinces when we have severe wildfires,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cOur American friends send equipment, send personnel up to us, and vice versa.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "It's a con even more elaborate than \"Oceans 11.\"",
      "A French woman who thought she was in a romantic relationship with Hollywood star Brad Pitt handed over 830,000 euros ($855,000) to scammers as part of an elaborate, yearlong con that involved an AI-generated version of the \"Moneyball\" actor.",
      "To add insult to injury, when she discussed her misfortune on the French television channel TF1, the 53-year-old interior designer known only as \"Anne\" was hit with a wave of mockery and trolling so bad that the station had to pull her interview with its \"Seven to Eight\" show.",
      "\u201cThe story broadcast this Sunday has resulted in a wave of harassment against the witness,\u201d TF1 presenter Harry Roselmack posted on his X account Tuesday. \u201cFor the protection of victims, we have decided to withdraw it from our platforms.\u201d",
      "Anne said she began talking to the fake version of the \"Fight Club\" actor sometime in February 2023, after an account posing as Pitt's mother, Jane Etta Pitt, sent her a message on Instagram while she was on a skiing holiday in the French Alps.",
      "Speaking on TF1, Anne said that the account \u201ctold me that her son needed someone like me,\u201d according to AFP.",
      "Over the next few months, she exchanged several messages on different social media and messaging platforms, including WhatsApp, with the fake Pitt, even receiving AI-generated selfies of the 61-year-old actor, whose facsimile told her he needed money for cancer treatment.",
      "\u201cAt first I said to myself that it was fake, that it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not used to social media and I didn\u2019t really understand what was happening to me.\u201d",
      "The request for money came after the scammers told Anne that Pitt was in the hospital with kidney cancer and needed money for the treatment, but that his bank accounts were allegedly frozen because of his divorce proceedings with ex-wife Angelina Jolie.",
      "She was hesitant at first, but eventually transferred the large sum of money to an account in Turkey after receiving an email from the fake star\u2019s \u201cdoctor.\u201d",
      "Anne said she finally realized she had been the victim of a scam after she saw pictures of the real Pitt with his current partner, In\u00e8s de Ramon, last summer. \u201cI ask myself why they chose me to do such harm like this?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never harmed anyone. These people deserve hell.\u201d",
      "The French newspaper\u00a0Sud Ouest reported that Anne was going through divorce proceedings with a millionaire entrepreneur at the time. She reportedly suffered from severe depression and was hospitalized following the scam.",
      "Police are now investigating the con, but the interview has nevertheless sparked a deluge of jokes online.",
      "Among the individuals, organizations and companies making jokes at Anne's expense was Netflix France, which promoted \u201cfour films to see with Brad Pitt (really) for free\u201d in a post on X.",
      "Artificial intelligence has increased the risk of identity theft and  fraud online, which contributed to over $8.8 million in losses in the U.S., according to the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "A global study conducted by the computer security company McAfee found that 1 in 4 people worldwide have either experienced an AI-voice cloning scam or know someone who has."

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 19:18:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The FDA said Wednesday it\u2019s banning the use of Red No. 3, a synthetic dye that has been linked to behavioral problems in children and cancer in animals.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it\u2019s banning the use of Red No. 3, a synthetic dye that gives food and drinks their bright red cherry color but has been linked to cancer in animals.",
      "The dye is still used in thousands of foods, including candy, cereals, cherries in fruit cocktails and strawberry-flavored milkshakes, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a food safety advocacy group that petitioned the agency in 2022 to end its use. More than 9,200 food items contain the dye, including hundreds of products made by large food companies, CSPI said, citing Agriculture Department data.",
      "The FDA\u2019s decision is a victory for consumer advocacy groups and some U.S. lawmakers who have long urged the FDA to revoke the additive\u2019s approval, citing ample evidence that its use in beverages, dietary supplements, cereals and candies may cause cancer as well as affect children\u2019s behavior.",
      "\u201cAt long last, the FDA is ending the regulatory paradox of Red 3 being illegal for use in lipstick, but perfectly legal to feed to children in the form of candy,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the CSPI. The agency banned the additive in cosmetics in 1990 under the Delaney Clause, a federal law that requires the FDA to ban food additives that are found to cause or induce cancer in humans or animals.",
      "Food manufacturers will have until Jan. 15, 2027, to reformulate their products. Companies that make ingested drugs, such as dietary supplements, will get an additional year.",
      "\"The FDA cannot authorize a food additive or color additive if it has been found to cause cancer in human or animals,\" Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy director for human foods, said in a statement. \"Evidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No. 3.\"",
      "What is red dye No. 3?",
      "Red No. 3, approved for use in foods in 1907, is made from petroleum.",
      "The FDA's move to ban the dye has been in the works for decades. The agency first became aware that the additive was possibly carcinogenic following a study in the 1980s that found tumors in male rats who were exposed to it in high doses.",
      "\u201cIt removes an unnecessary hazard from the American food supply, and we welcome that action, even though it should have occurred more than three decades ago,\" Lurie said.",
      "\u201cThis is a big win for consumers, that this cancer-causing chemical is finally going to be out of the food supply. It is long overdue,\u201d said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy health organization that joined the petition to end the use of Red No. 3. \u201cWe are thrilled that the FDA has finally managed to get it over the finish line.\u201d",
      "Benesh added that she was hopeful that federal regulators would take a closer look at other artificial dyes that advocacy groups have long expressed concern over.",
      "\u201cThe FDA, I think, is feeling that pressure from consumers who are worried about what is in their food,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is certainly an important positive step forward.\u201d",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, a trade group, said food safety is \u201cthe number one priority\u201d for companies and that they would comply with the FDA\u2019s ban.",
      "\u201cRevoking the authorized use of Red No. 3 is an example of the FDA using its risk and science-based authority to review the safety of products in the marketplace,\u201d\u00a0senior vice president of product policy and federal affairs Sarah Gallo said in a written statement. \u201cFood and beverage companies will continue to follow the latest science and comply with all food safety regulations to ensure safe and available choices for consumers.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration's move comes before the Senate confirmation hearings for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect-Donald Trump's pick for health and human secretary. Kennedy has said he would make removing artificial dyes from the food supply a focus of the administration.",
      "California as well as 10 other states have already made moves to ban the food dye, according to CSPI. It's also banned or severely restricted in places outside the U.S., including Australia, Japan and countries in the European Union.",
      "Some U.S. food manufacturers have already removed artificial dyes, including Red No. 3, from their products.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the National Confectioners Association, a trade group that promotes chocolate, candy, gum and mints, said it will continue to follow and comply with the FDA's guidance.",
      "\"Our consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework,\" the spokesperson said.\u00a0\"We have been saying for years that FDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety.\"",
      "All color additives must be approved by the FDA before they are used in food sold in the U.S. There are 36 FDA-approved color additives, nine of which are synthetic dyes.",
      "The FDA has said it has been actively reviewing Red No. 3\u2019s approval following a petition filed by a coalition of organizations, including the CSPI, asking the FDA to revoke the additive\u2019s approval in foods, noting its potential cancer risks.",
      "There are also concerns about whether artificial food dyes might affect children\u2019s behavior. The FDA in 2011 reviewed the possible link between artificial dyes and hyperactivity in children. It determined, however, that no causal relationship could be established.",
      "Although the FDA is now revoking its approval, ending its use nationwide, other states had already taken action.",
      "In California, which in 2023 became the first state to ban Red No. 3 and several other food additives linked to potential health problems, Democratic Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel said he was pleased with the FDA\u2019s decision.",
      "\"To me, this is a clear indication that our strategy of putting pressure on Washington and putting pressure on the FDA to look at these issues more closely, to step up to the plate and take their regulatory responsibilities seriously, is working,\" said Gabriel, who introduced California\u2019s bill banning Red No. 3 statewide as well as the\u00a0California School Food Safety Act, which bans six other synthetic dyes from food served in public schools.",
      "Gabriel said he has heard from Democrats and Republicans who are excited about the FDA\u2019s ban.",
      "\"There is a growing national movement around this that we have seen. It is a bipartisan movement,\" he said. \"This is an important moment, but I think it\u2019s just the beginning of a lot more to come.\""

    "title": "Trump's China tariff threats are helping fuel a manufacturing boom \u2014 in Mexico",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The migration of manufacturing to Mexico could undermine Trump\u2019s promise to voters that ratcheting up tariffs on China would incentivize companies to bring production back to the U.S and give American companies a more even playing field.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has indicated that one of his top priorities when he takes office next week will be to impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports, a move he claims would protect American jobs and bolster domestic manufacturing.",
      "But if recent trends are any indication, one of the biggest beneficiaries might be workers in Mexico.",
      "After Trump levied tariffs on billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Chinese goods in his first term, a growing number of companies moved manufacturing operations from China to Mexico. Industry analysts and executives working with Mexican manufacturers said that with Trump promising to escalate the trade war, they are seeing a renewed wave of interest from companies looking to shift production from China to Mexico.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and it\u2019s just getting started,\u201d said Raine Mahdi, whose company, Zipfox, connects businesses with manufacturers in Mexico. \u201cThe last time, this issue caught the tail end of the Trump administration, and then it pretty much died off with the Biden administration. Now it\u2019s already starting before Trump is even officially in office. It\u2019s not going to just go away. Companies are not going to be able to wait it out.\u201d",
      "There are generally no tariffs on goods made in Mexico that are shipped to the United States under the USMCA trade pact among the United States, Canada and Mexico \u2014 similar to the previous North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 though Trump has threatened Mexico with new tariffs if it doesn't do more to stop the flow of immigrants and drugs across its border.",
      "The migration of manufacturing to Mexico could undermine Trump\u2019s promise to voters that ratcheting up tariffs on China would give companies incentives to bring production back to the United States and give American companies a more even playing field. During Trump\u2019s first round of China tariffs, the number of companies moving production for the U.S. market out of China increased. But rather than relocate that production to the United States, many companies went to other low-cost countries, instead.",
      "\u201cIt will produce jobs in a few sectors who get protection and where there\u2019s not a way to make it offshore, but for most companies it just moves it from China to Vietnam or Mexico,\u201d said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economic. \u201cI really do think it\u2019s a false promise.\u201d",
      "Since his election, Trump has threatened to put tariffs on goods from Mexico on day one of his administration. But doing so would violate the USMCA trade pact \u2014 a deal Trump touted as a major negotiating victory during his first term. Breaching the agreement could trigger legal challenges and retaliatory tariffs that would affect U.S. companies, lawyers and trade policy analysts have said. It could also cause upheaval in the financial markets and increase prices for consumers on everything from cars to groceries, they said.",
      "The United States will be able to start renegotiating the USMCA pact in July 2026 under a provision in the agreement. If the three countries don\u2019t agree to extend the deal, it will terminate in 2036.",
      "But even with the looming uncertainty of tariffs, companies have continued their interest in Mexico, said Alejandro Delgado, Mexico country manager for SiiLA, a real estate data analytics firm.\u00a0Along with the low trade barriers, the close proximity to the United States means cheaper shipping costs and the ability to avoid potential bottlenecks at U.S. ports. Mexico also has relatively low labor costs, with a minimum wage of around $20 a day in the region near the U.S. border.",
      "\u201cSince Donald Trump\u2019s election, Chinese companies\u2019 interest in Mexico has remained, but with some uncertainty,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cOf course, there is this threat of implementing new tariffs, but the sense is that Mexico is in a better position to negotiate with the U.S. than China.\u201d",
      "In Nuevo Le\u00f3n, an area just south of the U.S. border, industrial parks full of Chinese companies have been springing up in recent years. Among those opening operations there are the equipment maker Lingong Machinery Group, which announced plans for a $5 billion industrial park, and the appliance maker Hisense, which said it would spend $260 million on a facility that it expects to create 7,000 jobs. Adjustable bed manufacturer Keeson Technology invested $30 million in a plant, and the Chinese furniture maker Kuka Home opened operations in Mexico in 2020 and announced a $150 million expansion in 2022 that it said would employ 3,500 people.",
      "In total, nearly $4 billion in investment deals were announced in 2023 by Chinese companies and an additional $1.4 billion were recorded in the first half of 2024, according to data compiled by the research firm Rhodium Group. While that is a relatively small amount compared with other countries with deeper ties to Mexico, it\u2019s nearly four times the average Chinese investment in Mexico from 2014 to 2020, the report found.",
      "The footprint of industrial real estate occupied by Chinese firms has doubled since 2021, with the largest investments coming from companies manufacturing higher-end products for the automotive and tech sectors, according to data from SiiLA. More than half of Chinese-based companies currently occupying industrial space in Mexico weren\u2019t present in the country before 2020, SiiLA said.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese are creative, they\u2019re ambitious, they\u2019re aggressive, and you can try to tariff them and contain them as best as you can, but they\u2019ll always try to find the side route, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done with Mexico,\u201d Mahdi said. \u201cYou can try to plug all the holes, but they\u2019ll make a new one, because that\u2019s what they do. Their country is about manufacturing for the world. They\u2019re the best at it, and they want to continue to hold that position as the world\u2019s manufacturing hub.\u201d",
      "To qualify as \"made in Mexico,\u201d products must undergo a significant transformation in Mexico even if their components originate from other countries. Under the USMCA trade agreement, if a Chinese company imports parts for an appliance or a piece of furniture and assembles it in Mexico, that item is classified as an import from Mexico rather than from China.",
      "In addition to Chinese-owned companies\u2019 opening operations in Mexico, U.S.-based and other multinational corporations are looking to shift their manufacturing of products for the U.S. market from China to Mexico to avoid tariffs and to lower shipping costs and delivery times. As a result, China\u2019s share of U.S. imports has fallen from 22% in 2018 to 11.5% in the first half of last year,\u00a0according to data from J.P. Morgan.\u00a0Mexico exported more goods to the United States in 2023 than China for the first time in more than two decades.",
      "\u201cWe have seen significant foreign companies coming into Mexico, not only from China but countries like Germany and Japan, and not only in manufacturing industries but also construction companies, logistics companies, packaging companies,\u201d Delgado said.",
      "The shift in manufacturing from China to Mexico could also upend Trump\u2019s proposal to use the money the United States collects from tariffs to fund a variety of other policy priorities, since products made there are generally tariff-free. Under Trump\u2019s last wave of China tariffs, much of the revenue went to payments to help cover farmers\u2019 losses from retaliatory tariffs China placed on U.S. agricultural products.",
      "The trend hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by members of Trump\u2019s incoming administration. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, wrote a letter in September urging President Joe Biden to stop Chinese firms from \u201cexploiting Mexico\u2019s duty-free entry to the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cAllowing Chinese firms \u2014 which routinely benefit from slave labor, stolen intellectual property, and massive state subsidies \u2014 to circumvent American trade enforcement and exploit our free trade agreements threatens American production,\u201d Rubio wrote. \u201cOur leaders must work diligently to replace Chinese production with American production, and that of our trading partners. Congress passed a free trade deal with Mexico\u2014not China. Immediate action must be taken to prevent the Chinese Communist Party from exploiting USMCA and weaponizing this important trade deal.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats and uncertainty around the future of the USMCA agreement have led to widespread uncertainty for some companies. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a Trump ally whom Trump has tasked with slashing federal spending, told investors in July that he was putting plans to build a factory in Mexico on hold over Trump\u2019s threat during the campaign to put tariffs on cars being shipped to the United States from Mexico.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tremendous uncertainty. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade for the Consumer Technology Association. \u201cThere are all these numbers being thrown out there by the president-elect. It\u2019s impossible for companies to plan with this kind of uncertainty. They\u2019re in a holding pattern. They\u2019re all waiting to see.

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris has a lot of options for her next act \u2014 including possible runs for governor of California in 2026 and president in 2028 \u2014 but writing a book may be first up, according to six people familiar with internal discussions about her future.",
      "Two of the people said that Harris, who will find herself out of elected office for the first time in more than two decades on Monday, has already decided to write a book. The others said the topic is under discussion.",
      "Thrust into the 2024 presidential campaign when President Joe Biden withdrew from the race in July, Harris quickly locked down the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination but lost the general election to former President Donald Trump. Since conceding to Trump, Harris has said little publicly about her 107-day sprint to try to save the presidency for her party. Not only could her written take recount the past, it could help shape her future.",
      "\u201cKamala Harris is poised to land the biggest book deal of any vice president in history,\u201d said Keith Urbahn, president and co-founder of the literary agency Javelin. \u201cBut the real question isn\u2019t the advance \u2014 it\u2019s whether the book can redefine her for 2028.\u201d",
      "Urbahn said Harris has an opportunity to \u201cget personal,\u201d acknowledge where she and the Democratic Party misread the sentiments of the electorate, and potentially reach out to a broader audience than her base.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a version of this book that is full of platitudes but safe, and then there\u2019s a version that reinvents her to lead a Democratic Party in need of rebuilding,\u201d he said. \u201cShe gets a payday either way, but only the latter gets her a second shot at the presidency.\u201d",
      "Many of Harris\u2019 advisers think she has a full-length story to tell, and that voters will want to read it.",
      "\u201cI think she owes it to people to write a book,\u201d one Harris confidant said.",
      "Ashley Etienne, who previously worked as Harris\u2019 vice presidential communications director, said that if Harris does write a book, she plans to buy copies of it for \u201call the women\u201d in her life, including her daughter.",
      "\u201cThe vice president is a historic figure with an incredible story to tell. From her leadership to tackle COVID, rebuild the economy and to protect the rights of women in this nation,\u201d Etienne said. \u201cPeople love her -- 70 plus million in fact. And I can imagine they\u2019re desperate for her to pull back the curtain on her groundbreaking journey from a child of immigrants to commanding the mantle of the most powerful country in the world.\u201d",
      "Harris\u2019 last book, \u201cThe Truths We Hold,\u201d released in conjunction with her first presidential campaign, landed at No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list in 2019. At the same time, she released a children\u2019s picture book, called \u201cSuperheroes are Everywhere.\u201d And in 2010, she wrote a memoir called \u201cSmart on Crime.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Americans who have joined the Chinese social media platform RedNote in protest of the U.S. government\u2019s looming ban on TikTok have found themselves building new connections across international borders.",
      "\u201cI just want to say it\u2019s so amazing to have you here,\u201d one person, who called himself Abe from RedNote, said in a video on the app, imploring the American \u201cTikTok refugees\u201d to stay with it. \u201cFor so long, we haven\u2019t really been able to connect or talk with each other like this, but now we finally can and it feels so special. This is such a real chance for us to get to know each other.\u201d",
      "Because of tensions between the Chinese and U.S. governments, their digital ecosystems haven\u2019t often overlapped. Many popular U.S. apps like Instagram are banned in China, and some companies like ByteDance, which owns TikTok, have built separate apps for the Chinese market and other markets because of rules and regulations.",
      "But user backlash to the U.S. government\u2019s proposed TikTok ban has led to a flood of Americans signing up for RedNote in the past 24 hours \u2014 a development many Chinese users said they thought would never happen. It is impossible to quantify how many TikTok \u201crefugees\u201d have made accounts on RedNote. Still, Chinese users have excitedly welcomed the new American users, whether that\u2019s in Mandarin, English or through the power of memes.",
      "On Monday, as the U.S. Supreme Court appeared to be leaning toward upholding the law banning TikTok starting this Sunday, many people began posting that they would join the China-based Chinese app out of spite.",
      "The law that banned TikTok was motivated by concerns over ByteDance\u2019s relationship to the Chinese government, and speculation that that relationship could be used to influence Americans or spy on them. The law would allow TikTok to remain in the U.S. following its sale to a U.S. company. However, a sale has yet to happen and experts say it seems unlikely.",
      "Many users going to Rednote \u2014 known as Xiaohongshu in China, or XHS and Little Red Book elsewhere \u2014 openly mocked U.S. concerns about security. One person posted to TikTok about Rednote, saying: \u201cI\u2019m going to download it on my phone. I\u2019m going to let it track other apps. I\u2019m going to give it permission to see my location and all of my contacts and then I\u2019m just going to let it sit there.\u201d",
      "After downloading the app, however, many began to notice that both they and the Chinese user base shared a similar sense of humor. One joke that has begun to circulate on TikTok is that people will \u201cmiss my Chinese spy\u201d following a ban. One TikTok video joking about this has been viewed more than 10 million times.",
      "Many Chinese on Rednote welcomed American users to the app playing into the joke.",
      "\u201cHello, I\u2019m a spy. Please show me your cat,\u201d one Chinese user commented on an American user\u2019s video.",
      "Others shared images of a Chinese statue appearing to carry the Statue of Liberty.",
      "One user joked in a video that he had been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.",
      "\u201cAfter so many years being yelled, \u201cGo back to China! Go back to your country!\u201d Finally, we get a shot,\u201d the Chinese user said. \u201cGo back to America! Go back to your country! Just kidding.\u201d",
      "One resounding joke on the majority Mandarin-speaking app included Chinese users politely asking the new American users for help with their English homework and if the American users would help them practice their English. Additionally, many users asked Americans to subtitle their videos so they could be translated into Mandarin.",
      "\u201coh so NOW you\u2019re learning mandarin,\u201d joked the language learning platform Duolingo on X.",
      "Additionally, those who were still using RedNote and TikTok warned users that there could be a culture shock in some ways \u2014 video that explicitly promote thinness and potentially unhealthy eating habits are common on RedNote because of cultural differences.",
      "Some still noted the benefits of having Chinese and Americans able to communicate directly.",
      "In a video shared on RedNote, British user Ethereal Games noted how unusual it was that \u201ceveryone has been really nice to each other, which is odd because this is the internet.\u201d He added how he thought this move by American users of RedNote completely undermined the TikTok ban.",
      "\u201cThe best part is it\u2019s completely backfired on the U.S. government because American citizens and Chinese citizens are getting along really well. They\u2019re not the scary Chinese enemy anymore,\u201d he said in his video. \u201cThey\u2019re sharing cat memes and talking about Taylor Swift.\u201d",
      "Toward the end of the second day of Americans inundating RedNote, the tone had remained jovial with people remarking over the good-natured camaraderie of their new social media friends. Many Chinese users posted that they were shocked by how many people were engaging with their content. Some made videos just to reintroduce their pages and encouraged their new American followers to keep using RedNote.",
      "\u201cHello, friends from TikTok. Welcome to XHS. I\u2019m shocked when I opened this application tonight because I cannot imagine that it will be an international place,\u201d said a 25-year-old Chinese user named Sylvia, who said she was based in Shanghai. \u201cI hope all of you can enjoy the time here, and I promise all of you will love it.\u201d",
      "Another Chinese user, who went by DWWWWW, said in a video how wild it was to have\u00a0 Americans on RedNote. In one video, DWWWWW began making \u201cChinese lessons from your SPY.\u201d In another he shared his disbelief for how many Americans were now following him.",
      "\u201cHey TikTok \u2018refugees,\u2019 I\u2019m so overwhelmed by you guys today,\u201d DWWWWW said in the video. \u201cThis is so cool and crazy. I\u2019m posting this to see if this is real. I\u2019m Chinese and you can ask me anything about China.\u201d",
      "He also offered one clarification for his new followers: \u201cYou might be in the wrong place because here is not the Chinese version of TikTok. Here is the Chinese version of Instagram.\u201d"

      "After Meta and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a series of changes that shifted the company and its policies to the right ahead of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term, some users are fleeing the company\u2019s platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "In the barrage of changes made in recent weeks, the company ended its third-party fact-checking program in the United States and said it would pull back on content moderation around political discourse. Instead, Meta will use a community notes system similar to Elon Musk\u2019s X. Updates to Meta\u2019s\u00a0policy on hateful conduct include that LGBTQ people can now be called mentally ill because of their identities. Meta also disbanded its diversity, equity and inclusion team.",
      "Zuckerberg isn\u2019t the only Big Tech billionaire currying favor with the incoming president. Musk and Jeff Bezos will both be seated in prominent spots at Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday. But Meta\u2019s changes, along with Zuckerberg\u2019s personal appeals to Trump, have caused a cascade of reactions among its users.",
      "NBC News reviewed hundreds of posts and comments across various social media platforms that said users would delete their Meta accounts, stop posting or boycott the company in response to the changes. The exodus is reminiscent of when X (formerly Twitter) users left the platform in large numbers after the 2024 election.",
      "\u201cI no longer feel safe to post on either platform as a queer Chicana woman,\u201d said Marie Valencia, a full-time artist who had more than 20,000 followers on Facebook and Instagram before she stopped posting. The term Chicana refers to American women of Mexican descent. \u201cI have seen a steady stream of folks abandoning their profiles as well, especially in the last couple weeks as Meta has dismantled DEI and speech protections for those most vulnerable online.\u201d",
      "Valencia has moved to posting on Bluesky, an alternative to X, as well as a platform for Latina women called Amigahood. \u201cMeta will become another X,\u201d Valencia said.",
      "Cord Jefferson, director of Academy Award best picture nominee \u201cAmerican Fiction,\u201d announced Sunday that he was leaving Instagram, but would remain active on Tumblr.",
      "\u201cSo many things are getting bleaker and grosser by the day. And while we can\u2019t place the blame for all of it at the feet of tech oligarchs, we can place the blame for a lot of it at the feet of tech oligarchs,\u201d Jefferson wrote on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m doing what little I can to shut the increasingly stupid ideas that shape online spaces like this out of my life.\u201d",
      "Some people have abandoned some of Meta\u2019s platforms while continuing to use others. Stanford University law professor Mark Lemley, who represents Meta in a copyright dispute involving artificial intelligence, announced Monday that he would be dropping the company as a client and reconsidering his use of Meta\u2019s platforms.",
      "\u201cI have struggled with how to respond to Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook\u2019s descent into toxic masculinity and Neo-Nazi madness,\u201d Lemley wrote. \u201cWhile I have thought about quitting Facebook, I find great value in the connections and friends I have here, and it doesn\u2019t seem fair that I should lose that because Zuckerberg is having a mid-life crisis.\u201d",
      "Lemley said he deactivated his account on Threads, Meta\u2019s X alternative, and that he will no longer buy products from ads he sees on Facebook or Instagram. Instead, he wrote that he will \u201cgo separately to the website to make sure Facebook doesn\u2019t get any credit for the purchase.\u201d",
      "The people leaving Meta still make up a small percentage of its overall user base. Close to 2 out of 3 people in the United States are on Facebook. There are almost 170 million Instagram accounts in the U.S. and almost 100 million accounts on WhatsApp. A weeklong \u201cLights Out\u201d boycott of Meta platforms starting Jan. 19 attracted a few hundred likely participants in a Facebook group.",
      "Some users have said they feel trapped on Meta platforms, especially WhatsApp, because they use the services to communicate with family members, friends and personal networks. Others have built platforms as influencers or for organizations and small businesses.",
      "Stacy Kess, founder of the nonprofit news organization Equal Access Public Media, told NBC News that she was \u201cdisheartened\u201d to see other people and organizations in the disability community continue to post on Meta platforms after the policy on hateful conduct was updated to allow calling LGBTQ people mentally ill.",
      "\u201cI just saw so many people still actively posting on Instagram, and I wondered how many of them knew about the policy change,\u201d Kess said. \u201cThat should be a hard line for both the disability and the LGBTQ community.\u201d",
      "Equal Access Public Media has accounts on Facebook, Instagram and Threads, which issued statements concerning the policy change Tuesday that said \u201cEAPM condemns this policy allowing dehumanizing and ableist language. We will continue to post elsewhere.\u201d The organization, which is raising funds to produce accessible news products in video, audio, American Sign Language and simplified English, has its largest following on Bluesky.",

    "story": [
      "After Meta and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a series of changes that shifted the company and its policies to the right ahead of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term, some users are fleeing the company\u2019s platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "In the barrage of changes made in recent weeks, the company ended its third-party fact-checking program in the United States and said it would pull back on content moderation around political discourse. Instead, Meta will use a community notes system similar to Elon Musk\u2019s X. Updates to Meta\u2019s\u00a0policy on hateful conduct include that LGBTQ people can now be called mentally ill because of their identities. Meta also disbanded its diversity, equity and inclusion team.",
      "Zuckerberg isn\u2019t the only Big Tech billionaire currying favor with the incoming president. Musk and Jeff Bezos will both be seated in prominent spots at Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday. But Meta\u2019s changes, along with Zuckerberg\u2019s personal appeals to Trump, have caused a cascade of reactions among its users.",
      "NBC News reviewed hundreds of posts and comments across various social media platforms that said users would delete their Meta accounts, stop posting or boycott the company in response to the changes. The exodus is reminiscent of when X (formerly Twitter) users left the platform in large numbers after the 2024 election.",
      "\u201cI no longer feel safe to post on either platform as a queer Chicana woman,\u201d said Marie Valencia, a full-time artist who had more than 20,000 followers on Facebook and Instagram before she stopped posting. The term Chicana refers to American women of Mexican descent. \u201cI have seen a steady stream of folks abandoning their profiles as well, especially in the last couple weeks as Meta has dismantled DEI and speech protections for those most vulnerable online.\u201d",
      "Valencia has moved to posting on Bluesky, an alternative to X, as well as a platform for Latina women called Amigahood. \u201cMeta will become another X,\u201d Valencia said.",
      "Cord Jefferson, director of Academy Award best picture nominee \u201cAmerican Fiction,\u201d announced Sunday that he was leaving Instagram, but would remain active on Tumblr.",
      "\u201cSo many things are getting bleaker and grosser by the day. And while we can\u2019t place the blame for all of it at the feet of tech oligarchs, we can place the blame for a lot of it at the feet of tech oligarchs,\u201d Jefferson wrote on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m doing what little I can to shut the increasingly stupid ideas that shape online spaces like this out of my life.\u201d",
      "Some people have abandoned some of Meta\u2019s platforms while continuing to use others. Stanford University law professor Mark Lemley, who represents Meta in a copyright dispute involving artificial intelligence, announced Monday that he would be dropping the company as a client and reconsidering his use of Meta\u2019s platforms.",
      "\u201cI have struggled with how to respond to Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook\u2019s descent into toxic masculinity and Neo-Nazi madness,\u201d Lemley wrote. \u201cWhile I have thought about quitting Facebook, I find great value in the connections and friends I have here, and it doesn\u2019t seem fair that I should lose that because Zuckerberg is having a mid-life crisis.\u201d",
      "Lemley said he deactivated his account on Threads, Meta\u2019s X alternative, and that he will no longer buy products from ads he sees on Facebook or Instagram. Instead, he wrote that he will \u201cgo separately to the website to make sure Facebook doesn\u2019t get any credit for the purchase.\u201d",
      "The people leaving Meta still make up a small percentage of its overall user base. Close to 2 out of 3 people in the United States are on Facebook. There are almost 170 million Instagram accounts in the U.S. and almost 100 million accounts on WhatsApp. A weeklong \u201cLights Out\u201d boycott of Meta platforms starting Jan. 19 attracted a few hundred likely participants in a Facebook group.",
      "Some users have said they feel trapped on Meta platforms, especially WhatsApp, because they use the services to communicate with family members, friends and personal networks. Others have built platforms as influencers or for organizations and small businesses.",
      "Stacy Kess, founder of the nonprofit news organization Equal Access Public Media, told NBC News that she was \u201cdisheartened\u201d to see other people and organizations in the disability community continue to post on Meta platforms after the policy on hateful conduct was updated to allow calling LGBTQ people mentally ill.",
      "\u201cI just saw so many people still actively posting on Instagram, and I wondered how many of them knew about the policy change,\u201d Kess said. \u201cThat should be a hard line for both the disability and the LGBTQ community.\u201d",
      "Equal Access Public Media has accounts on Facebook, Instagram and Threads, which issued statements concerning the policy change Tuesday that said \u201cEAPM condemns this policy allowing dehumanizing and ableist language. We will continue to post elsewhere.\u201d The organization, which is raising funds to produce accessible news products in video, audio, American Sign Language and simplified English, has its largest following on Bluesky.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re taking a moral absolutism kind of stance, we feel like we\u2019re just living our values by saying \u2018This is not OK,\u2019\u201d Kess said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to explore other options, because we know that there are other options.\u201d"

    "summary": "Americans who have joined RedNote in protest of the U.S. government\u2019s looming ban on TikTok have found new connections across international borders.",
    "story": [
      "Americans who have joined the Chinese social media platform RedNote in protest of the U.S. government\u2019s looming ban on TikTok have found themselves building new connections across international borders.",
      "\u201cI just want to say it\u2019s so amazing to have you here,\u201d one person, who called himself Abe from RedNote, said in a video on the app, imploring the American \u201cTikTok refugees\u201d to stay with it. \u201cFor so long, we haven\u2019t really been able to connect or talk with each other like this, but now we finally can and it feels so special. This is such a real chance for us to get to know each other.\u201d",
      "Because of tensions between the Chinese and U.S. governments, their digital ecosystems haven\u2019t often overlapped. Many popular U.S. apps like Instagram are banned in China, and some companies like ByteDance, which owns TikTok, have built separate apps for the Chinese market and other markets because of rules and regulations.",
      "But user backlash to the U.S. government\u2019s proposed TikTok ban has led to a flood of Americans signing up for RedNote in the past 24 hours \u2014 a development many Chinese users said they thought would never happen. It is impossible to quantify how many TikTok \u201crefugees\u201d have made accounts on RedNote. Still, Chinese users have excitedly welcomed the new American users, whether that\u2019s in Mandarin, English or through the power of memes.",
      "On Monday, as the U.S. Supreme Court appeared to be leaning toward upholding the law banning TikTok starting this Sunday, many people began posting that they would join the China-based Chinese app out of spite.",
      "The law that banned TikTok was motivated by concerns over ByteDance\u2019s relationship to the Chinese government, and speculation that that relationship could be used to influence Americans or spy on them. The law would allow TikTok to remain in the U.S. following its sale to a U.S. company. However, a sale has yet to happen and experts say it seems unlikely.",
      "Many users going to Rednote \u2014 known as Xiaohongshu in China, or XHS and Little Red Book elsewhere \u2014 openly mocked U.S. concerns about security. One person posted to TikTok about Rednote, saying: \u201cI\u2019m going to download it on my phone. I\u2019m going to let it track other apps. I\u2019m going to give it permission to see my location and all of my contacts and then I\u2019m just going to let it sit there.\u201d",
      "After downloading the app, however, many began to notice that both they and the Chinese user base shared a similar sense of humor. One joke that has begun to circulate on TikTok is that people will \u201cmiss my Chinese spy\u201d following a ban. One TikTok video joking about this has been viewed more than 10 million times.",
      "Many Chinese on Rednote welcomed American users to the app playing into the joke.",
      "\u201cHello, I\u2019m a spy. Please show me your cat,\u201d one Chinese user commented on an American user\u2019s video.",
      "Others shared images of a Chinese statue appearing to carry the Statue of Liberty.",
      "One user joked in a video that he had been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.",
      "\u201cAfter so many years being yelled, \u201cGo back to China! Go back to your country!\u201d Finally, we get a shot,\u201d the Chinese user said. \u201cGo back to America! Go back to your country! Just kidding.\u201d",
      "One resounding joke on the majority Mandarin-speaking app included Chinese users politely asking the new American users for help with their English homework and if the American users would help them practice their English. Additionally, many users asked Americans to subtitle their videos so they could be translated into Mandarin.",
      "\u201coh so NOW you\u2019re learning mandarin,\u201d joked the language learning platform Duolingo on X.",
      "Additionally, those who were still using RedNote and TikTok warned users that there could be a culture shock in some ways \u2014 video that explicitly promote thinness and potentially unhealthy eating habits are common on RedNote because of cultural differences.",
      "Some still noted the benefits of having Chinese and Americans able to communicate directly.",
      "In a video shared on RedNote, British user Ethereal Games noted how unusual it was that \u201ceveryone has been really nice to each other, which is odd because this is the internet.\u201d He added how he thought this move by American users of RedNote completely undermined the TikTok ban.",
      "\u201cThe best part is it\u2019s completely backfired on the U.S. government because American citizens and Chinese citizens are getting along really well. They\u2019re not the scary Chinese enemy anymore,\u201d he said in his video. \u201cThey\u2019re sharing cat memes and talking about Taylor Swift.\u201d",
      "Toward the end of the second day of Americans inundating RedNote, the tone had remained jovial with people remarking over the good-natured camaraderie of their new social media friends. Many Chinese users posted that they were shocked by how many people were engaging with their content. Some made videos just to reintroduce their pages and encouraged their new American followers to keep using RedNote.",
      "\u201cHello, friends from TikTok. Welcome to XHS. I\u2019m shocked when I opened this application tonight because I cannot imagine that it will be an international place,\u201d said a 25-year-old Chinese user named Sylvia, who said she was based in Shanghai. \u201cI hope all of you can enjoy the time here, and I promise all of you will love it.\u201d",
      "Another Chinese user, who went by DWWWWW, said in a video how wild it was to have\u00a0 Americans on RedNote. In one video, DWWWWW began making \u201cChinese lessons from your SPY.\u201d In another he shared his disbelief for how many Americans were now following him.",
      "\u201cHey TikTok \u2018refugees,\u2019 I\u2019m so overwhelmed by you guys today,\u201d DWWWWW said in the video. \u201cThis is so cool and crazy. I\u2019m posting this to see if this is real. I\u2019m Chinese and you can ask me anything about China.\u201d",
      "He also offered one clarification for his new followers: \u201cYou might be in the wrong place because here is not the Chinese version of TikTok. Here is the Chinese version of Instagram.\u201d"

      "Meta\u2019s new global rules allow \u201callegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like \u2018weird.\u2019\u201d",
      "Meta now also permits \u201ccontent arguing for gender-based limitations of military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs. We also allow the same content based on sexual orientation, when the content is based on religious beliefs,\u201d according to the new standards.",
      "\u201cMeta\u2019s new policies regarding hateful conduct give users the green light to share hateful rhetoric against LGBTQ+ people, plain and simple,\u201d Jonathan Ochart, CEO of Beverly Hills, California-based marketing firm The Postcard Agency, told Context/the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an email.",
      "\u201cMeta is fanning the fire of hate-fuelled discourse with serious repercussions.\u201d",
      "Scott Seitz, CEO of SPI Marketing in Guilford, Connecticut, said the changes jeopardize the social safety net that helps sustain the mental wellbeing of LGBTQ users.",
      "\u201cThe consequences will be devastating: increased suicide rates, hate crimes and pervasive discrimination against women and diverse communities,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his iconic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech in 1963 on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. He chose that location in part to honor President Abraham Lincoln as \u201ca great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today.\u201d Now, millions of people honor King in the same way.",
      "On the third Monday of January \u2014 close to King\u2019s Jan. 15 birthday \u2014 federal, state and local governments, institutions and various industries recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day. For some, the holiday is just that \u2014 time off from work or school. But, King\u2019s family and others carrying on his legacy of equality, justice and non-violent protest want Americans to remember that this holiday is really about helping others.",
      "While it is now a time-honored tradition, the establishment of the holiday had a prolonged, difficult path to acceptance.",
      "How the idea for MLK day began",
      "The idea to establish a national holiday for the civil rights icon arose as the nation was plunged into grief. U.S. Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, one of the longest-serving members of Congress known for his liberal stance on civil rights, proposed legislation to recognize King four days after his assassination outside a motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968.",
      "Supporters knew it would not be easy. King, who was 39 years old at the time, was a polarizing figure to half the country even before his death, said Lerone Martin, director of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. Polls conducted by the Washington Post and the New York Times indicated most Americans did not trust King or thought he was too radical because of his speeches on poverty, housing and against the Vietnam War.",
      "\u201cPeople say that King is moving too fast after 1965 and basically \u2018Hey, you got the Voting Rights bill done. That\u2019s enough,\u2019\u201d Martin said.",
      "The Congressional Black Caucus, founded by Conyers, tried to bring the legislation up for a vote for the next 15 years. Among the Republican rebuttals \u2014 public holidays don\u2019t apply to private citizens, King was a communist or King was a womanizer. In the meantime, his widow, Coretta Scott King, kept lobbying for it. Musician Stevie Wonder even released a song, \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d to rally support.",
      "So, what changed?",
      "By the 1980s, the social and cultural climate in the U.S. had shifted and the public was reflecting on racial progress, Martin said. Most Americans now were also regretting the Vietnam War. Supporters, meanwhile, were still calling for federal holiday status.",
      "In 1983, about 20 years after King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, legislation for a Martin Luther King Jr. Day on the third Monday of January cleared Congress and President Ronald Reagan signed it.",
      "States held back as activists stepped up",
      "Reagan\u2019s signing did not lead other Republicans to follow. It would be 17 more years until all 50 states observed it. Most of the foot-dragging came from the South \u2014 except for Arizona. Then in 1987, Gov. Evan Mecham rescinded his predecessor\u2019s executive order enacting a state holiday in Arizona.",
      "\u201cHe said \u2018Black people don\u2019t need a holiday. Y\u2019all need jobs,\u2019\u201d recalled Dr. Warren H. Stewart Sr., senior pastor at First Institutional Baptist Church in Phoenix. \u201cThat started the war.\u201d",
      "Stewart launched a group to lead \u201cpeople of all colors and all persuasions, faiths and parties\u201d in protest marches. Entertainers including Wonder canceled Arizona events. Companies moved conventions. The tipping point was the loss of hosting the Super Bowl. In 1992, Arizona became the first state where voter initiative reinstated the King holiday.",
      "Supporters took a victory lap the next MLK Day with a packed arena concert attended by Wonder and other artists. Even Rosa Parks was there. Stewart remembers speaking to the crowd.",
      "\u201cWhat I said there \u2014 and it still applies today \u2014 we\u2019ve won the holiday but the holiday is a symbol of liberty and justice for all and we must move from symbol to substance,\u201d he said.",
      "South Carolina was the final holdout until 2000. But, it was without the backing of the civil rights groups because it also allowed for a Confederate Memorial Day.",
      "A \u2018day on, not a day off\u2019",
      "Martin Luther King Jr. Day\u2019s reach has only grown in its 42 years.",
      "It\u2019s the only federal holiday where you take a \u201cday on, not a day off.\u201d In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed into law Congressman John Lewis and Sen. Harris Wofford\u2019s legislation making it a National Day of Service.",
      "Just about every major city and suburb has some revelry the weekend before, including parades, street festivals and concerts. The various service projects run the gamut \u2014 community clean-up, packing food boxes, donating blood.",
      "AmeriCorps, the federal agency that deploys volunteers to serve communities around the nation, has distributed $1.5 million in grants to 200 nonprofits, faith-based groups and other organizations for projects. CEO Michael Smith estimates there have been hundreds of projects involving hundreds of thousands of people for MLK day in recent years. Engagement seems to be expanding.",
      "\u201cYou know, any given day I see another project that has nothing to do with us,\u201d said Smith, who has served in President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. \u201cWhat\u2019s so important about the King holiday is not only the service that\u2019s going to happen, but how it creates a spark for people to think about how maybe they\u2019re going to serve all year long.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s something King\u2019s daughter, the Rev. Bernice King and CEO of the King Center in Atlanta, desires as well. She wishes people would do more than \u201cquote King, which we love to do.\u201d They need to do good work and commit daily \u201cto embrace the spirit of nonviolence.\u201d",
      "Martin also thinks it\u2019s important to learn about the man himself. He finds excitement in seeing people read or hear about the Nobel Peace Prize winner. But, nothing compares to taking in King\u2019s own writings such as his 1963 \u201cLetter from the Birmingham Jail,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cWe can arm ourselves with his ideals,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe can continue to have a conversation with him \u2014 not just on one day but actually throughout the year.\u201d"

    "summary": "YouTubers Myka Stauffer and her husband James Stauffer gave up custody of their adopted 4-year-old son in 2020. A new documentary explores the controversy.",
    "story": [
      "YouTubers Myka Stauffer\u00a0and James Stauffer ignited a firestorm of controversy when they gave up custody of their adopted 4-year-old son with special needs in 2020. Now a new HBO documentary series, \"An Update on our Family,\" revisits the Stauffers' story.",
      "The limited three-part series, which will premiere on HBO on Wednesday, Jan. 15, uses the Stauffer controversy to explore wider issues about what happens when parents decide to make their private family lives public.",
      "But why are the Stauffers' decisions so controversial? Take a look at how the family rose to social media stardom ... and then enraged their followers.",
      "Who is Myka Stauffer and her husband James?",
      "Myka Stauffer had a parenting and lifestyle YouTube channel with more than 700,000 subscribers.\u00a0Together with her husband, she and her four biological children \u2014 Nakova, Jaka, Radley and Onyx \u2014 had a family YouTube channel, The Stauffer Life, with more than 300,000 followers.",
      "Neither channel is publicly accessible on YouTube at the time of this story's publication.",
      "The Ohio-based vlogger parents\u00a0began inviting viewers into their international adoption journey in 2016, via social media. Myka Stauffer produced 27 videos with the boy they named Huxley, sharing everything from fundraising to grappling with the ever-changing rules surrounding international adoption to learning about their potential child\u2019s special needs.",
      "Why did Myka and James Stauffer adopt a child?",
      "In an article for Parade\u00a0in September 2019, Myka wrote, \"My husband was resistant (to adoption) at first, but after letting him reflect on the idea for several months, we both agreed to start researching and see what surfaced.\"",
      "The couple felt compelled to pursue an international adoption, \"and we kept being lead to China,\" Myka Stauffer wrote. Because Chinese adoption laws would only allow U.S. couples to adopt children with special needs, the couple had to decide if they were prepared to take on additional challenges.",
      "And then, Myka Stauffer wrote, she \u201csaw a little face that I couldn\u2019t walk away from.\u201d This little boy had a brain tumor; Myka Stauffer said that since she was an oncology nurse, \u201ctumors didn\u2019t scare me.\u201d",
      "She wrote, \u201cUltimately, his sad little face won our hearts over and we just knew that he was our little guy.\u201d",
      "Who is Huxley, the boy the Stauffers adopted?",
      "The boy was 2.5 years old when the whole Stauffer family flew to China to meet him and bring him to their home in America. They renamed him Huxley.",
      "Over the years, the Stauffers updated their followers on their experience adopting a child with special needs, sometimes on posts that featured advertising from major companies.",
      "Not all videos about Huxley were monetized, but many of the videos about adoption were some of the most watched on the channel, raising the Stauffers\u2019 profile and clout online. In the last two years, the video on their channel with the most views, 5.5 million, was\u00a0\u201cHuxley\u2019s EMOTIONAL Adoption VIDEO!! GOTCHA DAY China Adoption.\u201d",
      "Why did the the Stauffers find a new home for their adopted son?",
      "At the age of 4, Huxley was just starting to form words verbally and had learned a few words in sign language.",
      "Myka Stauffer said, in her Parade essay and in now-deleted videos, the family learned eventually that Huxley did not, in fact, have a brain tumor. Instead, they shared, he had a number of different medical issues: he suffered a stroke in utero, and had autism and sensory processing disorder.",
      "Eagle-eyed followers began to notice that Huxley was missing from photos and other posts on the family\u2019s social media and YouTube channel. In May 2020, the Stauffers posted a video that was viewed by TODAY.com and has since been deleted, explaining what was happening with their adopted son.",
      "\u201cOnce Huxley came home, there was a lot more special needs that we weren\u2019t aware of, and that we were not told,\u201d James Stauffer said in the video, titled \u201can update on our family.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor us, it\u2019s been really hard hearing from the medical professionals, a lot of their feedback, and things that have been upsetting,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve never wanted to be in this position. And we\u2019ve been trying to get his needs met and help him out as much as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not an ounce of our body that doesn\u2019t love Huxley with all of our being,\u201d Myka Stauffer added. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a minute that I didn\u2019t try our hardest and I think what Jim is trying to say is that after multiple assessments, after multiple evaluations, numerous medical professionals have felt that he needed a different fit and that (with) his medical needs, he needed more.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I feel like a failure as a mom? Like, 500%,\u201d Myka Stauffer said, adding that Huxley was living with a \u201cnew mommy\u201d in a \u201cforever home.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last couple months have been like the hardest thing I could have ever imagined to going to choosing to do ... after pouring our guts and our heart into this little boy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is thriving, he is happy, he is doing really well, and his new mommy has medical professional training, and it is a very good fit.\u201d",
      "Why are people upset by the Stauffers' decision?",
      "An online uproar followed the Stauffers' announcement.",
      "Almost 50,000 people (as of publication of this article) have signed a\u00a0Change.org petition\u00a0demanding that the Stauffers remove all monetized content featuring Huxley from YouTube. And in a now-completed case, local authorities investigated the \u201cwell-being\u201d of Huxley Stauffer in response to compaints. No charges were filed.",
      "TODAY.com reached out to the Stauffers' attorney and did not get a response. In 2020, in a statement to People magazine, Myka and James Stauffer\u2019s lawyers, Thomas Taneff and Taylor Sayers, said:",
      "\u201cWe are privy to this case and given the facts at hand, we feel this was the best decision for Huxley ... In coming to know our clients we know they are a loving family and are very caring parents that would do anything for their children.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince his adoption, they consulted with multiple professionals in the healthcare and educational arenas in order to provide Huxley with the best possible treatment and care,\u201d Taneff and Sayers continued. \u201cOver time, the team of medical professionals advised our clients it might be best for Huxley to be placed with another family.\u201d",
      "In the adoption world, failed adoptions are called \u201cdisruptions.\u201d While a disruption may seem stone-hearted from the outside, according to experts TODAY.com spoke with, these  anguished acts are complex and soul-crushing for all concerned.",
      "Myka Stauffer responded to some of the backlash in an Instagram post on June 24, 2020. That screenshot remains the most recent post on her page.",
      "\"I am sorry for the confusion and pain I have caused, and I am sorry for not being able to tell more of my story from the beginning,\" she wrote, adding, \"I was naive, foolish and arrogant.\"",
      "She also debunked a few rumors, writing that the Stauffers \"did not adopt a child to gain wealth.\"",
      "The new, three-episode documentary airing this week called \"An Update On Our Family\" looks at the broader world of family vlogging through the lens of the Stauffer family's story."

Once 10 o\u2019clock hits and the cameras begin rolling on TODAY\u2019s fourth hour, Jenna is fully present.",
      "But it\u2019s not 10 o\u2019clock yet, and Jenna already seems exuberant. Walking through Studio 1A in full glam and a one-shouldered green sweater dress, no one is a stranger. She hugs multiple colleagues, takes photos with excited visitors, and graciously accepts several compliments \u2014 because she is quite literally glowing, both inside and out. (She tells a skeptical colleague that she swears by putting Bio Oil on her skin.)",
      "Part of the attention might be because our cameras are snapping away for this photo shoot, but it\u2019s also symbolic. After five years as a co-host of TODAY with Hoda & Jenna, Jenna is stepping into a new era \u2014 and the world is watching.",
      "January 13 kicks off the beginning of Jenna & Friends \u2014 the successor to \u201cHoda & Jenna.\u201d On the latter, it was the crackle of Hoda & Jenna\u2019s genuine chemistry that resonated with audiences who saw themselves reflected in the hosts.

      "Jenna remembers the day in September 2024 Hoda asked\u00a0to meet in her office; she had something to tell her. When Jenna got there, a candle was burning. There, before the rest of the world knew, Hoda broke the news: She was moving on from TODAY. At age 60, she was ready to spend more time with her young children.",
      "Jenna\u2019s first reaction?",

      "Shocked by the news, Jenna immediately called her parents, former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush, in tears.",

      "Still, moving on from this \u201cwonderful, wonderful time\u201d has been a journey. Jenna says she has moved through the five stages of grief and has now reached the acceptance that eluded her when she first heard the news.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so proud of Hoda. I think she\u2019s doing exactly what she needs to do at this moment for her.\u201d",
      "For Jenna, this is more than the loss of a co-host, but also the loss of a champion. When Jenna first appeared on TODAY in 2009, she was a 27-year-old grade school teacher in Baltimore who was on the show to promote \u201cAna\u2019s Story,\u201d a book she wrote about the 17-year-old single mother living with HIV/AIDs she had met while working as a UNICEF intern in Latin America.",
      "An executive producer thought Jenna had the right spark for TV \u2014 and Hoda agreed. \u201cI never thought I would\u2019ve hosted an hour. But Hoda saw that in me,\u201d Jenna says, adding that through the years, Hoda helped her push past insecurities."

      "\u201cGomez is critiqued for experiencing the typical challenges of heritage speakers while being held to native speaker standards \u2014 a no-win situation that a rapidly growing number of Americans can relate to,\u201d Abbott wrote in a recent opinion piece for The Fulcrum.",
      "A 2023 study from the Pew Research Center found that 24% of U.S. Latino adults say they carry on a conversation in Spanish \u201ca little or not at all.\u201d",
      "According to the study, 54% of U.S. Latinos who say that only speak a little Spanish \u201csay another Hispanic person has made them feel bad for it.\u201d",
      "However, one commenter on X responding to Abbott argued that the issue wasn\u2019t with Gomez's language ability or identity, but with the fact that her Spanish skills did not match the demands of her role in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe author misses the point completely. This has nothing to do with racism. Selena Gomez should be proud of her Spanish,\u201d the X user wrote. \u201cBut her accent doesn\u2019t match the character that she plays in the movie. And that\u2019s very distracting for viewers who know exactly how Mexicans speak.\u201d",
      "Director Audiard has addressed issues with the actors' varying Spanish accents in the movie.",
      "\u201cThroughout the shoot we had problems, for instance, with Selena\u2019s accent in Spanish. She is Texan. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n speaks Castilian Spanish. She\u2019s from Madrid,\u201d he told The New York Times in November. \u201cGiven that I don\u2019t speak Spanish, the nuances of the Mexican accent versus the Castilian were lost on me. We had all these problems with accents, but we fixed them in the edit. We did a lot of dubbing.\u201d",
      "Some argue the movie perpetuates harmful trans stereotypes",
      "Some viewers have criticized the movie\u2019s depiction of trans people and the trans experience.",
      "GLAAD, the LGBTQ advocacy group formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, called \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\" a \u201cstep backward for trans representation\u201d and said the film \u201crecycles the trans stereotypes, tropes, and clich\u00e9s of the not-so-distant past.\u201d",
      "Some critics say the film perpetuates the harmful narrative that transitioning is a form of lying. Emilia keeps her past a secret from her wife, posing as Manitas' aunt.",
      "\u201cIts protagonist\u2019s transition is seen as duplicitous and dishonest, an act of manipulation through which she continues her selfish attempts to control those that she abandoned,\u201d Mattie Lucas wrote in a November review for Trans | Cendental Cinema.",
      "\u201cNot only is her transition portrayed as more of a disguise to evade the authorities, it\u2019s an act of continued selfishness that ends up destroying not only her own life, but the lives of those she loves,\u201d Lucas added.",
      "Film critic Juan Barquin called the movie \u201ca regressive picture masquerading as progressive\u201d and criticized the way masculinity and femininity were portrayed in the film.",
      "\u201cAny time Emilia \u2018reverts\u2019 to her \u2018old ways,\u2019 Gascon lowers her vocal register as if to equate masculinity with evil and femininity with good,\u201d Barquin wrote for Little White Lies magazine.",
      "Reviewer David Opie echoed this criticism, pointing to a scene when Emilia throws her wife Jessi onto a bed \u201cand threatens her using the same low, masculine voice she used pre-surgery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as if the so-called 'evil' in Emilia is a separate entity, the 'man' she was raised to be, rather than her being the same person going through a transitional journey,\u201d Opie wrote for Yahoo! Movies.",
      "Several critics and viewers, including Barquin, also took issue with one line from the movie in which Emilia describes herself as \u201chalf male, half female.\u201d",
      "Some transgender commentators shared counterpoints to these arguments and defended the film\u2019s representation of its trans protagonist.",
      "Journalist and critic Mey Rude, who is trans, rejected the argument that Emilia uses a \u201cmale voice\u201d in moments of anger.",
      "\u201cShe simply is a woman with a lower register, and when she gets angry, it shows,\u201d Rude wrote in a piece for Out Magazine. \u201cIf you listen to the scenes where Gasc\u00f3n is playing the character as Manitas, you can clearly hear a difference in the voice she uses in the fight scene with Gomez.\u201d",
      "Rude also argues that the film does not lean into \u201charmful trans tropes about trans women being deceptive or liars.\u201d",
      "\u201cEmilia isn\u2019t a liar because she\u2019s trans, she\u2019s a liar because she\u2019s a bad person and she\u2019s in many ways, afraid,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe movie shows that if you live a lie, whether you\u2019re trans or not, your lies will catch up with you.\u201d",
      "Writer Julie River, who is trans, argues in a piece for Out Front magazine that Emilia is portrayed sensitively as a \u201cmorally complex\u201d character who makes \u201ca desperate attempt to atone for her sins in her former life.\u201d",
      "River also argues that Emilia hides her transition not because the movie is painting trans people as duplicitous, but because as a cartel leader, Emilia \"was hardly surrounded by people who were easy to come out to or who were likely to accept her transition.\u201d",
      "\u201cI may be amongst the minority in the LGBTQ+ community doing this, but I\u2019ll be applauding it for every award it wins,\u201d River wrote.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n herself has pushed back at people calling her \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d character transphobic.",
      "\u201cThere are some that say, \u2018I want to see LGBTQ or trans characters outdoing what people do in real life,\u2019 but we do bad things too ... I don\u2019t understand the criticism about the representation of portraying Emilia P\u00e9rez this way,\u201d she told Vanity Fair in January. \u201cThe reality is that the trans experience is not the same for everybody \u2014 my trans experience is different from somebody else\u2019s.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, go and make your own movie,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n also said. \u201cGo create the representation you want to see for your community.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A ceasefire deal was reached Wednesday to end\u00a015 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip, according to President Joe Biden, Qatar's prime minister and Hamas officials.",
      "The\u00a0hard-won agreement will also free dozens of hostages held in Gaza, as well as Palestinians in Israeli jails, bringing the first real break in violence since a weeklong truce expired Dec. 1, 2023.",
      "The deal will take effect Sunday, according to Qatar\u2019s prime minister and foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, whose country hosted weeks of intense negotiations.",
      "Under the phased agreement, Israeli forces would withdraw to the Gaza border, allowing displaced Palestinians to return to their homes and for the transfer of hostages and prisoners. Large amounts of humanitarian aid would be shipped to the enclave and hospitals and health care centers would be rebuilt, he said.",
      "Hamas, meanwhile, will release 33 hostages in exchange for 100 Palestinian prisoners with life sentences, according to a portion of the deal shared by Hamas. Israel will also release 1,000 Palestinian prisoners who were not involved in the Oct. 7 attacks, the text says, and an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners will also be released abroad or in Gaza.",
      "In a statement, Biden hailed \u201cmany months of intensive diplomacy\u201d by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar. \u201cMy diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done,\u201d the outgoing president said in part.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "In subsequent on-camera remarks, Biden said he was \u201cdeeply satisfied this day has finally come, for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony, and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza, who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war.\u201d",
      "The news follows comes amid a brutal winter for civilians in Gaza, as well as dramatic developments across the Middle East that have dealt setbacks to Iran, an Israeli foe.",
      "\u201cWe are very happy to reach a deal today to stop the aggression against our people, but unfortunately we were unable to reach the same deal last May,\u201d Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, told NBC News.",
      "In a statement, Netanyahu's office touted what it characterized as a compromise on Hamas' part.",
      "\"In light of Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s firm stance, Hamas has backed down on its demand at the last minute to change the deployment of forces on\" the Philadelphi Corridor, the Israeli name for the narrow strip of land between Gaza and Egypt.",
      "\"However, there are still several unresolved clauses in the outline, and we hope that the details will be finalized tonight,\" the prime minister's office added.",
      "\"It\u2019s also really sad to know that Carmel could have and should have been among them, but a deal didn\u2019t come in time and she was murdered in captivity,\" he said.",
      "Earlier, a diplomatic source in Washington told NBC News that Netanyahu was preparing to meet with his security Cabinet, where approval of the deal was expected quickly.\u00a0He would then take the pact to the full Cabinet, which is also expected to approve.",
      "Israel\u2019s Supreme Court would have 24 hours to permit an appeal, so the earliest a ceasefire could go into effect would be Friday, the source said.\u00a0The first group of hostages would come out Sunday, the person added.",
      "Israel launched its military campaign in the Palestinian enclave after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terrorist attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. Just more than 100 were released in late November 2023 during a pause in hostilities, in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "The war has shattered Gaza\u2019s infrastructure and displaced most of its population. Health officials in the enclave say more than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, most of them civilians.",
      "The chances for a ceasefire seemed vanishingly small after many false dawns in recent months.",
      "The Biden administration had called for a final effort before the president leaves office, and many in the region and in Washington viewed Trump's inauguration Monday as an unofficial deadline."

      "Of the 251 hostages kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, 94 people are still being held in Gaza \u2014 34 of whom have died.",
      "The first 33 hostages, defined as \u201chumanitarian cases,\u201d would be released during the first phase of the deal, a senior Israeli official told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Fighting began in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas carried out a terror attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed. That saw Israel launch an air and land assault on Gaza, killing more than 46,000 people, most of them civilians, according to local officials.",
      "President Joe Biden said this week that a deal to end the war was \u201con the brink\u201d of being completed.\u00a0Washington is looking to secure the deal before President-elect Donald Trump takes office Monday.",
      "Until that happens, though, the violence continues. At least 17 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza late Tuesday, according to the enclave\u2019s Health Ministry. A separate Israeli strike on Jenin, in the occupied West Bank, killed at least six people, the ministry said.",
      "The Israeli military said in a statement it had \u201cstruck more than 50 terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip, including terrorist cells, weapons storage facilities, underground infrastructure, anti-tank fire positions, and Hamas military structures.\u201d",
      "Alongside the Palestinians desperate for this bombardment to end, Israelis have for months begged their government to bring home their relatives who were kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7. They have often been deeply critical of Netanyahu, whom they accuse of prioritizing the war and keeping together his fractious right-wing coalition government over the safety of their loved ones.",
      "As they have throughout this conflict, thousands of people gathered Tuesday night in the Tel Aviv plaza that has in recent months become known as \u201cHostages Square.\u201d Among them was Moran Stela Yanai, who spent 54 days in captivity after being abducted at the Supernova music festival on the morning of Hamas' surprise attack.",

      "The Bibas family said they had read reports that their relatives were among those set to be freed. Yarden Bibas, his wife Shiri and their sons Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 1, were taken from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7.",
      "\"We have learned from experience and disappointment, and therefore, until our loved ones cross the border, there is no end to the story,\" the family said in a statement. \"We are waiting for certainty regarding their release and their condition and ask that you do not contact us during this sensitive period.\""

      "Biden, who will leave office next week, said that his administration was \"working urgently\" to solidify a deal that would bring an end to the deadly fighting in Gaza and see the release of hostages held by Hamas. Israeli's military offensive in Gaza, launched after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terrorist attack which Israeli officials say killed 1,200 people, has now dragged on for more than 15 months and killed more than 46,500 in the enclave, according to local health authorities.",

      "It \u201cremains a very challenging, often very contentious and in a long-term way deeply competitive relationship,\u201d Ambassador Nicholas Burns told NBC News in an interview this week. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. We\u2019re rivals for global power.\u201d",
      "Still, the world\u2019s two biggest economies have learned that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to talk to each other,\u201d Burns said, adding that \u201cthere are times when we have to work with China because it\u2019s in the American national interest.\u201d",
      "China is increasingly challenging the U.S.-led international order that has been in place since the end of World War II, working to various degrees with Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "The two countries have profound differences on issues such as trade, technology, the status of Taiwan and human rights, and blame each other for cyberattacks and the deadly U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s been unduly provocative in the Taiwan Strait with its military maneuvers,\u201d Burns said, adding that Beijing \u201chas made a major mistake and continues with that mistake in helping Russia to prosecute its illegal and barbaric war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Beijing denies that it is aiding the Russian war machine or carrying out cyberattacks on the U.S. that Burns said are \u201con a scale of lethality that is unprecedented.\u201d",
      "Burns is winding down his job after nearly three years of managing the day-to-day tensions of what is often described as the world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship and navigating some of its lowest points in decades.",
      "If Beijing wants to maintain the newfound stability in ties, \u201cI think the onus is on the government here in China to make that happen,\u201d Burns said.",
      "One thing the Chinese government can do, he said, is lift its sanctions on Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., if he is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Rubio and other U.S. lawmakers were sanctioned in 2020 over their criticism of authorities\u2019 crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey have to talk to the American secretary of state,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Burns declined to comment directly on how the incoming Trump administration might manage the U.S.-China relationship, though he said he had been in touch with former Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., whom Trump has said he will nominate as his China ambassador.",
      "Trump has advocated a tougher approach toward the country than the Biden administration.",
      "In what may be indirect advice to Trump and his Cabinet appointees, Burns emphasized the importance of talking with China as well as maintaining regional alliances the Biden administration has fortified in order to counter China\u2019s influence, the future of which is uncertain as Trump begins a second term.",
      "\u201cWe have got to keep our allies close to us,\u201d Burns said, pointing to South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and India.",
      "Working with allies \u201cmultiplies and expands American power in trying to deter some of these really pernicious actions\u201d by China, Russia and others, Burns said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one way to compete with China effectively, to win part of the competition for power, but also to keep the peace with China,\u201d he said.",
      "Slowly thawing ties",
      "In-person diplomacy was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept China\u2019s borders closed for three years. During this time, the previous Trump administration ratcheted up criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, which began in China.",
      "When Burns arrived in Beijing in March 2022 to take up his post, he spent most of the first month of his job in quarantine at the ambassador\u2019s residence, unable to meet anybody even as the relationship he was tasked with steering was heading to new lows.",
      "At the same time, Chinese nationalism and anti-Western sentiment surged across state media and online platforms here, and the people-to-people exchanges that Burns likes to call the \u201cballast\u201d of the relationship have never really recovered.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has the tightest grip on power here since Mao Zedong, and has carried out an internal campaign against corruption that, during Burns\u2019 term alone, saw a foreign minister and two defense ministers expelled from their positions and the public eye. The heightened scrutiny has made some Chinese officials, academics and average citizens more reluctant to engage with foreigners.",
      "Relations hit their lowest point in decades in August 2022, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, visited the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan over China\u2019s objections. They sank even lower in early 2023, when the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been spotted over the continental United States.",
      "\u201cIt took us a while to dig out of that,\u201d Burns said. Since then, both sides have moved to stabilize ties.",
      "China has only recently resumed direct military and other communications that were cut off in protest over Pelosi\u2019s visit. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has since had two meetings with his Chinese counterpart.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s significant because we\u2019re trying to drive down the probability or the chance of any kind of accident or misunderstanding between our military forces,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Another example of improved cooperation, he said, is in addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, one of the areas where Biden and Xi agreed to cooperate at a summit in California in November 2023. Many of the precursor chemicals used to make the deadly opioid originate in China before being processed into fentanyl in Mexico and other countries, then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have begun to see action from the government of China,\u201d Burns said, including 300 arrests, the shutdown of online sales of illicit chemicals and the scheduling of 55 synthetic opioids and precursor chemicals as prohibited for export.",
      "Burns pointed to other successes in the Biden administration, including the release of four Americans who had been detained in China for years: David Lin in September, and Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung in November.",
      "\u201cTo meet them at the airport, to give them their passports, to tell them that they were free people again was an extraordinary moment, certainly for me as the American ambassador,\u201d Burns said.",
      "Though all Americans the State Department considered wrongfully detained by China have been released, hundreds of others remain imprisoned on various charges, more than in any other foreign country. They continue to receive consular assistance.",
      "In the interest of keeping the lines of communication open, Burns urged members of Congress from both parties to make greater efforts to visit China.",
      "\u201cI have hawkish views on the relationship between China and the United States. Many members of Congress do, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be here to understand the adversary and to talk to the adversary and to know the reality on the ground.\u201d",

      "To add insult to injury, when she discussed her misfortune on the French television channel TF1, the 53-year-old interior designer known only as \"Anne\" was hit with a wave of mockery and trolling so bad that the station had to pull her interview with its \"Seven to Eight\" show.",
      "\u201cThe story broadcast this Sunday has resulted in a wave of harassment against the witness,\u201d TF1 presenter Harry Roselmack posted on his X account Tuesday. \u201cFor the protection of victims, we have decided to withdraw it from our platforms.\u201d",

      "Over the next few months, she exchanged several messages on different social media and messaging platforms, including WhatsApp, with the fake Pitt, even receiving AI-generated selfies of the 61-year-old actor, whose facsimile told her he needed money for cancer treatment.",

      "The request for money came after the scammers told Anne that Pitt was in the hospital with kidney cancer and needed money for the treatment, but that his bank accounts were allegedly frozen because of his divorce proceedings with ex-wife Angelina Jolie.",
      "She was hesitant at first, but eventually transferred the large sum of money to an account in Turkey after receiving an email from the fake star\u2019s \u201cdoctor.\u201d",
      "Anne said she finally realized she had been the victim of a scam after she saw pictures of the real Pitt with his current partner, In\u00e8s de Ramon, last summer. \u201cI ask myself why they chose me to do such harm like this?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never harmed anyone. These people deserve hell.\u201d",
      "The French newspaper\u00a0Sud Ouest reported that Anne was going through divorce proceedings with a millionaire entrepreneur at the time. She reportedly suffered from severe depression and was hospitalized following the scam.",
      "Police are now investigating the con, but the interview has nevertheless sparked a deluge of jokes online.",
      "Among the individuals, organizations and companies making jokes at Anne's expense was Netflix France, which promoted \u201cfour films to see with Brad Pitt (really) for free\u201d in a post on X.",
      "Artificial intelligence has increased the risk of identity theft and  fraud online, which contributed to over $8.8 million in losses in the U.S., according to the Federal Trade Commission.",

      "At a news conference this month, President-elect Donald Trump bragged, \u201cWe defeated ISIS.\u201d",
      "It has been a point of pride for him, and it is true. In the first year of Trump\u2019s first term,\u00a0U.S. forces, working with Syrian Kurdish allies,\u00a0defeated\u00a0the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d and liberated\u00a0its capital. But the fall of the Assad regime has left Syria at risk of coming apart under pressure from a variety of terrorist groups, local militias and Israeli airstrikes. And Syria\u2019s interim leaders, while proclaiming moderate intentions, have roots\u00a0in Al Qaeda and\u00a0another terrorist group, Hayat al Sham (HTS). The\u00a0nightmare scenario for many experts is that\u00a0ISIS could re-establish its stronghold in the fledgling state and export more terrorism to the West or inspire it, as it did the New Year\u2019s Day attack in New Orleans.",
      "The situation means that, once he is in office,\u00a0Trump will\u00a0most likely\u00a0have to make some hard choices \u2014\u00a0insist on withdrawing all or some of the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, in line with his previous positions,\u00a0or leave them in place to prevent an ISIS resurgence and a tarnishing of what he sees as his accomplishment in his first term. U.S. withdrawal\u00a0could easily re-create Syria as a base of operations for terrorist attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Israel, the United States and Europe.",
      "The United States has been relying on fighters from the\u00a0Syrian Defense Force (SDF),\u00a0an alliance led by Kurds\u00a0in northeast Syria,\u00a0to guard thousands of\u00a0captured\u00a0ISIS\u00a0fighters and their families\u00a0there. At the height of the war\u00a0against ISIS, Gen. Joseph Votel, a former commander of U.S. Central Command,\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0that the SDF\u2019s fighters were among the best he has ever led.",
      "But the SDF\u2019s commander in chief, Gen. Mazloum\u00a0Abdi,\u00a0told The Guardian this\u00a0month\u00a0that ISIS is growing in strength after it seized weapons from the collapsed\u00a0Syrian\u00a0regime. He\u00a0also\u00a0said the Kurdish forces are coming under increased pressure from\u00a0Turkish\u00a0President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who views them, along with\u00a0Kurdish separatists based in Syria\u00a0known as the PKK,\u00a0as threats\u00a0to his regime.",
      "Outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken said\u00a0Monday in an interview with NBC News that the U.S. role in helping guide and shape what is happening in Syria is \u201cessential.\u201d",
      "Blinken described the situation on the ground as \u201cincredibly fragile,\u201d warning that \u201cwhat happens inside of Syria doesn\u2019t stay inside of Syria,\u201d with the potential for terrorism that goes well beyond its borders.",
      "The United States has a stake in the \u201cextraordinary opportunity that is now before the Syrian people to actually control their own lives and their own destinies,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cThat means, I believe, keeping some presence, but it also means being very engaged in all of the efforts to help support a Syrian-owned, Syrian-led transition to get the country to a better place.\u201d",
      "Theodore\u00a0Kattouf,\u00a0a career diplomat who was the U.S. ambassador to Syria under President George W. Bush,\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0recently\u00a0that even if Trump were to continue bombing campaigns and targeted operations against the terrorist group, removing U.S. troops would leave the Kurdish coalition vulnerable and ultimately lead to an expanded footprint for ISIS.",
      "\u201cWith those troops out of there, we\u2019re putting a lot of U.S. interests at risk,\u201d\u00a0Kattouf\u00a0said. \u201cI don\u2019t see\u00a0[HTS]\u00a0or other allied rebel forces able to take on that issue right now.\u201d",
      "The fear among Biden administration counterterrorism officials\u00a0is that\u00a0a Trump withdrawal of U.S. forces would leave the Syrian Kurds guarding the ISIS prisoners vulnerable to attacks from other factions \u2014 or the looming presence of Turkey, just across the border.\u00a0Both\u00a0Trump in his first term and President Joe Biden\u00a0have worked hard to restrain Erdo\u011fan,\u00a0whose country remains\u00a0a NATO ally, from attacking America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Trump said\u00a0at his news conference last week that\u00a0he had asked Erdo\u011fan\u00a0not to\u00a0go\u00a0after \u201ccertain people,\u201d clearly referring to the Kurds. Trump added, \u201cPresident Erdo\u011fan\u00a0is his friend of mine, he\u2019s a guy I like, respect. I think he respects me also.\u201d",
      "Beyond serving as a base for operations and planning, any Syrian territory that falls to ISIS could help it project an image of power and resistance and inspire others around the world. The group has already been\u00a0expanding its global\u00a0reach through social media, sponsoring attacks and\u00a0influencing followers worldwide, including so-called lone wolves,\u00a0through what anti-terrorism experts say is a surge of sophisticated online propaganda. CIA Director William Burns\u00a0told NPR\u00a0last\u00a0week\u00a0that\u00a0the agency is \u201cquite concerned\u201d about the rising threat posed by ISIS, particularly its \u201cability to inspire people.\u201d\u00a0And in July, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned the House Judiciary Committee that \u201cthe greatest terrorism threat to our homeland has been posed by lone actors or small cells of individuals who typically radicalize to violence online and use easily accessible weapons to attack soft targets.\u201d",
      "The U.S. intelligence community\u00a0and the FBI have been sounding those alarm bells for more than a year.\u00a0A senior administration official\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0on Friday, \u201cThere is a heightened focus on ISIS,\u201d pointing to the cancellation of three Taylor Swift Eras Tour shows in Vienna in August after warnings from U.S. intelligence of ISIS terrorist plots targeting the venues. And in March, gunmen from ISIS-K, an affiliate of ISIS based in Afghanistan, killed more than 130 people at the Crocus City Hall, a well-known concert venue outside Moscow, despite warnings from U.S. intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",
      "\u201cSyria could provide the group with the momentum that it\u2019s long sought to kind of spill back onto the headlines, whether that\u2019s ISIS K in Afghanistan, ISIS core, ISIS Central and Syria and parts of Iraq, and again, the homegrown violent extremists that live in the West that ISIS is attempting to push over the edge conduct the types of attack that we saw in New Orleans,\u201d counterterrorism\u00a0expert\u00a0Collin Clarke\u00a0of the Soufan Group\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0after the New Orleans attack.",
      "Clearly alarmed by the possibility of the collapsed state\u2019s exporting terrorism to Europe,\u00a0two weeks ago\u00a0the foreign ministers of France and Germany, representing the European Union, traveled to Damascus to meet Syria\u2019s interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa,\u00a0who was\u00a0known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, before he disavowed his connections with\u00a0HTS.",
      "American boots?",
      "\u201cSyria is a mess, but is not our friend,\u201d Trump said on X in the hours before the collapse of the Assad regime, adding, \u201cThe United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser,\u00a0Rep. Mike Waltz,\u00a0R-Fla.,\u00a0echoed Trump\u2019s reluctance for the United States to intervene in Syria but underscored the incoming administration\u2019s commitment to combating ISIS. \u201cWe do not need American boots running around Syria in any way, shape or form, but we\u2019re keeping an eye on those things, ISIS, Israel\u2019s border, and kind of the broader dynamic with our Gulf allies,\u201d Waltz said on a podcast late last month.",
      "But experts question the ability to continue the fight against ISIS in Syria without a U.S.\u00a0military\u00a0presence.",
      "During the transition, a senior Biden administration official said, the current administration has been briefing Trump\u2019s national security team on the need for a continued U.S. military presence to prevent Russia, Turkey or Iran from gaining dominance. The outgoing Biden administration has itself been treading carefully, sending its top Middle East diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Barbara\u00a0Leaf, to Damascus only after European counterparts had already visited and only after\u00a0public pressure\u00a0from the mother of Austin Tice, the American journalist believed to be imprisoned in Syria,\u00a0who said\u00a0the United States should be more engaged.\u00a0To even meet with the new interim leader, the State Department first\u00a0had to lift\u00a0the\u00a0$10\u00a0million bounty\u00a0it\u00a0had\u00a0put\u00a0on\u00a0his\u00a0head\u00a0when he led\u00a0HTS.",
      "But now the critical question of whether the United States should play a role in preventing Syria from again harboring terrorists or permitting power plays from U.S. regional adversaries will be on Trump\u2019s doorstep as he arrives at the White House. That and the challenge of combating the online propaganda that spreads ISIS\u2019 terrorist philosophy far and wide."

      "\u201cThe enemy continues to terrorize Ukrainians,\u201d Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook, urging residents to stay in shelters during the air raid alerts and follow official updates.",
      "Moscow launched more than 40 missiles, and at least 30 were shot down, said Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, adding about 70 strike drones were involved in the attack. It remains unclear how many were intercepted.",
      "The state energy company Ukrenergo reported emergency power outages in the Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kirovohrad regions.",
      "The attack comes a day after the Russian Defense Ministry\u00a0accused Ukraine of firing multiple Western-made missiles\u00a0at Russia\u2019s Bryansk region on the border with Ukraine, claiming in an online statement that the attack \u201cwill not go unanswered.\u201d Kyiv has not confirmed the attack.",
      "However, during the almost 3-year war, Russian forces have persistently attacked Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure to plunge the country into darkness and exhaustion during the winter months.",
      "And Wednesday\u2019s attack has further exacerbated the strain on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure.",

      "Russian forces launched missile strikes targeting\u00a0energy infrastructure\u00a0in the western Lviv region early Wednesday, said the city\u2019s mayor, Andrii Sadovyi.",
      "\u201cDuring the morning attack, enemy cruise missiles were recorded in the region,\u201d he said.",
      "Lviv regional head Maksym Kozytskyi said Russia hit and damaged two infrastructure facilities in the area of Drohobych and Stryi. No casualties were reported, he added.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force detected multiple missile groups launched by Russia during a nationwide air-raid alert, though initial reports indicated no damage.

      "The Russian Defense Ministry said that it launched a strike on \u201ccritically important facilities of gas and energy infrastructure that ensure the functioning of Ukraine\u2019s military industrial complex.\u201d It didn\u2019t give the target locations or other details.",
      "The barrage came a day after the Russian Defense Ministry vowed a response to what it said was an attack on Russian soil using\u00a0multiple Western-supplied missiles.",
      "Kyiv hasn\u2019t confirmed that attack, though it said Tuesday that it hit an oil refinery and a fuel storage depot, a chemical plant producing ammunition and two anti-aircraft missile systems, in a missile and drone attack that reached around 1,100 kilometers (almost 700 miles) into Russia.",
      "Long-range attacks have been a feature of the\u00a0nearly three-year war, where on the front line snaking about 600 miles from northeast to southern Ukraine, the armies have been engaged in a war of attrition. Russia has been advancing on the battlefield over the past year, though its progress has been slow and costly.",
      "Russia attacked Ukraine with 43 missiles and 74 drones overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force said. A total of 30 missiles and 47 drones were shot down, and 27 drones failed to reach their target, it said.",
      "The Russian missiles sought out targets from the Lviv region in western Ukraine near Poland to Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine bordering Russia. The state energy company Ukrenergo reported emergency power outages in six regions. It often shuts down production during attacks as a precaution.",

      "Ukrainian authorities try to rebuild their power generation after the attack, though the barrages have eroded production. Western partners have been\u00a0helping Ukraine rebuild.",

      "Siddiq, 42, is a former local councilor who was elected lawmaker for a north London district in 2015. She was appointed to the government after Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s center-left Labour Party won a landslide election victory in July.",
      "Starmer has been under growing pressure to remove Siddiq from her post since she referred herself to the government\u2019s ethics watchdog in early January following reports that she lived in London properties linked to her aunt.",
      "Starmer said he was sad to see Siddiq go, adding in a letter that the watchdog \u2014 independent adviser on ministerial interests Laurie Magnus \u2014 \u201chas assured me he found no breach of the Ministerial Code and no evidence of financial improprieties on your part.\u201d",
      "Starmer offered Siddiq the possibility of returning to government, saying \u201cthe door remains open to you going forward.\u201d",

      "The minister faced further questions about her links to her aunt\u2019s government after reports in the Sunday Times and Financial Times newspapers alleged that she had used two London apartments given to her by associates of Bangladesh\u2019s Awami League, led by Hasina.",
      "Magnus said \u201ca lack of records and lapse of time\u201d meant he had not seen all potentially relevant information, but added that \u201cI have not identified evidence of improprieties\u201d over the apartments.",
      "Magnus concluded that Siddiq hadn\u2019t breached ministerial standards. But he noted that given her role in government \u201cit is regrettable that she was not more alert to the potential reputational risks \u2014 both to her and the government \u2014 arising from her close family\u2019s association with Bangladesh.\u201d"

      "\u201cUnlike the first execution attempt, this time there were no individuals or security staff actively obstructing the execution, and there were no significant physical clashes,\u201d the CIO said in a briefing.",
      "In an address to the nation, Yoon said that the warrant was illegal but that he decided to comply \u201cto prevent an unfortunate and bloody confrontation.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the rule of law in this country has completely collapsed,\u201d he said, according to his office.",
      "Investigators who arrived before dawn at Yoon\u2019s presidential residence were met by members of his security service, who blocked them from detaining Yoon during their first attempt on Jan. 3.",
      "Lawyers for Yoon and lawmakers from his People Power Party were also on the access road leading to the residence, arguing that the warrant was illegal and blocking the police from progressing toward the residence\u2019s entrance.",
      "Nearby, thousands of Yoon\u2019s supporters and critics held dueling protests in below-freezing temperatures. Many of Yoon\u2019s conservative supporters carried American flags and placards with slogans inspired by President-elect Donald Trump, such as \u201cStop the Steal\u201d \u2014 a reference to Yoon\u2019s unsubstantiated claims of election fraud which he cited among his reasons for declaring martial law.",
      "Police officers could later be seen making progress toward the hillside villa after they pushed through multiple blockades made up of vehicles and barbed wire.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal team said Wednesday that he was willing to appear for questioning voluntarily rather than be taken into custody. But a convoy of black SUVs was later seen leaving the presidential compound with a police escort, and Yoon arrived at the CIO office shortly afterward."

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 02:36:54 GMT",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump designated Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism shortly before he left office in January 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Cuba said it will release 553 political prisoners after the Biden administration announced Tuesday it is removing Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and taking other \u201cgoodwill\u201d actions.",
      "The Catholic Church had been negotiating with the communist-run government over the release of the prisoners. Most of them were jailed following unprecedented islandwide protests in July 2021. A brutal crackdown initially led to the arrests of more than 1,000 people. Many faced prison sentences of up to 30 years.",
      "\"I thank all those who contributed to the decision announced today by the United States to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, where it should never have been,\" Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel wrote on X. \"Together with two other measures adopted, they have had a high cost for the country and Cuban families.\"",
      "Before Cuba's announcement, a senior administration official told reporters that to support the Catholic Church and facilitate the agreement, Biden would notify Congress that he seeks to remove Cuba from the terrorism list, as well as to take other actions.",
      "\u201cAn assessment has been completed, and we do not have information that supports Cuba\u2019s designation as being a state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d the Biden official said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump designated Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism shortly before he left office in January 2021, five years after President Barack Obama removed it. Trump can reverse Biden\u2019s actions as soon as he takes office next week.",
      "Three Cuban American Republican members of Congress from Florida, Mario D\u00edaz Balart, Maria Elvira Salaz\u00e1r and Carlos Gimenez, posted a video on X, rejecting Biden's moves and calling them \"pathetic.\"",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, whose father is Cuban, criticized Biden\u2019s actions. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is unacceptable on its merits,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cThe terrorism advanced by the Cuban regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the decision.\u201d",
      "In Cuba, Havana residents welcomed the news about Biden's actions.",
      "\"This is definitely good for our country, because we would have more possibilities, more resources. It's an advancement. One step at a time,\" said Dainerys Hern\u00e1ndez, a bartender.",
      "Joel Rivera, a public worker, agreed. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good decision. It\u2019s true that we need to be taken off that list, because we shouldn't be there in the first place,\" he said.",
      "In addition to removing Cuba from the list, the Biden administration will issue a waiver for Title III of the Helms Burton Act, which allows the original owners of Cuban properties confiscated decades ago to sue foreign companies \u201ctrafficking\u201d in them.",
      "In 2019, Trump was the first president not to waive Title III. Every president before him had waived the 1996 law, officially called the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, every six months, fearing it could harm U.S. trade.",
      "\u201cWe expect and anticipate that these measures announced today will bring very quick relief to the many dozens of Cubans who were arrested in conjunction with the July 2021 protests, as well as bring relief to their family members,\u201d the Biden official said.",
      "Biden is also easing some economic pressure on Cuba by rescinding National Security Presidential Memorandum 5, which was originally established on June 16, 2017.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s actions demonstrate that President Biden\u2019s Cuba policy, which is focused on achieving practical results with respect to human rights in Cuba, will pay dividends for the Cuban people,\u201d the senior administration official said.",
      "Speculation over Trump\u2019s foreign policy has swirled, particularly because of the potential influence of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a Cuban American who is Trump's pick for secretary of state. Rubio, a foreign policy hawk, has always advocated for a hard-line policy toward Cuba.",
      "Mauricio Claver-Carone, the architect of some of Trump's tough Latin America policies during his first administration, was chosen as special envoy for Latin America.",
      "CORRECTION (Jan. 14, 2025, 9:36 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the status of political prisoners in Cuba. They will be released; they have not been released."

    "story": [
      "A group of global experts is proposing a new way to define and diagnose\u00a0obesity, reducing the emphasis on the controversial body mass index and hoping to better identify people who need treatment for the\u00a0disease caused\u00a0by excess body fat.",
      "Under recommendations released Tuesday night, obesity would no longer be defined solely by BMI, a calculation of height and weight, but combined with other measurements, such as waist circumference, plus evidence of health problems tied to extra pounds.",
      "Obesity is estimated to affect more than 1 billion people\u00a0worldwide. In the U.S., about 40% of adults have obesity, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u201cThe whole goal of this is to get a more precise definition so that we are targeting the people who actually need the help most,\u201d said Dr. David Cummings, an obesity expert at the University of Washington and one of the 58 authors of the report published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal.",
      "The report introduces two new diagnostic categories: clinical obesity and pre-clinical obesity.",
      "People with clinical obesity meet BMI and other markers of obesity and have evidence of organ, tissue or other problems caused by excess weight. That could include heart disease, high blood pressure, liver or kidney disease or chronic severe knee or hip pain. These people would be eligible for treatments, including\u00a0diet\u00a0and\u00a0exercise\u00a0interventions and\u00a0obesity medications.",
      "People with pre-clinical obesity are at risk for those conditions, but have no ongoing illness, the report says.",
      "BMI has long been considered a flawed measure that can over-diagnose or underdiagnose obesity, which is currently defined as a BMI of 30 or more. But people with excess body fat do not always have a BMI above 30, the report notes. And people with high muscle mass \u2014 football players or other athletes \u2014 may have a high BMI despite normal fat mass.",
      "Under the new criteria, about 20% of people who used to be classified as obese would no longer meet the definition, preliminary analysis suggests. And about 20% of people with serious health effects but lower BMI would now be considered clinically obese, experts said.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t dramatically change the percentage of people being defined as having obesity, but it would better diagnose the people who really have clinically significant excess fat,\u201d Cummings said.",
      "The new definitions have been endorsed by more than 75 medical organizations around the world, but it\u2019s not clear how widely or quickly they could be adopted in practice. The report acknowledges that implementation of the recommendations \u201cwill carry significant costs and workforce implications.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the health insurance trade group AHIP, formerly known as America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said \u201cit\u2019s too early at this point to gauge how plans will incorporate these criteria into coverage or other policies.\u201d",
      "There are practical issues to consider, said Dr. Katherine Saunders, an obesity expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-founder of the obesity treatment company FlyteHealth. Measuring waist circumference sounds simple, but protocols differ, many doctors aren\u2019t trained accurately and standard medical tape measures aren\u2019t big enough for many people with obesity.",
      "In addition, determining the difference between clinical and pre-clinical obesity would require a comprehensive health assessment and lab tests, she noted.",
      "\u201cFor a new classification system to be widely adopted, it would also need to be extremely quick, inexpensive, and reliable,\u201d she said.",
      "The new definitions are likely to be confusing, said Kate Bauer, a nutrition expert at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\u201cThe public likes and needs simple messages. I don\u2019t think this differentiation is going to change anything,\u201d she said.",
      "Overhauling the definition of obesity will take time, acknowledged Dr. Robert Kushner, an obesity expert at the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine and a co-author of the report.",
      "\u201cThis is the first step in the process,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to begin the conversation.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Queen Elizabeth II was not officially informed about the treachery of a senior palace courtier for nearly a decade, newly declassified documents reveal.",
      "Anthony Blunt served as the chief art curator to the royal family, surveying the queen\u2019s pictures, overseeing the paintings in the royal collection and occasionally exhibiting her private treasures to the public. He endeared himself to the queen, so much so that he was given a knighthood \u2014 despite the fact that he had lived a double life as a Soviet spy.",
      "The files, among a trove from the\u00a0intelligence agency MI5\u00a0that were released Tuesday by Britain\u2019s National Archives, shed new light on the Cold War scandal at the heart of the British establishment. The saga has long captivated historians and featured in popular culture, from spy novels to Netflix's \"The Crown.\"",
      "Blunt confessed in 1964 to spying for the Soviet Union as part of the notorious Cambridge Five spy ring during World War II, but the queen would only be told the full story in 1973 \u2014 responding calmly and without surprise, according to the documents. His true identity was eventually exposed to the public by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, speaking in Parliament in 1979.",
      "The security services closely guarded Blunt's identity given his prominent position, with only a few senior officials informed, though the secret may have been known regardless. The queen\u2019s private secretary, Martin Charteris, was told only that MI5 intended to interrogate Blunt due to his close ties with fellow spy Guy Burgess, who fled to the Soviet Union.",
      "In all likelihood, the events \u201ctell us more about the inability of the state to prosecute Blunt\u201d than a concerted effort by MI5 to keep the late queen in the dark, historian Chris Smith, who authored a biography of Cambridge Five spy John Cairncross, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cTo have informed Her Majesty or anyone else for that matter would have been potentially defamatory; it would also have been deemed embarrassing to Her Majesty,\u201d Smith said.",
      "By the time Blunt was revealed to have been a spy, he had also become the consummate establishment figure, \u201cwhich was acutely embarrassing\u201d for the royal family, Smith added.",
      "As such, concealing the information \u201cwould also have allowed the palace to truthfully deny that Her Majesty had any knowledge of Blunt\u2019s espionage activities, shielding her from personal embarrassment.\u201d"
