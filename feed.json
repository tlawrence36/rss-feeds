    "story": [
      "Tenor Rolando Villaz\u00f3n has made his Metropolitan Opera directing debut with Bellini's \u201cLa Sonnambula.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tenor Rolando Villaz\u00f3n was singing the title role in Massenet's \u201cWerther\u201d in 2006 at Nice, France, when he started thinking about how he would direct the opera.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018oh, this last act is very difficult. He shot himself and keeps singing for 40 minutes.' And so, what would I do?\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I started inventing, creating for fun a staging.\u201d",
      "Nearly two decades later, Villaz\u00f3n is making his Metropolitan Opera directing debut in Bellini's \u201cLa Sonnambula,\u201d which opened Monday night with a standout cast of Nadine Sierra, Xabier Anduaga and Alexander Vinogradov.",
      "\u201cHe is very sensitive to singers,\u201d Sierra said. \u201cMaybe some directors, because they\u2019re not singers or they were never singers, it\u2019s hard for them to really relate to the psychological struggle that some singers, we deal with on stage. We want to make our characters as believable as humanly possible through the actions that we show, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to do that because you also have to sing high notes.\u201d",
      "Villaz\u00f3n grew up in Mexico City, won Pl\u00e1cido Domingo\u2019s Operalia competition in 1999 and made his European debut that year in Massenet\u2019s \u201cManon\u201d at Genoa, Italy. He debuted at the Met in Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata\u201d in 2003 and gained wide renown when he sang Alfredo with Anna Netrebko\u2019s Violetta in Willy Decker\u2019s austere staging at the 2005 Salzburg Festival.",
      "Vocal problems developed in 2007, causing Villaz\u00f3n to cancel his schedule, and he had surgery in 2009 to remove a cyst from his vocal cords. He developed performance anxiety around 2015 and had another operation in 2018 to relieve acid reflux.",
      "\u201cTwo things coincided when I stopped singing for a year in 2009 \u2014 and that was I wrote my first novel and I prepared my staging, but both didn\u2019t happen because I was resting,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I have finished my novel? I don\u2019t know. But stage direction for sure that would have happened.\u201d",
      "When Villaz\u00f3n conceived his \u201cWerther\u201d staging, he shared it with Alain Lanceron, then head of the tenor's record label, Virgin Classics. Richard Jones, a director Villaz\u00f3n had worked with, helped him find a theater. After being turned down in Berlin, Villaz\u00f3n won over Serge Dorny, then general director in Lyon and now head of the Bavarian State Op\u00e9ra.",
      "Villaz\u00f3n's \u201cWerther\u201d debuted in 2011, and he directed Donizetti\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore\u201d the following year at Baden-Baden, Germany, while also singing Nemorino.",
      "He has gone on to direct Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata,\u201d Donizetti\u2019s \u201cDon Pasquale,\u201d Strauss\u2019s \u201cDie Fledermaus,\u201d Rameau\u2019s \u201cPlat\u00e9e,\u201d Bellini\u2019s \u201cI Puritani\u201d and Rossini\u2019s \u201cIl Barbiere di Siviglia,\u201d and has upcoming productions of Mozart\u2019s \u201c Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\u201d and Rossini\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Italiana in Algeri.\u201d",
      "His \u201cSonnambula\u201d unfolds in an icy Alp village within a single set in front of projections and was first seen at Paris\u2019 Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-Elys\u00e9es in 2021, then at Nice in 2022 and Dresden, Germany, in 2023. It was to have traveled to the Met in 2023-24 but was postponed because of budget cuts.",

He was more in the trenches with the singers than most directors are.\u201d",
      "Villaz\u00f3n rejects the happy ending of Donizetti and librettist Felice Romani. Rather than Amina awakening from sleepwalking in ecstasy when she learns Elvino will marry her, she gives him back his ring and runs off to an independent future. He tweaked the direction for New York, cutting the dancing spirits Amina hallucinates from three to one and adding a globe, a telescope and a newspaper as gifts from Count Rodolfo to show the worldly curiosity she seeks.",
      "\u201cIt remains in essence the concept I had thought for it, the concept of a closed society, patriarchal, for sure very religious, where there is a strange woman adopted by a widow,\u201d Villaz\u00f3n said. \u201cShe is obliged to follow the rules and to adapt to the way the community behaves for the good of the community, but she still feels this call of the wild.\u201d",
      "Sierra and Anduaga had sung these roles in a Barbara Llutch staging that opened in Madrid in December 2022 and traveled to Barcelona last April before coming to New York to work with Villaz\u00f3n,",
      "\u201cHe really understands our situation,\u201d Anduaga said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to to do anything weird or strange with the body because he knows that all the movements are important, but the singing is the most important thing.\u201d",
      "Villaz\u00f3n learned from his experience with a string of top directors, including Decker, Jones, Robert Carsen, Claus Guth, Christof Loy and Bart Sher.",
      "\u201cRichard Jones told me: `You ask something three times,'\u201d Villaz\u00f3n recalled. \u201d`If the performer doesn\u2019t do it, either he or she is unable to do it or incapable to do it. In either case, you will not get what you\u2019re asking, so move on and think of something else.\u2019\u201d",

      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \u201cThe Best of Joy of Painting,\u201d based on Ross' show, \u201cAmerica's Test Kitchen,\u201d \u201cJulia Child's French Chef Classics\u201d and \u201cThis Old House.\u201d",

      "The thirty paintings to be auctioned span Ross\u2019 career and include landscapes depicting serene mountain vistas and lake scenes, his signature aesthetic. He created most of the 30 on-air, each in under 30 minutes, which was the span of a single episode.",
      "Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750. The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said.",

      "Taylor Swift's new film, \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d has topped the weekend box office with $33 million in North America",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 This weekend\u2019s box office belonged to two undeniable draws: Taylor Swift and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.",
      "It might have looked like a heavyweight matchup, but Swift\u2019s devoted fanbase once again proved unstoppable with her film \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d which debuted at No. 1 with $33 million in North America, according to Sunday estimates from Comscore. The AMC Theatres release -- announced only two weeks ago with minimal promotion -- served as a companion piece to Swift\u2019s 12th studio album, packaging music videos, behind-the-scenes footage and profanity-free lyric visuals into an 89-minute experience.",
      "The film played at all 540 AMC theaters in the U.S. for three days, ending after Sunday. AMC aired the show in Mexico, Canada and across Europe.",
      "\u201cFor Taylor Swift to harness the power of the movie theater to build her brand, create excitement among her fans, and create a communal experience outside of her touring, outside of her live performances, is really a stroke of genius,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cTo be able to add another $33 million to the box office bottom line is much welcomed by theater owners who were looking for content for their big screens.\u201d",
      "It comes nearly two years after her \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d concert film opened to $96 million, with Swift extending her streak of box office dominance.",
      "Meanwhile, Johnson saw a more modest showing. His A24 drama \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d co-starring Emily Blunt, opened in third place with a mere $6 million, trailing Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d which earned $11.1 million and has now accumulated $107 million globally.",
      "Despite strong reviews and a 15-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival -- where Johnson drew praise for portraying MMA legend Mark Kerr \u2014 the film marked one of the lowest openings as a lead.",
      "\u201cWhen major movie stars branch out into more indie roles, like Tom Cruise in \u201dMagnolia,\" they're trying to redefine their career,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThey can straddle both universes, so Dwayne Johnson and all the acclaim he\u2019s getting. That prestige factor. That\u2019s the currency. He knows box office. He studies this and he's a business person. But also realize that when you go outside of your comfort zone, it puts him in a certain light. ... Dwayne Johnson is redefining what he can do.\u201d",
      "Beyond the two marquee names, the rest of the weekend lineup offered a wide mix ranging from animated adventures to horror sequels and international releases.",
      "DreamWorks Animation\u2019s family adventure \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie\u201d debuted in fourth place with $5.2 million, expanding the popular Netflix preschool series to the big screen. Warner Bros.\u2019 supernatural thriller \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rites\u201d followed in fifth with $4 million, pulling in $458.2 million globally.",
      "In sixth was \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 Infinity Castle,\u201d the latest entry in the hit Japanese anime saga, earning $3.5 million. A re-release of \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d made a splash in seventh with $3.1 million \u2014 a solid return for the 2022 blockbuster ahead of \u201cAvatar: The Fire and Ash\u201d on Dec. 19.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 were \u201cThe Strangers: Chapter 2\u201d with $2.8 million, the IFC dark comedy \u201cGood Boy\u201d with $2.2 million, marking the company's second-best opening weekend ever. \u201cKantara: A Legend \u2013 Chapter 1\u201d with $1.7 million.",
      "Dergarabedian said he's looking forward to October films such as \u201cTron: Ares,\u201d \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d and \u201cRoofman,\" starring Channing Tatum.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A judge remained undecided Friday on the treatment and placement plan for a man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and ramming his car into the front gate of her home.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, a 48-year-old from Mississippi, has pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and vandalism. But in May, Judge Maria Cavalluzzi found him not competent to stand trial after evaluations from two experts. At Friday\u2019s hearing in a Los Angeles court dedicated to mental health cases, she heard arguments on Carwyle's treatment and placement.",
      "Aniston\u2019s lawyer, Blair Berk, spoke on her behalf for the first time, detailing two years of Carwyle\u2019s harassment and stalking, including various failed attempts to make physical contact with the actor.",
      "Cavalluzzi said she leaned toward sending Carwyle to a mental health treatment alternative to imprisonment. She requested another hearing, scheduled for later this month, to hear from a mental health professional before making a final decision.",
      "Prosecutors and Aniston\u2019s attorney will have a chance to weigh in, Cavalluzzi said.",
      "The judge acknowledged Aniston's \u201cvery real\" fear, but she said she can't ignore the opinions of mental health professionals who have evaluated Carwyle and deemed him not a danger to society. The alternative treatment option offers community-based housing, treatment and support services as opposed to incarceration.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Carwyle had been harassing the \u201cFriends\u201d star with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, \u201conly feet away from where she was,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Carwyle had a stated and \u201cpersistent delusion\u201d to impregnate Aniston with three children, Berk said, and \u201cthere is simply no way to prevent him from carrying out his delusion if he walks out.\u201d",
      "The prosecution expressed concern that if Carwyle were offered the treatment in Los Angeles, nothing would stop him \u201cfrom traveling those few miles to Ms. Aniston,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Berk and William Donovan, the deputy district attorney, argued Carwyle was a present danger to Aniston and those around her. Berk said he attempted to enter her property twice, but was turned away.",
      "Carwyle\u2019s lawyer, Robert Krauss, said his client qualifies for alternative treatment, arguing that he hasn\u2019t been convicted of violent crimes. Granting him alternative treatment, \u201cis not like giving him a break or showing him leniency,\u201d Krauss said. \u201cIts just one thing and one thing only \u2014 and that is absolute, pure faithfulness of the law.\u201d",
      "Krauss also referenced a report from the probation department, which recommended Carwyle be granted probation and 90 days in jail if convicted, much less than the over three years maximum sentence for his two charges. Carwyle has been in jail since May and, if convicted, could be let out with time served.",

      "When Cavalluzzi asked how she can be sure he won\u2019t walk away from the treatment program \u2014 a stated concern from the prosecution \u2014 Carwyle responded, \u201cYou have my word.\u201d",

      "Donovan argued that a state hospital is a \u201cmuch safer, much more effective place for him to go,\u201d and will offer the treatment Carwyle needs to address his delusions. The prosecution also argued there\u2019s no evidence that Carwyle\u2019s delusions toward Aniston have stopped, even with medication.",

      "The hearing was postponed several times in recent months as Carwyle at first objected to the incompetence finding and asked for an opinion, and both sides sought more time to examine the case.",
      "Carwyle remains jailed, but he is under a judge's order not to contact or get near Aniston.",
      "Authorities said Aniston was home at the time of the gate crash, but he did not come into contact with her. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. No one was injured.",

      "For Taylor Swift\u2019s most dedicated audience, a new album means new opportunities to decode Easter eggs in her lyrics and music videos. The pop superstar\u2019s 12th studio album has no shortage of clever clues and references to her public life and discography. Many are opaque, revealing just enough to inspire a myriad of fan theories. Others are concrete \u2013 explicit names and places worth exploring. Below, you will find a guide to those instances, and how they relate to Swift.",

And this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour.\u201d She and beau Kelce were spotted last year in Lake Como, Italy, but it is unclear if they spent time in nearby Portofino. Additionally, the standard version of her album is available in \u201csweat and vanilla perfume Portofino orange vinyl.\u201d As for the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e? That\u2019s a luxury hotel in Paris.",
      "Lyric: \u201cBe my NY when Hollywood hates me\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift's 12th album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" shows she's still at the top of the cultural mainstream",
      "Who is Taylor Swift\u2019s heir apparent? Her 12th album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d offers an answer. It\u2019s Taylor Swift.",
      "Her last album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d ended with the cautionary \u201cClara Bow,\u201d an allegory that seemed to suggest her tenure atop the cultural mainstream was inherited from stars of the past, like the namechecked Stevie Nicks \u2014 and that a new generation of younger, elastic female pop performers could soon take her place. In 2025, there are many to choose from: Consider Chappell Roan\u2019s full-throated theatrics, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s fiery punk-pop feminism, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s cheeky sexuality. In the knotty themes of Friday's \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d best illustrated in the title track, Swift asserts that the baton hasn\u2019t been passed, but rather shared. Because she isn\u2019t going anywhere.",
      "\u201cAnd all the headshots on the walls / Of the dance halls are of the b------ / Who wish I\u2019d hurry up and die,\u201d she sings with a wink, \u201cBut I\u2019m immortal now, baby dolls / I couldn\u2019t if I tried.\u201d Notably, if she has a chosen successor in someone else, it\u2019s the album\u2019s sole feature: Carpenter, who sings on the stomp-clap closer in her newly adopted twang. The mournful glissando of lap steel \u2014 the album\u2019s most country moment \u2014 arrives only with Carpenter\u2019s introduction. The western genre is Swift\u2019s past and Carpenter\u2019s future.",
      "If Swift is co-signing Carpenter, she\u2019s also learning from her. Carpenter has cornered the market on tight pop songs with pert, provocative messages; Swift does the same with the manspreading swagger of the George Michael-interpolating \u201cFather Figure,\u201d which mentions a protege, and the funky \u201cWood.\u201d (A carefully veiled PG-13 lyric: \u201cHis love was the key / That opened my thighs,\u201d she sings. \u201cGirls, I don\u2019t need to catch the bouquet / To know a hard rock is on the way.\u201d) Interwoven are suggestive, sensual ad-libs ... and a direct reference to fiance Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast.",
      "Across a brisk 12 tracks \u2014 Swift\u2019s tendency toward abundance doesn\u2019t manifest itself in a double album this time around, but instead in her endless vinyl variants \u2014 \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d mostly delivers on its promise of up-tempo pop \u201cbangers,\u201d to borrow her own vernacular. Fans need not wait up for the long-anticipated \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d because \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d pulls from its essence. But this time, with a lot of affection, like a truer \u201cLover\u201d era.",
      "Swift has long internalized criticisms and responded to them in her art, most directly in 2017\u2019s \u201cReputation.\u201d Here, she is once again concerned with her perception, articulated over booming, lush production on \u201cCANCELLED!\u201d or \u201cElizabeth Taylor.\u201d On the latter, she sings, \u201cHollywood hates me / You\u2019re only as hot as your last hit, baby.\u201d Except this time, her love acts as an anchor. \u201cI can\u2019t have fun if I can\u2019t have you,\u201d she flirts.",
      "For \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d Swift enlisted Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, the hitmaking duo she collaborated with on 2012\u2019s \u201cRed,\u201d 2014\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d and, of course, \u201cReputation.\u201d Notably absent is her frequent producing partner Jack Antonoff. It\u2019s a wise decision: In years past, Swift, Shellback and Martin\u2019s pop experiments shifted not only her career trajectory but the genre itself. Before \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\u201d an EDM drop in the middle of a radio pop hit was unimaginable. After, the style would dominate for half the decade.",
      "\u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d isn\u2019t as seismic, but there are addictive and idiosyncratic Swiftisms here: acerbic wit and thick literary references in glassy pop hooks. Where a song like \u201cOpalite,\u201d if attempted by another other performer, would lose its weightlessness under its voluble aspirations, Swift manages to swoon. Stacked, opalescent harmonies and a vintage swing give the song, fittingly, an almost iridescent quality.",
      "And there are bops, like the undeniable opener \u201cThe Fate of Ophelia\u201d with its 1980s-via-Robyn synth-pop and momentary \u201cSummertime Sadness\u201d vocal delivery.",
      "There\u2019s a treasure trove of deliciously quotable lines, too, as expected. \u201cPlease God bring me a best friend who I think is hot,\u201d she manages to make effortless in the \u201cMidnights\u201d-esque \u201cWi$h Li$t,\u201d a lovely song about the mundanity of romance and the suburban fantasy of \u201ca couple kids \u2026 a driveway with a basketball hoop.\u201d",
      "Swift\u2019s dense vocabulary is on full display, often full of charm. But it is sometimes unwieldy, a common criticism of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d like when she overstuffs \u201cOur thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition on foolish decisions which led to misguided visions\u201d into \u201cFather Figure,\u201d momentarily overvaluing clever writing over clever cadence.",

    "story": [
      "Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is",
      "Benny Safdie\u2019s \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d isn\u2019t what you think it is, especially if you think it\u2019s a movie about a British guy who thinks his typewriter is the tops.",
      "\u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is. It\u2019s the solo directorial debut of the younger Safdie, whose films with his brother, Josh, have rarely not sprinted headlong into unsettling tumult. Add that sensibility to a true-life tale of a mixed martial arts fighter in the late \u201990s, and it\u2019s only natural to spend much of \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bracing for tragedy, for some ear-splitting descent into macho calamity.",
      "Yet \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d starring Dwayne Johnson as MMA pioneer Mark Kerr, is something simpler and less curious. A lack of probing was never anything you could accuse a Safdie brothers\u2019 movie of; these are the filmmakers who plunged a camera into the body cavity of a jewelry-store owner in \u201cUncut Gems.\u201d But, despite its grainy, VHS aesthetics, \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is a surprisingly conventional and oddly untroubled movie, albeit one that gives Johnson an indie-film platform for one of his finest performances.",
      "As Mark, Johnson has drained away much of his big-screen charisma. The part \u2014 brawny, often shirtless, frequently raging in the ring \u2014 is immediately so close to Johnson\u2019s own professional wrestling background that early scenes look almost documentary-like. But gone is the megawatt grin and the dashing eyebrow lift. Johnson\u2019s normally polished bald head is here covered with a closely cropped dark head of hair.",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening, Mark rhapsodizes about his feeling of domination. An opponent\u2019s fear, he says, you can \u201csmell in their scent.\u201d At this point, Mark has known only victory in thumping triumphs that leave him feeling like a god. Losing, he confesses, is unfathomable.",
      "The laws of moviedom decree, of course, that Mark will soon lose, and his well-earned sense of invincibility will shatter. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bounces between Mark\u2019s home and Japan, where the Pride Fighting Championship takes place. That\u2019s where Mark, a much-celebrated champion, is taken down by an illegal but nevertheless humbling move. After the fact, the match is ruled a tie, but the stink of defeat never dissipates.",
      "The real battle, in any case, is at home. Mark\u2019s dependence on opioids for the punishing extremes he endures is becoming desperate. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is based on John Hyams\u2019s 2002 documentary of the same name, and part of the nature of that film was the curiosity of Mark\u2019s extreme violence in the ring and his otherwise sweet passivity. In Safdie\u2019s film, Mark is asked in the doctor\u2019s waiting room if fighters hate each other during a bout. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he replies.",
      "But while we don\u2019t doubt Mark\u2019s sincerity \u2014 he\u2019s as earnest as he is muscle-bound \u2014 Johnson also exudes an inner turmoil, and a struggle to keep his rage at bay while nursing mounting wounds to his ego. His body is so stiff, it\u2019s like he could snap at any moment.",

They feud often, sometimes immediately before a match, sometimes over how to make his shakes. When he tries to give up opioids, he takes her late-night drinking as a provocation. \u201cTreat me like a man,\u201d he tells her.",
      "It\u2019s an awkward, perhaps judgmental characterization that would be all the more glaring if it weren\u2019t for Blunt\u2019s tact as a performer. But it throws \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d off course, especially when the movie seems to want to lean more on its other central relationship: that of Mark and his friend, trainer and sometimes competitor Mark Coleman (played by former Bellator champion Ryan Bader).",
      "In his films with his brother, Safdie has long brought real-life figures into their movie worlds, blurring fictional boundaries. Bader gives \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d a dose of documentary in his presence, but I\u2019d argue that Johnson\u2019s proximity to this world gives the movie its most compelling real-life echoes.",
      "I happen to think Johnson is also very good in full movie-star mode, especially when he has the chance to wryly undercut his big-screen presence in comedies like \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\u201d or \u201cThe Tooth Fairy.\u201d But it\u2019s also captivating to see him so thoroughly settled into a character like he is in \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d while totally shorn of his charisma.",
      "Yet the potency of that performance is let down by a movie that fails to really grapple with the violent world around Mark, resorting instead for a blander appreciation of these MMA combatants. What does resonate, though, is the portrait of a human colossus who learns to accept defeat \u2014 a mountain of a man who looks like he could, without barely trying, rip someone\u2019s head off at any moment. Instead he takes a deep breath, and doesn\u2019t.",

      "NEW YORK -- In 1983, six thieves muscled their way into a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, expecting to find a large sum of foreign currency. They got much more than they bargained for \u2014 26 million pounds worth of gold bars.",
      "What happened in the days and years next is the subject of PBS\u2019 \u201cMasterpiece\u201d enthralling series \u201cThe Gold,\u201d which traces the ripple effects of Britain's biggest robbery, going from a local search to infiltrating an international money laundering cartel. It starts airing Sunday.",
      "\u201cFrom the minute the show starts, the pressure's on,\u201d says showrunner Neil Forsyth. \u201cThere\u2019s a clock ticking, there\u2019s a net tightening and all these things. So it\u2019s lovely to write characters under that continual pressure.\u201d",
      "The so-called Brinks-Mat heist rocked Britain, leading to changes in banking laws, policing and shining a light on official corruption. Much of the gold was never located. It was melted down and sold back into the financial system, with the proceeds laundered into real estate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s literally in the bricks and mortar and the architecture that surrounds people everywhere,\u201d says Emun Elliott, who plays one of the detectives. \u201cThere might be a piece of that stolen gold in your wedding ring. It is everywhere.\u201d",
      "To tell the sprawling story of \u201cThe Gold,\u201d Forsyth streamlined timelines, combined real-life figures and adjusted events to fit the drama. Viewers are told the series was \u201cinspired by real events.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a strict factual drama,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t find that a very attractive route to go down creatively because I like having the space to create and that\u2019s extremely important if you\u2019re going to create something that\u2019s truly entertaining, truly gripping.\u201d",
      "One real person who is portrayed in the series is Brian Boyce, the principled and determined lead investigator, played by \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d star Hugh Bonneville.",
      "Boyce \u201cwas known to be a safe pair of hands,\u201d says Bonneville, who met the retired officer to prepare for the role. Boyce knew some officers in the department were corrupt and picked a lean, insular team to track down the gold and money.",
      "\u201cHe absolutely was adamant that not on his watch would police corruption thrive,\u201d Bonneville says. \u201cHe\u2019s a real man of integrity and I think that comes through. You\u2019ve got him against all odds trying to steer a level course and get this job done.\u201d",
      "Forsyth says the series' first episode attracted some 10 million viewers in the U.K. \u2014 or 1 in 5 of the adult population. He says he was in a restaurant with his wife once when the nearby table spent the whole meal discussing it, which was \u201csomewhat unnerving.\u201d",
      "Forsyth was only 5 and living in Scotland at the time of what he calls the \u201ciconic heist.\u201d Despite its impact on British society, no one had pieced it all together in a dramatization or an all-encompassing documentary until now.",

      "Eight years ago, the great Daniel Day-Lewis said he was finished with acting",
      "It is often said of our greatest actors that they could compellingly recite the phone book.",
      "There's no doubt, just to continue that thought for a moment, that Daniel Day-Lewis is one of our greatest living actors \u2014 perhaps truly the best of them all. And so the first and most important thing to say about \u201cAnemone,\u201d a bleak, somber, absorbing but also sometimes frustratingly opaque collaboration with his director son Ronan, is that it's brought Day-Lewis back. He told us eight years ago that he was done with acting, and we hoped he was exaggerating. At least for now, it seems he was.",
      "As for the phone book: Well, there\u2019s a moment here where you might wish that was indeed the content you were hearing. In one of two remarkable monologues that punctuate a movie otherwise spare with words, Day-Lewis, playing a bitter and lonely recluse, lets loose an anecdote so shockingly scatological and epically disgusting \u2014 the script is co-written by father and son, by the way \u2014 that it\u2019s hard to erase from one\u2019s mind (still trying, here). Somehow, he makes it more fascinating than revolting \u2014 but it\u2019s a Herculean task, something Day-Lewis the actor is obviously no stranger to.",
      "The film's title refers to a flower that we briefly see growing in the lush woodlands where we find Day-Lewis\u2019 character, Ray, eking out the sparest of existences. The father-son writers take their time explaining why exactly Ray has consigned himself to this solitary life, but we get a key hint in the first frames of the film \u2014 violent kids\u2019 drawings, with stick figures carrying long guns, and severed limbs.",
      "We soon learn that both Ray and brother Jem (Sean Bean) were British soldiers, veterans of the early days of the Northern Ireland troubles. They're also victims of a violent childhood in care homes.",
      "But they haven't seen each other in two decades, their bond torn asunder by some unrevealed trauma that led them to each seek comfort \u2014 or absolution \u2014 in different places. Jem has found it in strict religious practice, and home life with Nessa, Ray's former partner, and Brian, their son.",
      "It is teenager Brian\u2019s deepening troubles that have spurred Jem to seek out his brother in the lush but forbidding woods, where Ray leads an ascetic life devoted to the most basic human survival. Ronan Day-Lewis, a painter making his feature directorial debut, is at his best in creating, along with cinematographer Ben Fordesman, a sense of the unpredictability of nature, culminating in a dramatic hailstorm.",

We know that Jem has brought with him a letter from Nessa (Samantha Morton), that Ray at first does not read. But the brothers connect, slowly, in mundane activities like brushing their teeth, swimming in the ocean, or dancing wildly together.",
      "The words do come tumbling when Ray relates his tale of how he wrought revenge upon a priest who repeatedly molested him as a child. This bracing monologue \u2014 in which he describes defecating on the man in sickening detail \u2014 is only a precursor to an extraordinary speech later in the film that is vintage Day-Lewis, a searing account of the life-altering moment he killed a young boy. \u201cI don\u2019t need your absolution,\u201d he snarls to his brother, when the latter tries to veer him away from the guilt and shame that have crippled him for 20 years.",
      "But clearly Ray does need some sort of absolution, and his confession to his brother is that first step.",
      "Will Ray find a way to come in from the cold and reconnect with his son? The artistic parallels are a little too neat to ignore \u2014 a son bringing Day-Lewis the actor back into view, for the benefit of us all.",
      "Will he stay? Let\u2019s hope that even if Day-Lewis assures us anew that he's finished, he'll once again be exaggerating.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats believe health care is an issue that resonates with a majority of Americans as they demand an extension of subsidies in exchange for their votes to reopen the shuttered U.S. government. But it is also one of the most intractable issues in Congress \u2014 and a real compromise amid the government shutdown will not likely be easy, or quick.",
      "There are some Republicans in Congress who want to extend the higher subsidies, which were first put in place in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as millions of people who receive their insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are set to receive notices that their premiums will increase at the beginning of the year. But many GOP lawmakers are strongly opposed to any extension \u2014 and see the debate as a new opportunity to cut back on the program altogether.",
      "\u201cIf Republicans govern by poll and fail to grab this moment, they will own it,\u201d wrote Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican, in a letter published in the The Wall Street Journal over the weekend. He encouraged senators not to go \u201cwobbly\u201d on the issue.",
      "\u201cThe jig is up, the pandemic is over and my colleagues shouldn\u2019t blink in any other direction,\u201d Roy wrote.",
      "Republicans have been railing against the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, since it was enacted 15 years ago. But while they have been able to chip away at it, they have not been able to substantially alter it as a record 24 million people are now signed up for insurance coverage through the ACA, in large part because billions of dollars in subsidies have made the plans more affordable for many people.",
      "Now, some of them see the Democrats\u2019 fight as their chance to revisit the issue \u2014 putting Republican congressional leaders and President Donald Trump in a complicated position as the government shutdown enters its seventh day and hundreds of thousands of federal workers are going unpaid.",
      "\u201cI am happy to work with Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to reopen,\u201d Trump wrote on social media Monday night, walking back earlier comments saying there were ongoing negotiations with Democrats.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly indicated that Republicans are open to extending the subsidies, with reforms, if Democrats would reopen the government. But he has refused to negotiate until that happens \u2014 and has suggested Trump will be key to the eventual outcome.",
      "Thune told reporters Monday \u201cthere may be a path forward\u201d on ACA subsidies, but stressed, \u201cI think a lot of it would come down to where the White House lands on that.\u201d",
      "Many GOP senators argue the only path forward is to overhaul the law. \u201cThe whole problem with all of this is Obamacare,\u201d said Florida Sen. Rick Scott.",
      "Most House Republicans agree, and House Speaker Mike Johnson has been noncommittal on discussions.",
      "\u201cObamacare is not working,\u201d Johnson said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re trying to fix it.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments in its latest LGBTQ+ rights case Tuesday, weighing the constitutionality of bans passed by nearly half of U.S. states on the practice known as conversion therapy for children.",
      "The justices are hearing a lawsuit from a Christian counselor challenging a Colorado law that prohibits therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation or gender identity. Kaley Chiles, with support from President Donald Trump's Republican administration, argues the law violates her freedom of speech by barring her from offering voluntary, faith-based therapy for kids.",
      "Colorado, on the other hand, says the measure simply regulates licensed therapists by barring a practice that's been scientifically discredited and linked to serious harm.",
      "The arguments come months after the Supreme Court's conservative majority found states can ban transition-related health care for transgender youths, a setback for LGBTQ rights. The justices are also expected to hear a case about sports participation by transgender players this term.",
      "Colorado has not sanctioned anyone under the 2019 law, which exempts religious ministries. State attorneys say it still allows any therapist to have wide-ranging, faith-based conversations with young patients about gender and sexuality.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\u201d Colorado state attorneys wrote.",
      "Therapy isn't just speech, they said \u2014 it's health care that governments have a responsibility to regulate. Violating the law carries potential fines of $5,000 and license suspension or even revocation.",
      "Linda Robertson is a Christian mom of four from Washington state whose son Ryan underwent therapy that promised to change his sexual orientation after he came out to her at age 12. The techniques led him to blame himself when it didn\u2019t work, leaving him ashamed and depressed. He died in 2009, after multiple suicide attempts and a drug overdose at age 20.",
      "\u201cWhat happened in conversion therapy, it devastated Ryan\u2019s bond with me and my husband,\" she said. \u201cAnd it absolutely destroyed his confidence he could ever be loved or accepted by God.\u201d",
      "Chiles contends her approach is different from the kind of conversion therapy once associated with practices like shock therapy decades ago. She said she believes \u201cpeople flourish when they live consistently with God\u2019s design, including their biological sex,\" and she argues evidence of harm from her approach is lacking.",
      "Chiles says Colorado is discriminating because it allows counselors to affirm minors coming out as gay or identifying as transgender but bans counseling like hers for young patients who may want to change their behavior or feelings. \u201cWe're not saying this counseling should be mandatory, but if someone wants the counseling they should be able to get it,\u201d said one of her attorneys, Jonathan Scruggs.",

The group also represented a Christian website designer who doesn\u2019t want to work with same-sex couples and successfully challenged a Colorado anti-discrimination law in 2023.",
      "The group's argument in the conversion therapy case also builds on another victory from 2018: A Supreme Court decision found California could not force state-licensed anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion. Chiles should also be free from that kind of state regulation, the group argued.",
      "Still, the Supreme Court has also found that regulations that only \u201cincidentally\u201d burden speech are permissible, and the state argues that striking down its law against conversion therapy would undercut states' ability to regulate discredited health care of all kids.",

      "Before this year, U.S. health officials \u2014 following recommendations by infectious disease experts \u2014 recommended annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older. The idea was to update protection against the coronavirus as it continues to evolve.",

      "Experts say a food aid program that helps 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money unless the government shutdown ends within two weeks",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A food aid program that helps more than 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money within two weeks unless the government shutdown ends, forcing states to use their own money to keep it afloat or risk it shutting down, experts say.",
      "The $8 billion Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, also known as WIC, provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples that are often out of financial reach for low-income households.",
      "The shutdown, which began Wednesday, coincided with the beginning of a new fiscal year, meaning programs like WIC, which rely on annual infusions from the federal government, are nearly out of money. Currently, the program is being kept afloat by an $150 million contingency fund, but experts say it could run dry quickly.",
      "After that, states could step in to pay for the program and seek reimbursement when a budget finally passes, but not all states say they can afford to do so.",
      "\u201cWe feel good about one to two weeks,\u201d said Ali Hard, policy director for the National WIC Association. \u201cAfter that, we are very worried.\u201d",
      "Taylor Moyer, a mother of three who recently separated from her husband, has been receiving WIC since her first son was born nine years ago. She said the program allowed her to feed her children nutritious food that tends to be pricier than calorie-dense, processed options. It also provided guidance when she struggled to breastfeed and counseled her on how to handle her son's picky eating stage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been times where I have sat back in my house and really wondered how I was going to feed my family,\u201d said Moyer, who works at the LGBT Life Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia. \u201cAnd I went to the store with my WIC card ... I get rice, I got avocados, I got eggs, and I made a balanced meal that was actually good.\u201d",
      "The shutdown came as Democrats and Republicans failed to pass a new spending plan. Democratic lawmakers want to extend tax credits that make health care cheaper for millions of Americans, and they want to reverse deep cuts to Medicaid that were passed earlier this year. They refused to sign on to any spending plan that did not include those provisions.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, blamed Democrats for the shutdown and called them hypocritical because failing to fund the federal government endangers so many health programs.",
      "The WIC program, which has long had bipartisan support, aids those who are pregnant, mothers and children under age 5. Research has tied it to lower infant mortality, healthier birth weights, higher immunization rates and better academic outcomes for children who participate. Nearly half of those who are eligible don't enroll, often because they believe they don't qualify or they can't reach a WIC office.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers want to cut WIC, which is targeted for elimination in Project 2025, the influential policy blueprint authored by the man who's now President Donald Trump\u2019s budget chief. Trump\u2019s budget request and the spending plan backed by House Republicans would not fully fund the program. They also want to cut funding for families to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "In the event of an extended shutdown, several states have sought to reassure WIC recipients that they will continue to receive benefits. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said the state will pick up the tab if federal funding runs out.",

      "A nonprofit group in Miami is helping reduce the strain on emergency rooms by providing homeless people with health care where they live",
      "MIAMI -- MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Jonas Richards became homeless several years ago after losing his job as a truck driver. Despite suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes, seeing a doctor hasn't been a major priority since then.",
      "\u201cWhen you're homeless, it's not easy,\u201d Richards said. \u201cYou find yourself hustling, trying to keep a little money in your pocket, trying to find something to eat.\u201d",
      "But Richards recently had his first visit with doctors from Miami Street Medicine while sitting on a curb outside a homeless shelter.",
      "\u201cYou get everything done right here very fast,\u201d Richards said. \u201cIt was a big help.\u201d",
      "Miami Street Medicine is a nonprofit organization providing free mobile health care services to homeless people. It\u2019s part of a larger group, Dade County Street Response, which also includes a free clinic called Doctors Within Borders, a disaster relief team and a mental health crisis line.",
      "Miami Street Medicine teams of paid staff and medical school student volunteers aren\u2019t just bandaging cuts and handing out aspirin. They\u2019re performing intake on patients with tablet computers and offer follow-up visits for chronic conditions. They're working with specialists like dermatologists, neurologists and cardiologists.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out there to meet the needs of our patients,\u201d founder Dr. Dan Bergholz said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s a cough drop, we\u2019ve got you. We are happy to help you with that cough drop. But really the mission is so much greater. It\u2019s showing that we care, and we\u2019re there for them. So when that cough becomes pneumonia, they\u2019ll let us listen to their lungs and maybe trust us to take them to the hospital.\u201d",
      "Bergholz began laying groundwork for Miami Street Medicine about seven years ago. He said he had started doing charity outreach with homeless people as an undergraduate, but it seemed like more could be done.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like we weren\u2019t quite moving the needle for folks,\u201d Bergholz said.",
      "After learning more about the growing trend of street medicine and being accepted to the University of Miami\u2019s medical school, Bergholz began working with other students to set up a program.",
      "\u201cI moved down to Miami early and just started hitting the streets and chatting with people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could call it a needs assessment.\u201d",
      "Just as Miami Street Medicine was taking off, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and forced the group to adjust. Bergholz connected with Dade County Street Response to provide health care to more underserved areas.",

      "\u201cA sort of bigger vision emerged to fill the gaps in the local social safety net,\u201d Bergholz said.",
      "One challenge is the transient nature of homeless people, which makes it difficult to provide continual care. Dr. Armen Henderson, founder of Dade County Street Response, said the problem is compounded by laws that target homeless people.",
      "\u201cThe criminalization of homelessness has significantly impacted our patients\u2019 ability to be in one place to get services,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cFor the street medicine team, they know they meet us in one place. But if the majority of those patients are now ending up in jail, now the people are trying to figure out what places are police not harassing them.\u201d",
      "Another challenge is fighting the common sentiment that providing services actually increases homelessness, Henderson said.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that ends homelessness is easy access to housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that encourages people to be unsheltered. No one wants to be unsheltered. So by offering services like this, we\u2019re actually trying to ease people\u2019s suffering. When people come in here, they want to get off the street. They want to figure out a plan.\u201d",
      "Members of Miami Street Medicine have noticed more people losing their homes in recent years as prices increase and wages remain stagnant. Dr. Inaki Bent, who oversees street medicine teams, said he\u2019s also seen an increase in undocumented migrants on the streets as the state and federal governments have expanded immigration enforcement this year.",
      "\u201cI see patients here who are no longer working,\u201d Bent said. \u201cThey\u2019re no longer working because the fields and the construction sites have become targets. And they would prefer not to be employed or not to expose themselves to that risk.\u201d",
      "In addition to the individual benefit to patients, providing medical treatment on the street and at the group's clinic prevents treatable conditions from becoming emergencies that ultimately strain the entire health care system. For example, Bent had a patient who had previously been treated for seizures at an emergency room and received a prescription, but couldn't afford it. The patient would have eventually ended up back in the ER, but Miami Street Medicine paid for his medicine.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re able to fill that void and hopefully prevent a couple more admissions,\u201d Bent said. \u201cBut we're also able to do a human service for him, for our fellow man, to provide him with the necessary health care so he can begin his path toward a productive life.\u201d",

(AP) \u2014 New Mexico lawmakers moved quickly Thursday at a special legislative session to prop up funding for food assistance and rural health care services in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to federal spending on Medicaid and nutrition programs.",
      "The Democratic-led Legislature sent a flurry of bills to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham that include more than $16 million to sustain food assistance under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and additional funds to bolster food banks, as the federal government ends SNAP eligibility for many noncitizens and changes benefit calculations for others.",
      "\u201cWe need to act to make sure that New Mexicans don't go hungry with SNAP changes at the federal level,\u201d Democratic state Sen. George Mu\u00f1oz of Gallup said.",
      "Another $50 million would help sustain medical services at rural health clinics and hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid spending.",
      "Republicans in the legislative minority voted in unison against the spending provisions, arguing big Medicaid changes are still far away and that New Mexico should focus on reducing errors in benefit distributions.",
      "At the same time, Democrats and some GOP legislators voted to backfill subsidies to health insurance on New Mexico\u2019s Affordable Health Care exchange in case federal credits are allowed to expire. The federal subsidies are a major sticking point of the budget standoff in Washington that prompted the federal government shutdown Wednesday.",
      "In a news release, Lujan Grisham said she'll sign the bills to protect families from being priced out of insurance and ensure health care services are provided in small communities.",
      "Many federal health care changes under Trump's big bill don\u2019t kick in until 2027 or later, and Democratic legislators in New Mexico acknowledged that their bills are only a temporary bandage.",
      "\u201cSome of the most significant (federal) cuts are delayed a few years, and these are deeply significant,\u201d said state Rep. Nathan Small of Las Cruces, lead sponsor of the spending bill. \u201cI want to make sure that we\u2019re all thinking of, not hundreds of millions, but billions of dollars of reduced Medicaid support to our state.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s big bill is prompting urgent action in several Democratic states, but not in Republican ones.",

Pat Woods, a Republican from the state\u2019s sparsely populated eastern plains, co-sponsored changes to rural health care grants aimed at shoring up existing health care services at rural clinics and hospitals.

Who the hell knows,\u201d Woods told a panel of state lawmakers. \u201cWhat I worry about is keeping these clinics and hospitals open until the dust settles.\u201d",

      "The idea of meditating can be intimidating to beginners",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea of meditating can be intimidating. Beginners may imagine sitting uncomfortably in silence while breathing deeply and scrubbing all thoughts from their minds. The prospect of trying those techniques at work may feel embarrassing.",
      "But there are ways to bring short, inconspicuous sessions into the workday if you want to see if meditation can help you deal with challenging customers or reduce anxiety while preparing for a presentation. And experienced practitioners say there's no right or wrong way to do it.",
      "\u201c Meditation is quite easy, as a matter of fact. I think there\u2019s a stigma around it, that you have to be in complete silence, and you have to have some room setup, or do some chanting, or some serious breathing,\u201d said Michelle Beyer, a wellness coach who owns the Brooklyn women\u2019s gym Alana Life & Fitness. \u201cThere\u2019s one-minute meditations you can do to make yourself feel great. Nobody will even know you\u2019re doing them.\"",
      "While there are different meditation techniques, many traditions encourage focusing on breathing to help calm the mind. When thoughts pop up, imagine letting them go. Practitioners say meditating before or at work helps them maintain focus, sit still and reduce stress.",
      "\u201cThere is a calm that I am definitely missing when I have forgotten to do it for a few days,\u201d said Brianna Healy, who meditates for 10 minutes daily before starting her job as assistant director of strategic initiatives and data solutions at Naropa University, a college in Boulder, Colorado, that is inspired by Buddhist principles. \u201cI can always tell the difference in my demeanor.\"",
      "If you feel pressed for time, try fitting meditation sessions into breaks. You can set a timer and focus on breathing while sitting at a desk, in a restroom, inside a vehicle or outside, Beyer said.",
      "Here are some easy mini-meditations to try out on the job.",
      "Commuters can consider getting to work a little early and taking a pause in their cars or a quiet location to decompress from getting out the door and to your destination, said Kathryn Remati, a meditation teacher and author of \u201cBefriend Yourself.\u201d If you only have a minute or two, that's still enough time to try Remati's instructions for a quick reset.",
      "Close your eyes and take a long, slow, deep breath to fill your tummy and lungs with air, she said. Hold the breath for a second, and then slowly breathe out like you're blowing out a candle. \"You\u2019ll immediately feel a shift and you\u2019ll feel like a human again,\u201d Remati said.",
      "While repeating that process, consider setting a positive intention, or goal, for the day. Instead of focusing on a to-do list, think about how you want behave towards others, she said. Some intention examples are, \u201cToday I\u2019m going to be productive, but I\u2019m also going to a good listener\u201d or \u201cI want to have a positive attitude,\u201d she said.",
      "Visualization is another technique that experienced meditators use. Picture yourself succeeding at the challenges you\u2019ll encounter that day. If there\u2019s an upcoming deadline, envision yourself finishing the task 10 minutes early. Jumping for joy. Get specific like a movie director and imagine the colors in the room or the feeling of wind on your face, Remati said.",
      "Throughout the day, \u201cyou can bring up that image anytime you need it to refocus,\u201d she said.",
      "You can also use visualization to reframe your perspective on colleagues or clients. A technique Remati recommends putting into practice before meetings may seem quirky: Envision a white light over the meeting room's doorway that showers the people entering with brightness. Remati says it may help you imagine them in a better light. \u201cYou can even put some sort of pink bubble around people,\" she added.",
      "Another short meditation that can be done almost anywhere involves breathing deeply and mentally scanning your body for sensations, a technique popularized in the U.S. by mindfulness practitioner Jon Kabat-Zinn. Depending on your location and comfort level, you can keep your eyes open or closed.",

You can do this if you feel your stress level rising. \u201cSay to yourself, whenever I put my finger and thumb together, I will be able to be peaceful and open-minded,\u201d Remati said.",

Remati does this herself if she notices she's becoming judgmental or short-tempered. \u201cYou just do the finger and thumb, take a nice deep breath, get grounded, and then get back into the meeting and feeling positive,\u201d she said.",
      "One of Beyer's favorite techniques is best done when there aren't a lot of people nearby. Truck drivers can do it in traffic. You inhale, and then when you're breathing out, you hum with your lips closed, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's going to immediately take down stress levels in the body and even in the mind,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cWhen you inhale and you focus on humming, then your brain is focused on that, not the \u2018what ifs' or the worries that like to take over when we feel stressed.\u201d",
      "If you feel self-conscious about humming in a quiet office, you can step outside or head to a noisier place.",
      "The shoulder and jaw release technique also may help relax the bodies of train passengers or drivers or stuck in traffic, Beyer said. To start, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Repeat that, and then on the third exhale, roll your shoulders back. Inhale a fourth time and then on the next exhale relax your tongue and jaw, Beyer said. Finally, inhale again, bring your attention to your hands and just let them hang heavy, she said. Then breathe in and out a sixth time.",
      "Another technique Remati encourages is saying mantras or affirmations, which are positive statements or slogans you repeat to yourself. You can write them down and say them in your head or out loud while breathing deeply, before a meeting or at any point throughout the day.",
      "Some phrases you might say: \u201cI am calm.\" Deep breath. \u201cI am confident.\u201d Deep breath. \"I am ready for success,\u201d Remati suggested. \u201cI speak my truth. I am patient. I am here for the highest good of all.\u201d",

      "Pete Carroll returned to coaching to take on the challenge of revitalizing the Las Vegas Raiders",
      "HENDERSON, Nev. -- Pete Carroll could be just about anywhere, doing nearly anything that comes to mind, after accomplishing so much as a championship-winning coach in college and the NFL, the multimillion-dollar contracts he received as reward for such efforts.",
      "But after a year away from the NFL, the 74-year-old Carroll chose to return to take on the challenge of turning around a Las Vegas Raiders franchise that has gone more than two decades since coming close to the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cIt isn\u2019t about accomplishing things to say you were worthy,\u201d Carroll said at his introductory news conference in January. \u201cIt\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do next that counts.\u201d",
      "That appears to be a common theme for Carroll and other coaches 70 years and older. They thrive on competition, and a leisurely retirement doesn't seem to be as appealing as drawing up game plans and developing athletes.",
      "Carroll is the only NFL coach in that age range, though Kansas City's Andy Reid, at 67, isn't far behind.",
      "There are a number of other notable septuagenarians not only still coaching, but doing so at a high level.",
      "Geno Auriemma, 71, led the Connecticut women\u2019s basketball team to the NCAA title last season, the Huskies\u2019 12th under his watch.",
      "Kelvin Sampson, who turns 70 on Sunday, coached the Houston basketball team that came within a final possession of winning the national championship last season. Proven winners St. John's Rick Pitino (73), Michigan State's Tom Izzo (70) and Tennessee's Rick Barnes (71) are all back for another season.",
      "Seventy-year-old Kirk Ferentz has led Iowa football since 1999, and North Carolina is under the direction of rookie college coach Bill Belichick, the 73-year-old six-time Super Bowl champion at New England.",
      "Dusty Baker, since retired, was 73 when he managed Houston to the World Series title in 2022. Stanford women's basketball coach and Hall of Famer Tara VanDerveer retired last year at 70.",
      "Robert W. Turner II, associate professor at Duke University School of Medicine and Center of Aging, said successful older coaches have an advantage over most of the population largely because they have been well-compensated over the years.",
      "\"People are living longer, but then there are people who have means,\u201d said Turner, who played college and pro football. \u201cThose are people who are economically, educationally, environmentally have the resources to help them live healthier and longer. So as long as they have the mental acuity, there's no reason they have to pull out of the job market.\u201d",
      "Coaches aren't the only ones working later in life.",
      "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, people 50 and older make up about a third of the work force and those 65 and older account for roughly 6%.",
      "Carly Roszkowski, AARP\u2019s vice president of financial resilience, said workers 75 and older are \u201cthe fastest-growing segment of the work force,\u201d and are projected to be 11.7% of the labor market in 2030.",
      "She said falling birthrates mean that by 2034, there will be more workers 65 and older than 18 and younger, and Roszkowski added many workers fear not having adequate retirement savings.",
      "But while an AARP survey showed that 98% of older workers continued to remain employed for financial reasons, 88% also wanted \u201cto feel useful\u201d and 86% liked the idea of staying active.",
      "\u201cPeople are staying healthier longer,\u201d Roszkowski said. \u201dWe know that continuing to work has a lot of health benefits. You're staying out of that social isolation. You're staying mobile with having a job. For most people, you're commuting or going into a place. You've moving around. You're continuing to use your brain.\u201d",

      "\u201cWith those that do get the opportunity, I think there's strong evidence that they get a much shorter leash than white coaches,\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd they get fewer second, third and fourth chances than white coaches.\"",
      "Women also appear less likely to coach late in life, with someone like VanDerveer being a rarity.",
      "\"What was the size of her peer group like when she started?\u201d Turner said. \u201cThen over the years, we know that peer group she came from started to dwindle for lots of different reasons. In basketball, she's what we would call a super ager. She's been super successful. She's been able to take care of herself. But she (was) working in an environment where they appreciate her.\u201d",
      "VanDerveer captured three national championships at Stanford, won 1,216 games (behind only Auriemma) and coached the U.S. to Olympic gold in 1996.",

      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s time to get a flu vaccine, and pediatricians are urging people to get them after last winter, when the U.S. saw the most flu-related child deaths in 15 years.",
      "October is the ideal month to get protected, experts say, because flu cases typically begin climbing in November.",
      "\u201cThe best time is today. If you haven\u2019t already had it, get it. I got mine yesterday,\u201d said Dr. Laura Riley, of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",
      "Don\u2019t like shots? This year marks the first time that some people can try vaccinating themselves at home using the nasal spray vaccine FluMist.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "Just about everyone age 6 months and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and major medical societies. Despite lots of recent misinformation and confusion about vaccines, the flu recommendations haven\u2019t changed.",
      "Flu is particularly dangerous for people 65 and older, pregnant women, young children, and people of any age who have chronic health problems including asthma, diabetes, heart disease and weak immune systems.",
      "About 71% of seniors roll up their sleeves every year, but less than 50% of other adults do. Last year, just under half of children got a flu vaccine, down from over 60% a few years ago.",
      "Flu vaccines may not block all infections, but they do a really good job of preventing severe illness and hospitalization, said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Tens of thousands of Americans die from the flu every winter. But during last year\u2019s harsh season, the CDC counted 280 children who died of flu-related complications. Nearly half had no prior health problems and about 90% hadn't been fully vaccinated.",
      "Another concern from last season: The CDC counted more than 100 children who developed a rare flu complication \u2014 brain inflammation that can lead to seizures, hallucinations, or even death. Very few were vaccinated.",
      "It\u2019s important for mothers-to-be to understand that a bad case of flu can put them in the hospital or cause their baby to be born prematurely, Riley said.",

      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49.",
      "FluMist has been available for more than 20 years, but the at-home option is newly available for certain adults on the vaccine's website. If they\u2019re deemed eligible according to their age and a medical questionnaire, they\u2019ll be shipped FluMist timed to arrive on a particular day, with instructions on how to administer it to themselves or their children.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved the home administration option last year, too late to roll out for that season. It's currently only available in 34 states, according to manufacturer AstraZeneca, which hopes to expand access.",

      "Yes, said Dr. Philip Huang, director of Dallas Health and Human Services. They\u2019re safe to give together and \u201cthat's a good way to get them taken care of,\u201d he said.",

The collapse of the blink-and-you-missed-it government \u2014 with ministers out of a job before they'd even had a chance to settle in \u2014 was a bad look for Macron, bordering on farcical for his critics.",
      "It reinforced the impression that Macron \u2014 who famously described himself as \u201cthe master of the clocks,\u201d firmly in control, on his way to winning the French presidency for the first time in 2017 \u2014 is no longer in full command of France's political agenda and that his authority is ebbing away.",
      "One of Macron's loyal supporters, the just-reappointed but now outgoing ecology minister, Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher, captured the mood, posting: \u201cLike many of you, I despair of this circus.\u201d",
      "Perhaps more damaging for Macron were the reasons that Lecornu subsequently gave for his resignation, in an address on the front steps of L\u2019H\u00f4tel de Matignon, the 18th century office of France's prime ministers that, at this rate, may soon need fitting with a revolving door.",
      "The 39-year-old Lecornu explained that the job Macron had given him less than one month ago, after the French leader's previous prime minister was tossed out by a National Assembly vote, had proven to be impossible.",
      "Lecornu said three weeks of negotiations with political parties from across the political spectrum, unions and business leaders had failed to build consensus behind France's top domestic priority: agreeing on a budget for the country for next year.",
      "\u201cBeing prime minister is a difficult task, doubtless even a bit harder at the moment, but one cannot be prime minister when the conditions aren't fulfilled,\u201d Lecornu said.",
      "When the snap legislative elections called by Macron backfired, delivering a hung Parliament since July 2024, the French leader held to the belief that his centrist camp could continue to govern effectively, despite having no stable majority, by building alliances in the National Assembly.",
      "But the voting mathematics in the 577-seat chamber have been a recipe for turmoil, with lawmakers broadly split into three main blocs \u2014 left, center and far-right \u2014 and none with enough seats to form a government alone.",
      "France, unlike Germany, the Netherlands and some other countries in Europe, doesn't have a tradition of political coalitions governing together.",
      "Macron's political opponents in the National Assembly, particularly those on the far-left and far-right, have been in no mood to play ball.",
      "Despite their own bitter ideological differences, they have repeatedly teamed up against the president's prime ministers and their minority governments, toppling them one after another \u2014 and now seemingly convincing Lecornu that he'd be next to fall if he didn't resign first.",

      "Francine the calico cat is back home at a Lowe's store in Virginia after going missing for a few weeks, hitching a ride on a truck that turned up at a sister facility in another state.",
      "Two employees from a Lowe\u2019s in Richmond made the 90-minute drive early Monday to pick up Francine, who disappeared in September and recently was discovered at the company\u2019s distribution center in Garysburg, North Carolina.",
      "She was back on the job Tuesday, playing with customers, posing for photos and soaking in affection.",
      "\u201cFrancine is one of us,\" store supervisor Wayne Schneider said in a telephone interview. \"She\u2019s just amazing. What she means here to the store and the employees, you really can\u2019t imagine the outpouring that the employees and also the customers give her daily.\u201d",
      "Francine spends much of her time either at the customer service desk or in the store's seasonal area. But things went awry in September as the store brought in items for the upcoming Christmas season. Store general manager Mike Sida said that disruption may have prompted Francine to seek comfort elsewhere.",
      "After store employees hadn't seen Francine for a few days, they reviewed past surveillance video. There were glimpses of her in the appliance section and then the receiving department, where she darted into a truck. An overnight manager is then seen shutting the truck's door and off it went to Garysburg, about 85 miles (137 kilometers) to the south.",
      "\u201cAnd then, of course, when she got down to the distribution center, she shot off the truck,\u201d Sida said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we found out where she was and she was missing.\u201d",
      "An animal control office set up humane traps at the distribution center, where photos of Francine were posted throughout.

    "story": [
      "A Catholic bishop in Peru\u2019s Amazon is warning that mercury from illegal gold mining is contaminating rivers, fish and people across the region",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) \u2014 As gold prices hover at record highs, a leading Catholic leader in Peru\u2019s Amazon is urging countries that are destinations for the precious metal to help stem illegal mining that is poisoning rivers with mercury.",
      "Miguel \u00c1ngel Cadenas, an Augustinian from Spain who has lived in Peru\u2019s Amazon for three decades, said illegal mining has surged since the COVID-19 pandemic, citing the Tigre, Nanay, Napo and Putumayo rivers as some areas where communities are at risk.",
      "Tests have found mercury levels in some fish above World Health Organization limits, and hair samples from local residents analyzed by scientists and doctors also showed elevated concentrations.",
      "\u201cWe are in a delicate situation,\u201d Cadenas told The Associated Press. \u201cGiven that the Amazonian diet is rich in fish, we are talking about food insecurity.\u201d",
      "Mercury is widely used to separate gold during small-scale mining. It contaminates water, accumulates in fish, and builds up in people\u2019s bodies, leading to neurological and developmental harm. Cadenas said the health risks are especially acute in the Amazon, where medical services are scarce.",
      "Research in Peru\u2019s Madre de Dios region found that 43% of women of childbearing age had mercury levels above WHO safety limits, while hair samples in villages along Peru\u2019s Amazon riverways showed nearly 80% of residents exceeded the threshold.",
      "\u201cThe majority of people do not understand what is happening. There is barely any information,\u201d Cadenas said. \u201cThe state should first provide good information to its own population and then sources of food that allow other alternatives \u2014 which do not exist.\u201d",
      "Gold prices are soaring \u2014 analysts expect them to average around $3,675 per ounce by late 2025 with possible gains toward $4,000 by 2026, according to JPMorgan.",
      "Analysts say weak traceability systems make it easier for illegally mined gold to slip into global markets. Reports from Switzerland and sustainability researchers focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards say gold tainted with mercury in places like the Amazon is often laundered through refineries before entering jewelry, electronics or national reserves.",
      "Cadenas, who served as a missionary and bishop before being appointed in 2021 to lead the Apostolic Vicariate of Iquitos, stressed that Peru cannot handle the problem alone.",
      "\u201cAs long as the price of gold continues to rise, it is very difficult for a national government to manage this situation,\u201d he said. He pointed to gold-buying nations including China, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.",
      "\u201cThe first responsibility should be that those countries buying gold require traceability, so that it is not possible to pass illegal gold into legality so easily,\u201d he said.",
      "Cadenas also warned of growing violence, especially against local environmental defenders in the Amazon region.",

      "\u201cThere are people who are being threatened with death, and this seems extremely serious to me,\u201d he said, citing reports that illegal miners in remote areas are tied to armed groups, including Colombian FARC dissidents.",
      "Peru has at times tried to rein in illegal mining and mercury use. In 2019 it launched Operation Mercury, a military-police crackdown that sharply reduced deforestation in the La Pampa mining zone, though much of the activity later shifted elsewhere. Authorities also announced record seizures of contraband mercury, including a four-ton shipment at Callao port this year.",
      "Still, Indigenous groups say enforcement is inconsistent, and regional governments across the Amazon warn that cross-border smuggling of mercury continues to fuel illegal mining.",
      "The city of Iquitos hosted the Amazon Water Summit last week, which the vicariate helped organize. Roughly 400 people from Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil took part in 14 workshops on topics including water and extractivism, climate change and education.",
      "Cadenas noted that Loreto, Peru\u2019s largest Amazonian department, has the country\u2019s lowest access to drinking water \u2014 with about 60% of the population lacking potable water and sanitation. Peru\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled two years ago that this amounted to an \u201cunconstitutional state of affairs,\u201d but he said the judgment has yet to be fulfilled.",

      "Gold futures rose above $4,000 per ounce for the first time on Tuesday, as many investors seek a \u201csafe haven\u201d for to park their money as the U.S. government shutdown continues",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Gold futures rose above $4,000 per ounce for the first time on Tuesday as many investors seek a \u201csafe haven\u201d for to park their money as the U.S. government shutdown continues.",
      "Gold futures in New York briefly jumped above the $4,000 mark just after 9 a.m. ET, a record high. The going price for New York spot gold had previously closed at $3,960.60 per troy ounce \u2014 the standard for measuring precious metals \u2014 Monday.",
      "Gold sales can rise sharply when anxious investors seek secure investments for their money. Before Tuesday, the asset \u2014 and other metals, like silver \u2014 had seen wider gains over the last year, particularly with President Donald Trump \u2019s barrage of tariffs plunging much of the world into economic uncertainty.",
      "Gold futures are up about 50% since the start of 2025 \u2014 trading at around $4,003 per troy ounce as of around 9:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday, before falling back just under the $4,000 mark before 10 a.m. ET. That's up from around $2,670 seen at the beginning of January.",
      "A lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying metals like gold typically spikes when investors become anxious.",
      "Much of the recent economic turmoil has spanned from Trump\u2019s trade wars. Since the start of 2025, steep new tariffs the president has imposed on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world have strained businesses and consumers alike \u2014 pushing costs higher and weakening the job market. As a result, hiring has plunged while inflation continues to inch back up. And more and more consumers are expressing pessimism about the road ahead.",
      "The current U.S. government shutdown has added to those anxieties. Key economic data has been delayed \u2014 and scores of federal employees are already feeling the effects of furloughs and working without pay as long as the shutdown lasts, which has no immediate end in sight. Trump has also threatened to use the shutdown to dole out mass firings and perhaps permanently shutter offices in attempt to punish Democrats for voting down GOP legislation.",
      "The scope of impact could come down to how long the impasse lasts. Wall Street, meanwhile, has largely been unmoved by the shutdown so far \u2014 but Treasury yields dropped after discouraging hiring data from ADP Research Wednesday.",

      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors over time. Analysts have previously pointed to strong gold demand from central banks around the world \u2014 including amid rising geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "Advocates of investing in gold call it a \u201csafe haven\u201d \u2014 arguing the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.",
      "Still, experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. And not everyone agrees gold is a good investment. Critics say gold isn\u2019t always the inflation hedge many say it is \u2014 and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up \u2014 meaning \u201cwhen economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers.\u201d",
      "And even gold\u2019s current rally has seen some volatility. While still up significantly overall since the start of the year, there\u2019s been a handful of short stretches with losses. Gold prices fell for several days following Trump\u2019s sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement on April 2, for example.",
      "If you do choose to invest in gold, the commission says, it\u2019s important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market.",

      "Fico didn\u2019t gave more details but his government had approved a plan last year for a 1,200-megawatt nuclear unit at the site where the dominant utility Slovensk\u00e9 Elektr\u00e1rn\u011b (Slovak power plants) currently operates two nuclear units.

      "Carney's second visit to the White House comes ahead of a review next year of the free trade agreement, which is critical to Canada's economy. More than 77% of Canada's exports go to the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s talk of making Canada the 51st state and his tariffs have Canadians feeling an undeniable sense of betrayal. Relations with Canada\u2019s southern neighbor and longtime ally haven\u2019t been worse.",
      "\u201cWe've had ups and downs, but this is the lowest point in relations that I can recall,\u201d said Frank McKenna, a former Canadian ambassador to the United States and current deputy chairman of TD Bank.",
      "\u201cCanadians aren't being instructed what to do; they are simply voting with their feet,\" he said. \"I talk every day to ordinary citizens who are changing their vacation plans, and I talk to large business owners who are moving reward trips away or executive business trips.

Carney has said the commitment of the U.S. to the core of USMCA means that over 85% of Canada-U.S. trade continues to be free of tariffs. He said the U.S. average tariff rate on Canadian goods is 5.6% and remains the lowest among all its trading partners.",

      "The ties between the two countries are without parallel. About $2.5 billion (nearly $3.6 billion Canadian) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. There is close cooperation on defense, border security and law enforcement, and a vast overlap in culture, traditions and pastimes.",

      "The point of the 2017 game was to highlight inequality in sports for women and girls. On that front, Youngson achieved her goal with the match becoming the subject of a documentary and landing the group in the Guinness Book of World Records.",
      "Still, something bothered Youngson as the match unfolded. Glancing at the athletes' feet, she was struck that all the women were wearing men's or boy's soccer cleats instead of gear that was designed specifically for them. The realization led her to launch IDA Sports, which makes soccer cleats for the unique athletic needs of women.",
      "\u201cThere was this real commercial gap for performance footwear for women,\u201d said Youngson, whose IDA cleats are worn by players including Washington Spirit midfielder Courtney Brown. \"As the game is growing, we\u2019re in this moment when everything\u2019s professionalizing, but the footwear wasn\u2019t really keeping pace, so I wanted to go and change that.\u201d",

Several new pro sports leagues have formed in recent years, including the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League and the 3-on-3 Unrivaled basketball league. The Women\u2019s Professional Baseball League is set to launch next year.",
      "Overall, women's sports generated global revenue of $1.88 billion in 2024 and is projected to rake in $2.35 billion this year, according to consulting firm Deloitte. Commercial revenue, including s ponsorships and merchandising sales, surpassed $1 billion globally for the first time last year.",
      "All that growth means more opportunities for women-owned brands \u2014 and a chance to reject the \u201cshrink it and pink it\u201d mentality in which companies were criticized for taking men's products and selling them to women by making them pretty rather than functional.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store that's designed to unleash more competition against a system that a jury declared an illegal monopoly.",
      "The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.",
      "Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.",
      "In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to \u201cenormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.\"",
      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. \u201cThe changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users\u2019 ability to safely download apps,\u201d Google warned.",
      "Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.",
      "In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.",
      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

      "Those commissions were the focal point of an antitrust lawsuit that video game maker Epic Games filed against Google in 2020, setting up a month-long trial in San Francisco federal court that culminated in the jury's monopoly verdict.",
      "Epic, the maker of the Fortnite game, lost a similar antitrust case targeting Apple's iPhone app store. Even though U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rodgers concluded the iPhone app store wasn't an illegal monopoly, she ordered Apple to begin allowing links to alternative payment systems as part of a shake-up that resulted in the company being held in civil contempt of court earlier this year.",
      "In a post, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney applauded the Supreme Court for clearing the way for consumers to choose alternative app payment choices \u201cwithout fees, scare screens, and friction.\u201d",
      "Although the Play Store changes will likely dent Google's profit, the company makes most of its money from a digital ad network that's anchored by its dominant search engine \u2014 the pillars of an internet empire that has been under attack on other legal fronts.",
      "As part of cases brought by the U.S. Justice Department, both Google's search engine and parts of its advertising technology were declared illegal monopolies, too.",
      "A federal judge in the search engine case earlier this year rejected a proposed break-up outlined by the Justice Department i n a decision that was widely seen as a reprieve for Google. The government is now seeking to break up Google in the advertising technology case during proceedings that are scheduled to wrap up with closing arguments on Nov. 17 in Alexandria, Virginia.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday that the government shutdown is putting more stress on air traffic controllers who already have an extremely stressful job, as well as threatening a program that small communities rely on to help subsidize airline service.",
      "Controllers are expected to continue working without a paycheck, Duffy said, so they are now worried about how to pay their bills in addition to worrying about keeping flights safe. And there have started to be instances of controllers calling out sick, leading to delays at several airports Monday.",
      "\u201cNow what they think about as they\u2019re controlling our airspace is, how am I going to pay my mortgage? How do I make my car payment? I have a couple kids at home. How do I put food on the table? I\u2019m working six days a week. Do I have to take a second job and drive Uber when I\u2019m already exhausted from doing a job that\u2019s already stressful to think about how I can make extra money because the government may not provide me a paycheck?\u201d Duffy said.",
      "Travelers at Newark Liberty International Airport, where Duffy held his news conference, said controllers should be paid for their work.",
      "\u201cEveryone should get paid for what they are doing. Of course it bothers me,\u201d said Daniel Johansson from North Carolina.",
      "A traveler from Utah, Nancy Taylor, agreed.",
      "\u201cYeah, that would be hard to work for no pay,\" Taylor said. \"But I think they understand the importance of their job. And the safety that provides to us as travelers. They need to get paid.\u201d",
      "The Transportation Department has been able to keep the air traffic controller academy in Oklahoma City open for now with funding from previous years, but Duffy is still concerned about the potential impact on efforts to hire and train new controllers in the hope of eliminating a longstanding shortage. Duffy said the support staff who train controllers after they come out of the academy could be laid off.",
      "The head of the air traffic controllers union, Nick Daniels, stayed away from political comments, but he urged Congress to end the shutdown.",

      "\u201cWe need to bring this shutdown to a close, so that the Federal Aviation Administration and the committed aviation safety professionals can put this distraction behind us, and completely focus on their vital work,\u201d Daniels said.",
      "Duffy said there has already been a small uptick in controllers calling out sick in a few places. Anytime that gets worse and creates a shortage of controllers, the FAA reduces the number of takeoffs and landings to ensure controllers aren't overwhelmed and the system remains safe. But that creates delays and possibly cancellations. Near the end of the 35-day shutdown during the first Trump administration, there were widespread flight delays because of shortages of controllers.",
      "By Monday evening, the FAA was reporting that staffing shortages were creating delays in the Burbank, Newark and Denver airports. The worst problems were in Burbank, where California Gov. Gavin Newsom said no controllers were on duty during the evening, leading to average delays of two-and-a-half hours at that airport.",
      "The Essential Air Service program that subsidizes airline service to small communities across the country will also quickly run out of money. Duffy said that program enjoys strong bipartisan support and provides an important lifeline to many small communities. It is especially important in Alaska, where flying is the only way to travel between many communities.",
      "\u201cThat money runs out this Sunday. So there\u2019s many small communities across the country that will now no longer have the resources to make sure they have air service in their community,\u201d Duffy said.",

      "It\u2019s too soon to tell for sure, but the Dubai chocolate movement seems to have put down roots and is spreading at a brisk clip. The sweet flavors and thick texture that have made Dubai chocolate bars a hit are morphing into other kinds of confections too.",
      "Let\u2019s back up for a minute. The original and now-classic Dubai chocolate bar was created by Fix Chocolatier in the United Arab Emirates in 2021, and by 2023 had exploded on social media. Rich and indulgent, it features a thick, milk chocolate shell usually encasing a creamy pistachio (and often tahini) filling mixed with crispy, shredded, phyllo-like pastry called kadayif.",
      "Global brands and small bakers alike are riffing on the concept with different flavors, translating the concept to croissants, milkshakes and more. Fillings range from peanut butter and jelly to s\u2019mores to matcha.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t call this a \u2018trend\u2019 anymore \u2014 it\u2019s a whole new thing,\u201d said Din Allall, whose family business, The Nuts Factory, has about 150 U.S. stores featuring nuts, dried fruits and candies.",

      "It's not just the flavors that make Dubai chocolate different, Allall says, but the bar's structure too \u2014 \"huge, thick, with lots of filling.\"",
      "Trader Joe\u2019s carries a Dubai chocolate bar made by Patislove. IHOP introduced a limited-time Dubai pancake stack in some locations in August. Baskin-Robbins has some Dubai-inspired ice cream products on its menu, while Costco sells a range of Dubai chocolate confections, including a Dubai chocolate cake. Walmart and QVC also sell Dubai chocolate.",

      "\u201cFor me, it\u2019s the crunch,\" said Erica Lefkowits, who was buying some Dubai chocolate recently in Dublin. \"The chocolate is soft and melty, and the filling is creamy, and then the crunch of the kadayif. It\u2019s all about the texture. Plus, it\u2019s sugar.\u201d",
      "She was a little annoyed at the price, higher than your average chocolate bar. Part of Dubai chocolate's appeal, though, is the way it feels simultaneously indulgent and worldly. Pistachios, rose, saffron and cardamom bring luxury, travel and exoticism to the chocolate party.",

      "American distillers have gotten a costly cold shoulder from Canada",
      "American distillers have gotten a costly cold shoulder from Canada, where their exports plunged 85% earlier this year \u2014 topping broad declines in key international markets amid global trade tensions, a spirits industry group said Monday.",
      "Even a thaw in trade relations may not shake this hangover right away.",
      "\u201cEven though things have eased up, we still are not back on the shelf in Canada,\u201d said Kentucky craft distiller Tom Bard. \u201cProbably won't be for a good long while.\u201d",
      "The majority of Canadian provinces continue to ban American spirits from shelves, though Canada removed its retaliatory tariff on the products weeks ago, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said. There's another nagging concern \u2014 that consumer reaction to the trade conflicts could curb the international thirst for American spirits in key markets.",
      "Overall exports of American spirits fell 9% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to a year ago, the council said in its new report. Sharp declines occurred in other crucial markets \u2014 the European Union, United Kingdom and Japan, it said. That comes on the heels of a banner year for U.S. spirits exports in 2024, the council said. Total first-quarter exports in 2025 edged up by 1% from a year ago.",
      "In the ultracompetitive spirits world, the sudden drop-off is a dispiriting development for U.S. distillers.",
      "\"There\u2019s a growing concern that our international consumers are increasingly opting for domestically produced spirits or imports from countries other than the U.S., signaling a shift away from our great American spirits brands,\u201d Chris Swonger, the council\u2019s CEO, said Monday in a release.",
      "Canada remains the only key trading partner that retaliated against U.S. spirits in the latest rounds of trade conflicts spurred by President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The president maintains that open trade cost the U.S. millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to American-made prosperity.",
      "But American distilled spirits have been a high-profile target for retaliation.",
      "Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs on European steel and aluminum spurred the EU to retaliate with a tariff that caused American whiskey exports to the EU to plunge, costing distillers more than $100 million in revenue from 2018 to 2021, the council has said. Once the tariff was suspended, EU sales rebounded for American distillers \u2014 until the latest tensions resurfaced in the first year of Trump's second term.",
      "The Distilled Spirits Council is pressing for free-flowing trade for distilled spirits with zero-for-zero tariffs with key markets, saying it would give American distillers the certainty they need.",
      "Global markets are increasingly vital for producers of American whiskey \u2014 which includes bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey. The sector faces a supply-and-demand crunch in the U.S., where a sales slowdown is coinciding with massive stockpiles of whiskey, the council said.",
      "\u201cWith the slowdown in the U.S. market, it\u2019s more important than ever for American distillers to have reliable access to international markets,\" Swonger said. \"Until these trade issues are fully resolved, many distillers are remaining on the sidelines, fearful that without a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs, they could once again face retaliatory tariffs. They simply don\u2019t want to risk jeopardizing the investments they\u2019d need to make to reestablish their presence abroad.\u201d",

      "The pain was felt across a range of spirits categories, with quarterly declines of 13% for American whiskey, 14% for vodka, 15% for cordials and 12% for brandy, it said.",
      "The declines were softened somewhat by surging sales to other countries \u2014 including Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Singapore and South Korea, the council said.",

Brown-Forman produces such brands as Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey and Woodford Reserve bourbon.",

      "Republican and Democratic lawmakers have provided few public signs of meaningful negotiations to break an impasse on reopening the federal government as the shutdown enters a sixth day",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republican and Democratic lawmakers have provided few public signs of meaningful negotiations to break an impasse on reopening the federal government as the shutdown entered its sixth day on Monday.",
      "President Donald Trump, when asked on Sunday night when federal workers would be fired as he has threatened, told reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s taking place right now, and it\u2019s all because of the Democrats.\u201d He declined to answer a question about which agencies are subject to the cuts.",
      "The possibility of layoffs escalates an already tense situation in which Washington lawmakers have struggled to find common ground and build mutual trust. Leaders in both parties are betting that public sentiment has swung their way, putting pressure on the other side to cave.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is expected to hold a Monday morning news conference at the Capitol, and others may do so as well.",
      "The House is not expected to be in session this week, focusing attention on the Senate to take the lead on any deal in the Republican-led Congress. Yet even with House lawmakers away, the Republican and Democratic leaders have been holding almost daily briefings as they frame their arguments and seek to shift blame for the shutdown.",
      "Democrats are insisting on renewing subsidies to cover health insurance costs for millions of households, while Trump wants to preserve existing spending levels as he believes that Democrats will have to fold because of the jobs and federal infrastructure and energy projects being put at risk.",
      "The stalemate comes at a moment of troubling economic uncertainty. While the U.S. economy has continued to grow this year, hiring has slowed and inflation remains elevated as the Republican president's import taxes have created a series of disruptions for businesses and hurt confidence in his leadership. At the same time, there is a recognition that the nearly $2 trillion annual budget deficit is financially unsustainable.",
      "House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, among those appearing on the Sunday news shows, said there have been no talks with Republican leaders since their White House meeting on Sept. 29. He said since then Republicans, including Trump, \u201chave gone radio silent.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration sees the shutdown as an opening to wield greater power over the budget, with multiple officials saying they will save money as workers are furloughed by imposing permanent job cuts on thousands of government workers, a tactic that has never been used before.",
      "Even though it would be Trump's choice to cut jobs, he believes he can put the blame on the Democrats because of the shutdown.",
      "Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California defended his party's stance on the shutdown, saying the possible increase in health care costs for millions of Americans would make insurance unaffordable in what he called a \u201ccrisis.\u201d",
      "But Schiff also noted that the Trump administration has stopped congressionally approved spending. That essentially undermines the value of Democrats trying to seek compromises on the budget since the administration could block the spending of money from any deal. The Trump administration sent Congress roughly $4.9 billion in what are called pocket rescissions on foreign aid, a process that meant the money was withheld without time for Congress to weigh in before the previous fiscal year ended last month.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wanting to cap Toronto's season with a title, Jeff Hoffman suggested changing hats.",
      "Six losses in seven games had dropped the Blue Jays into a tie with the New York Yankees for the AL East lead. That prompted the 32-year-old reliever to send Scott Blinn, Toronto's director of major league clubhouse operations, scrambling to find those retro caps with white panels in the style the Blue Jays wore when they won the 1992 World Series.",
      "Toronto is 5-0 in the historical headgear over the past two weeks as it takes a 2-0 lead into Tuesday night\u2019s Game 3 of the best-of-five AL Division Series against the Yankees.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t pack another hat,\u201d manager John Schneider said with a smile Monday.",
      "Following a 7-1 loss to the Red Sox at Rogers Centre on Sept. 24, Hoffman suggested to Binn a switch to the 1992 headgear, which was used during Major League Baseball\u2019s Hall of Fame weekend promotion from July 25-27 \u2014 not because he's superstitious, but because he liked the look. Wearing the white panels, the Blue Jays had taken two of three at Detroit to finish a four-game series.",
      "\u201c`We need a new combo. What should we wear?'\" Hoffman said, recounting the player discussion. \"And I said, `I know what we should wear. We should wear the blues, the blue jerseys with the white-panel hat.' And they all kind of like perked up because they didn\u2019t know I knew about them.\u201d",
      "Blinn found the caps in a Rogers Centre storage room. Toronto beat Boston 6-1 on Sept. 25, wearing blue alternate jerseys and the white-panel chapeaus. The next night, a Friday, the Blue Jays were required to wear Nike Connect uniforms topped by pitch-blue caps, suggested by Lake Ontario at night. They beat Tampa Bay 4-2 to remain tied with the Yankees.",
      "On most days, players get to decide which uniforms to wear. Given that option for the final weekend of the regular season, the Jays stuck with the blue jerseys and white-panel hats. They closed with 5-1 and 13-4 wins over the Rays to win the division on a tiebreaker over New York.",
      "Toronto finished the season 58-45 in blue caps, 20-17 in the two-tone hats with powder blue visors and navy crowns that were launched with the return of powder blue alternate jerseys in 2020, 8-3 in Nike Connect games and 5-1 in the white-panel throwbacks. They were also 1-2 in Armed Forces caps with beige camouflage crowns and olive visors from May 16-18, 1-0 in red for Canada Day on July 1 and 1-0 in light blue crowns and red visors for July 4.",

      "The new owners of the Tampa Bay Rays are promising to get hurricane-damaged Tropicana Field repaired in time for next season and beginning a search for a new, permanent ballpark to open in 2029",
      "TAMPA, Fla. -- TAMPA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The new owners of the Tampa Bay Rays are promising to get hurricane-damaged Tropicana Field repaired in time for next season and beginning a search for a new, permanent ballpark to open in 2029.",
      "The group led by Florida-based real estate developer Patrick Zalupski finalized a $1.7 billion purchase last week from Stu Sternberg, who owned the Rays for 18 years and had long sought to find the team a new stadium. Zalupski and other top executives Ken Babby and Bill Cosgrove said at a news conference Tuesday they intend for the team to remain in the Tampa Bay area.",
      "Zalupski said the search is on for a site in the region that could include roughly 100 acres (40 hectares) that would support retail shops, bars, restaurants and other amenities along with a ballpark. The stadium itself, he said, would be a domed ballpark with a fixed roof.",
      "\u201cWe need a new ballpark. I don't think that's disputed by anyone,\u201d Zalupski said. \u201cWe want to build a sustainable championship team. We're confident we can be successful in Tampa Bay.\u201d",
      "Babby, described as the team's new CEO, acknowledged there is longstanding \u201cfatigue\u201d in the area about where the Rays would build a new home \u2014 with frequent speculation they might decide to leave altogether. But MLB has repeatedly said it wants the team to stay. Several sites in the area have previously been considered, such as the nightlife-rich Ybor City neighborhood, the grounds of a Tampa community college and even an old greyhound racetrack.",
      "\u201cWe're looking at everywhere,\u201d Babby said. \u201cWe don't want to pigeonhole ourselves to one location or site.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, work continues on Tropicana Field, which had its roof ripped off and suffered significant internal damage last October during Hurricane Milton. By the end of the week, Babby said, half of the Trop's 24 roof panels will be installed.",
      "Under their current lease with the city of St. Petersburg, the Rays are obligated to play at the Trop for three more seasons. The mayors of both Tampa and St. Petersburg attended the news conference.",
      "The Rays in March withdrew from a $1.3 billion project to construct a new ballpark adjacent to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, citing the hurricane and delays that likely drove up the proposal\u2019s cost. That led Sternberg to sell the team, which had to pay the New York Yankees $15 million to play this season at the Yankees' spring training ballpark, Steinbrenner Field in Tampa.",

      "Jones' gesture came soon after Dak Prescott's fourth touchdown pass gave the Cowboys a 37-14 lead with 4:31 left in the game.",
      "\u201c(The gesture) was inadvertent on my part because that was right after we made our last touchdown, and we were all excited about it,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any antagonistic issue or anything like that. I just put up the wrong show on the hand. That was inadvertently done. I\u2019m not kidding. If you want to call it accidental, you can call it accidental. But it got straightened around pretty quick. I had a chance to look at it. It got straightened out pretty quick, but the intention was \u2018thumbs up,\u2019 and basically pointing at our fans because everybody was jumping up and down excited.\u201d",

      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The 50-plus-yard field goals that once were a rarity in the NFL are now as routine as far shorter kicks a generation ago. The range for many kickers now exceeds 60 yards, changing late-game strategy in a major way.",
      "The kicking revolution has sparked questions about whether the balls are juiced.",
      "Not quite, but there is a major difference this year, with teams now having the chance to prepare kicking balls before game day and practice with the same balls they use in games. The added length that gives kickers had Philadelphia defensive coordinator Vic Fangio comparing it to the home run explosion during baseball's steroid era starting in the late 1990s.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like they need an asterisk here,\u201d Fangio said. \"It was the live ball era or the asterisk for those home runs (Barry) Bonds and (Sammy) Sosa and (Mark) McGwire were hitting. The way they\u2019ve changed the ball, the NFL, the kicking ball has drastically changed the field goals.\"",
      "Fangio's comparison might be a bit hyperbolic, with kickers saying the more broken-in balls travel only a few yards farther, but even that could put records for long-distance field goals in jeopardy.",
      "There have already been four kicks made from at least 60 yards this season \u2014 one shy of the single-season record \u2014 with Tampa Bay's Chase McLaughlin hitting a 65-yarder against Fangio's Eagles in Week 4, just 1 yard shy of Justin Tucker's record set in 2021.",
      "Dallas' Brandon Aubrey made a 64-yarder in Week 2, and Pittsburgh's Chris Boswell and Minnesota's Will Reichard also made kicks of at least 60 yards.",
      "Fangio predicted Aubrey will eclipse the 70-yard barrier this year.",

      "Long distance kicks have become far more prevalent as the quality of kickers has improved thanks to more training and specialized coaching. The NFL has set records in each of the last four seasons for made field goals of at least 50 yards with the total reaching 195 in 2024 \u2014 doubling the total from every NFL season until 2015.",
      "Kickers are making 72.5% of field goals from at least 50 yards \u2014 nearly double the rate from three decades ago.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s definitely an advantage for specialists this year,\u201d said 49ers long snapper Jon Weeks, who is entering his 16th season in the NFL. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to see the field goal distance line back up a little bit. That\u2019s just kind of natural. It\u2019ll be exciting to see what some of these big-legged kickers can do.\u201d",
      "While the trend toward longer kicks has been a steady one the past two decades, it has increased even more so far this season following the change in rules for the \u201cK ball,\u201d with the 28 made kicks from at least 55 yards the most ever through five weeks and more than in any entire season until 2022.",
      "The change this year came after seven teams \u2014 Baltimore, Cleveland, Houston, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Minnesota and Washington \u2014 made a proposal to reduce the stress on equipment staffs on game days.",
      "Before this season, balls designated for use in the kicking game were shipped directly to the officials and brought to the stadium on game day. Teams then had a 60-minute window to prepare three kicking balls, using only a wet towel, a dry towel and a special ball brush.",

That changed following the 2006 season, with teams getting a short window on game day to prepare the balls, after Dallas quarterback Tony Romo dropped a snap as the holder on a potential game-winning field goal in a playoff loss to Seattle.",

      "It has been 20 years since the National Hockey League introduced shootouts to replace tie games, adding excitement for fans and players",
      "When Jake Oettinger attended NHL games in Minnesota growing up, he loved when the two teams playing got through regulation and overtime and then went to the shootout.",
      "\u201cYou feel like you won the lottery: You get to watch a shootout,\u201d said Oettinger, whose perspective hasn't changed much after five seasons tending goal in the league for the Dallas Stars. \u201cI see how some people are like, it\u2019s stupid, but then also it\u2019s fun. You get to be basically in the spotlight, and you get decide the game.\u201d",
      "After 5,729 ties in the NHL\u2019s first 87 seasons, a controversial change was made in 2005 to eliminate what many considered to be a relic of a bygone era of the tradition-heavy sport. In the past 20 years since, 2,486 games have gone to a shootout. Fans love the format, which is a mainstay in international compeititions like the Winter Olympics.",
      "An entire generation of players and fans have never seen a tie in an NHL game, just the 1-on-1 competition for a minimum of three rounds to ensure one side goes home with a win and the other with a loss. It is part of the fabric of hockey.",
      "\u201cIt was a big transition,\u201d said Erik Christensen, the most successful shootout specialist in league history with goals on more than half his attempts. \u201cI think if you\u2019re a true hockey fan, you can be happy with a great game that ends in a 2-2 tie. But we\u2019re in the entertainment industry, and people want to walk out of there seeing a winner and a loser.\u201d",
      "For the first decade of the shootout era, if the score was tied after the third period there was a 4-on-4 overtime period and, if no one scored, the shootout itself. At its high-water mark in 2009-10, 15% of all games reached a shootout, which was not the intent.",
      "The advent of 3-on-3 OT in 2015-16 cut that number nearly in half. Last season, a record low 5.9% of games went to shootouts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad the NHL has moved away from that, where I think the game should be more won with more of what hockey is,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cI like the way the game is played now with the 3 on 3 and deciding games that way.\u201d",
      "When there are shootouts, a lot of the moves and saves end up on highlight reels. Crowds feel like they get their money's worth.",
      "\u201cThe first couple of years, guys were going straight down \u2014 typical breakaway \u2014 and now they\u2019re showcasing their skill a lot more,\u201d said Hall of Fame goaltender Henrik Lundqvist, whose 61 shootout victories rank second all time. \u201cThey\u2019re way more creative today than they were 15 years ago.\"",
      "Lundqvist was on the losing end of a shootout with the New York Rangers on the final day of the 2009-10 season when the winner made the playoffs. Brian Boucher and Philadelphia came out on top to get in and went on a run to the Stanley Cup Final.",
      "The NHL's point format gives one apiece to each team when a game goes past regulation. An extra point is earned for winning in overtime or a shootout, and those can add up.",
      "\u201cIn the end, that could be the difference,\u201d said Lundqvist, now a TNT analyst. \u201cThey are big points. They really are. And maybe you don\u2019t feel them being that big early on in the season, but going down the stretch, you definitely feel that pressure and that\u2019s exciting.\u201d",
      "The result in the moment can also provide a huge emotional swing. Ottawa's Linus Ullmark, who won the Vezina Trophy as top goaltender in 2023 with Boston, has a love/hate relationship with the shootout for that very reason.",

      "Both were best-of-five series, so the Aces have a little more work this year with the Finals a best-of-seven for the first time if they are to win their third championship in four years.",
      "The core of those title teams remain mostly in place in four-time MVP A'ja Wilson and fellow All-Stars Jackie Young and Chelsea Gray. Jewell Loyd was a key player on two Seattle championship teams.",
      "Those players know the work is not done and any number of things can change the momentum of a series. The Aces experienced that two years ago when Gray and Kiah Stokes didn't play in the clincher because of foot injuries, though Las Vegas still eked out the win.",

      "Sabourin \u2014 who was on the ice for only 19 seconds Saturday \u2014 was given a match penalty for going after Florida defenseman Aaron Ekblad just 2:17 into the game.

      "SANTA ANA, Calif. -- SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 A wrongful-death lawsuit that accuses the Los Angeles Angels of being responsible for the 2019 drug overdose death of one of its star pitchers began Monday.",
      "Jury selection was underway in the long-awaited civil trial over whether the Major League Baseball team is responsible after one of its employees was convicted of providing drugs that led to the fatal overdose of pitcher Tyler Skaggs on a team trip to Texas.",
      "Opening statements are expected by the end of the week.",
      "The wrongful death lawsuit filed by Skaggs' widow, Carli, and his parents, alleges the Southern California team knew or should have known that its communications director, Eric Kay, was supplying drugs to Skaggs and at least six other Angels' players. Kay had a lengthy history of drug abuse and went to rehab while working for the team, which had many athletes who were playing through injuries and pain, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cEssentially, we had this wonderful human being who was a great ballplayer who was on the cusp of becoming something greater, and he was struck down at the age of 27,\u201d said the plaintiffs' lawyer Rusty Hardin. \u201cThat was caused by the Angels and their director of communications.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit also contends that Kay told federal agents two Angels employees knew about his drug dealings to players.",
      "The Angels, however, counter that despite Kay's conviction, autopsy results showed that Skaggs had also been drinking and taking oxycodone. In court filings, the team said Skaggs didn't take painkillers the way they were prescribed but snorted them while drinking alcohol, and should have known the risk of doing so.",
      "\u201cTyler was off-duty when he was in his hotel room,\u201d said Todd Theodora, an attorney for the Angels. \u201cThe team had no ability to put a guard in his room or otherwise try to prevent him from mixing the alcohol with the pills he was taking that night.\u201d",
      "Hardin said the lawsuit seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in lost potential earnings as well as for the loss the family suffered.",
      "The trial comes more than six years after the 27-year-old Skaggs was found dead in the suburban Dallas hotel room where he was staying as the Angels were supposed to open a four-game series against the Texas Rangers. A coroner\u2019s report said Skaggs had choked to death on his vomit and that a toxic mix of alcohol, fentanyl and oxycodone was found in his system.",
      "Kay was convicted in 2022 of providing Skaggs with an oxycodone pill laced with fentanyl and sentenced to 22 years in federal prison. His federal criminal trial in Texas included testimony from five Major League Baseball players who said they received oxycodone from Kay at various times from 2017 to 2019, the years he was accused of obtaining pills and giving them to Angels players.",

      "One of the winners said that quantum mechanics research already has wound up in our everyday communications. Speaking from his cellphone, Clarke said: \u201cOne of the underlying reasons that cellphones work is because of all this work.\u2019\u2019",

Clarke, who spearheaded the research team, told The Associated Press he was \"pleased to receive this prize'' alongside his two colleagues.",

She said in the past they had stayed up on the night of the physics award, but at some point they decided that sleep was more important.",
      "AP reporters were later able to speak with Martinis, once his wife decided it was late enough to wake him up.",
      "Devoret could not immediately be contacted.",
      "The prize winning research in the mid-1980s took the sub-atomic \u201cweirdness of quantum mechanics\u201d and found how those tiny interactions can have real world applications on the human scale level, said Jonathan Bagger, CEO of the American Physical Society. They have the potential to supercharge computing and communications.",
      "The 100-year-old field of quantum mechanics deals with the seemingly impossible subatomic world where switches can be on-and-off at the same time and parts of atoms tunnel through what seems like impenetrable barriers.",
      "What the three physicists did \u201cis taking the scale of something that we can\u2019t see, we can\u2019t touch, we can\u2019t feel and bringing it up to the scale of something recognizable and make it something you can build upon,\u201d said Physics Today editor-in-chief Richard Fitzgerald, who in the 1990s worked in the field on a competitors\u2019 group.",
      "The work is a crucial building block in the fast-developing world of quantum mechanics.",
      "\u201cQuantum computers is one very sort of obvious use, but they\u2019re also can be used for quantum sensors, so to be able to make very sensitive measurements of, for example, magnetic fields, and perhaps also for cryptography, so to encode information so it cannot be easily listened to by a third party,\u201d Mark Pearce, a professor of astrophysics and Nobel Physics Committee member, told The Associated Press.",
      "Quantum computing when fully achieved would be a large leap from what we now know, scientists said.",

      "Both Bagger and Fitzgerald said it\u2019s a bit of a stretch to say our everyday cellphones now use the breakthrough made by Clarke and colleagues. But ultra-sensitive measuring devices rely on that team\u2019s work and while we could have magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) without their work, it makes it far more sensitive and useful, Bagger said.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store that's designed to unleash more competition against a system that a jury declared an illegal monopoly.",
      "The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.",
      "Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.",
      "In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to \u201cenormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.\"",
      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. \u201cThe changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users\u2019 ability to safely download apps,\u201d Google warned.",
      "Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.",
      "In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.",
      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

      "STOCKHOLM -- STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \u201cMy phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: \u2018That\u2019s just, that\u2019s spam of some sort.'\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I told Mary she won, she said, \u2018don\u2019t be ridiculous,\u2019\u201d said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\u201cIt was a nice surprise,\u201d Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \u201cI hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\u201d",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they\u2019re supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi\u2019s discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014 which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too",
      "\u201cFrom a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\u201d",

      "Intrusions into NATO\u2019s airspace, some of them blamed on Russia, reached an unprecedented scale last month. Some European officials described the incidents as Moscow testing NATO\u2019s response, which raised questions about how prepared the alliance is against Russia.",
      "On Sept. 10, a swarm of Russian drones flew into Poland's airspace, forcing NATO aircraft to scramble to intercept them and shoot down some of the devices. It was the first direct encounter between NATO and Moscow since Russia launched its all-out war on Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Days later, NATO jets escorted three Russian warplanes out of Estonia\u2019s airspace.",
      "Since then, flyovers have occurred near airports, military installations and critical infrastructure, among other locations, elsewhere on the continent and prompted European defense ministers to agree to develop a \u201cdrone wall\u201d along their borders to better detect, track and intercept drones violating Europe\u2019s airspace.",
      "Russia has been blamed for some of them, but denies that anything was done on purpose or that it played a role. European authorities haven't released much detail about the drone intrusions, with some not acknowledging the overflights publicly until days later.",
      "Other times, authorities were unable to confirm a report of a sighting. At one point, Danish authorities were flooded with 500 tips of sightings over 24 hours \u2014 some of which turned out to be just stars in the sky.",

      "Germany\u2019s Munich Airport reopened Saturday morning after authorities shut it down the night before for the second time in less than 24 hours after two additional drone sightings.

      "Drones also flew over four smaller Danish airports between Sept. 24 and Sept. 25, including two that serve as military bases. Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said that a \u201cprofessional\u201c actor was likely behind the \u201dsystematic flights.\u201d",

      "In Germany, authorities are investigating claims that unidentified drones may have spied on critical infrastructure in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein. Multiple drones were spotted on Sept. 25 over a power plant in the state capital of Kiel, as well as near a university hospital and a shipyard in the port city, according to a Der Spiegel report.",

      "In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases. Opponents warned that the private equity group is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers.",

      "Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology\u2019s volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet\u2019s early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology's volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet's early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania.",
      "And now he is seeing potential signs of the cycle repeating with another transformative technology as a whirlwind of investments and excitement about artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to new highs.",
      "Chambers took a similarly meteoric ride in his early days running Cisco, which had a market value of about $15 billion in 1995, when networking equipment suddenly became must-have components for the buildup of the internet. The feverish demand briefly turned the firm into the world's most valuable company \u2014 worth $550 billion in March 2000 \u2014 before the investment bubble burst. The crash caused Cisco's stock price to plunge more than 80% during a period that Chambers still recalls as the worst of his career.",
      "Cisco bounced back to deliver consistent financial growth to help establish Chambers as one of Silicon Valley's most respected leaders before he stepped down as CEO in 2015, but company's stock price has never approached the peak it reached a quarter century ago.",
      "While remaining Cisco's chairman emeritus, Chambers is now as fascinated by the AI's transformative powers as he once was by the internet revolution. Only this time he is advising CEOs as a venture capitalist investing in AI startups rather than running a company himself. Chambers, 76, recently discussed the promise and perils of the AI boom with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "Q: Does the current AI mania remind you of the internet boom of the 1990s?",
      "A: Absolutely. There are a lot of parallels but there are also some spectacular differences. AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age. In the internet age, a startup would develop products for two years and then in year three, they would take that out into the market. Today, AI startups develop the product in a month and sometimes in a week, and then they bring it to market in one or two quarters.",
      "In the internet age, there was an irrational exuberance on a really large scale. In this AI one, there is a lot of tremendous optimism that does indicate a future bubble for certain companies. Is there going to be train wreck? Yes, for those that aren\u2019t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage, how are you going to generate revenue after all the money you poured into it?",
      "Q: Do you think AI is going to eliminate a lot of jobs?",
      "A: It happened with the internet. The problem this time is that if I am right about AI moving at five times the speed of the internet, we are going to destroy jobs faster than we can replace them. Will we be able to replace them over time? Yes, but there is going to be a drought while we have to re-educate lots of people.",

      "A: It\u2019s the most uncertain time on a global basis, ever. I would argue that this is the new normal. With the speed the market is moving at now, you have to be able to reinvent yourself, which most CEOs and business leaders don\u2019t know how to do, especially with AI.",
      "Q: What\u2019s your view of how Big Tech has been working with President Donald Trump during his second term in office?",
      "A: Let\u2019s be realistic. Silicon Valley moved right, there shouldn\u2019t be any doubt. They did it for economic reasons. And practicality, they did it for their shareholders but also regulation was getting out of control. They weren\u2019t able to grow and China was plainly beating us.",
      "Q: How worried are you about China?",
      "A: I think China has full intention to win at the U.S.\u2019s expense. In China, there are no rules, there is no intellectual property, there are no issues about misusing the power. They intend to blow past militarily, economically, and in every other way. I do not view them as a partner, I view them as a serious competitor on all fronts and someone I don\u2019t trust. I think over time people are going to recognize it\u2019s in the U.S.\u2019s best interest and it\u2019s in China\u2019s best interest for us to get along. So go out 10 years, and that\u2019s the most likely outcome. But I think the next five years are going to be really bumpy and dangerous. We should have no illusions that they intend to crush us.",

    "story": [
      "In the wake of Jane Goodall's death, the many scientists and others influenced by her are promising to do their best to carry on her legacy",
      "In her 91 years, Jane Goodall transformed science and humanity's understanding of our closest living relatives on the planet \u2014 chimpanzees and other great apes. Her patient fieldwork and tireless advocacy for conservation inspired generations of future researchers and activists, especially women and young people, around the world.",
      "Her death on Wednesday set off a torrent of tributes for the famed primate researcher, with many people sharing stories of how Goodall and her work inspired their own careers. The tributes also included pledges to honor Goodall\u2019s memory by redoubling efforts to safeguard a planet that sorely needs it.",
      "\u201cJane Goodall is an icon \u2013 because she was the start of so much,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France.",
      "She recalled how many years ago Goodall answered a letter from a young aspiring researcher. \u201cI wrote her a letter asking how to become a primatologist. She sent back a handwritten letter and told me it will be hard, but I should try,\u201d Crockford said. \u201cFor me, she gave me my career.\u201d",
      "Goodall was one of three pioneering young women studying great apes in the 1960s and 1970s who began to revolutionize the way people understood just what was -- and wasn\u2019t -- unique about our own species. Sometimes called the \u201cTri-mates,\u201d Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birut\u00e9 Galdikas spent years documenting the intimate lives of chimpanzees in Tanzania, mountain gorillas in Rwanda, and orangutans in Indonesia, respectively.",
      "The projects they began have produced some of the longest-running studies about animal behavior in the world that are crucial to understanding such long-lived species. \u201cThese animals are like us, slow to mature and reproduce, and living for decades. We are still learning new things about them,\u201d said Tara Stoinski, a primatologist and president of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. \u201cJane and Dian knew each other and learned from each other, and the scientists who continued their work continue to collaborate today.\u201d",
      "Goodall studied chimpanzees \u2014 as a species and as individuals. And she named them: David Greybeard, Flo, Fifi, Goliath. That was highly unconventional at the time, but Goodall\u2019s attention to individuals created space for scientists to observe and record differences in individual behaviors, preferences and even emotions.",
      "Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at St. Andrews University who was inspired by Goodall, recalled how Goodall carefully combined empathy and objectivity. Goodall liked to use a particular phrase, \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as happy,\u201d or \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as friends \u2013- these two individuals together,\u201d Hobaiter said. Goodall didn\u2019t project precise feelings onto the chimpanzees, but nor did she deny the capacity of animals besides humans to have emotional lives.",
      "Goodall and her frequent collaborator, evolutionary biologist Marc Bekoff, had just finished the text of a forthcoming children's book, called \u201cEvery Elephant Has a Name,\u201d which will be published around early 2027.",
      "From the late 1980s until her death, Goodall spent less time in the field and more time on the road talking to students, teachers, diplomats, park rangers, presidents and many others around the world. She inspired countless others through her books. Her mission was to inspire action to protect the natural world.",
      "In 1991, she founded an organization called Roots & Shoots that grew to include chapters of young people in dozens of countries.",
      "Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist and founder of the nonprofit Saving Nature, recalled when he and Goodall were invited to speak to a congressional hearing about deforestation and extinction. Down the marble halls of the government building, \u201cthere was a huge line of teenage girls and their mothers just waiting to get inside the room to hear Jane speak,\u201d Pimm said Thursday. \u201cShe was mobbed everywhere she went -- she was just this incredible inspiration to people in general, particularly to young women.\u201d",
      "Goodall wanted everyone to find their voice, no matter their age or station, said Zanagee Artis, co-founder of the youth climate movement Zero Hour. \u201cI really appreciated how much Jane valued young people being in the room -- she really fostered intergenerational movement building,\u201d said Artis, who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",

      "They harvest in the Alentejo region, sometimes called the \u201cTuscany of Portugal\u201d for its rolling vineyards, olive groves and forests that supply cork for the wines. In this vineyard about a 90-minute drive east of Lisbon, the cool autumn night carries the smell of ripe fruit. The workers' laughter blends with the sound of rustling leaves.",
      "The night harvest is a time-honored practice in viticulture, meant to preserve the freshness of grapes and shield them from the adverse effects of daytime heat, sunlight and oxidation. As summers in Portugal grow longer, hotter and more unpredictable \u2014 in part due to climate change \u2014 the practice has become more common here.",
      "B\u00e1rbara Monteiro, co-owner and manager of the Herdade Da Fonte Santa vineyard said she struggled at first to convince her harvesters to work at night \u2014 midnight to 8 a.m. They began doing so in 2019.",
      "\u201cToday, we can say they actually prefer this schedule, as they can often work almost another day, enjoy the day, and avoid the extreme heat we often experience here,\u201d she said.",
      "The wine harvest in Spain, Italy and Portugal generally takes place between late August and October, with variations based on the region, type of grapes and weather conditions.",
      "Some vineyards have been harvesting at night for years. In parts of Italy, others have for more than a decade. The El Coto de Rioja vineyard in Spain\u2019s famed La Rioja region opts for early morning harvests, beginning at 5 or 6 a.m., according to C\u00e9sar Fern\u00e1ndez, the vineyard's technical director and winemaker.",
      "In Portugal's Alentejo region, daytime temperatures particularly in August can reach 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). At night, they can drop by as much as 20 C (36 F) or more.",
      "Grapes are naturally sensitive to temperature shifts. Warmer weather can make them reach sugar maturity before developing a full flavor and ripeness, leading to higher alcohol levels but less complex wines. Intense heat also speeds up acid loss and can trigger early fermentation as wild yeasts and bacteria become more active.",
      "By harvesting at night, vintners can lock in more vibrant flavors that improve the quality of the wine produced.",
      "\u201cClimate change has greatly influenced our harvest and the process and we\u2019ve adapted over the years,\" Monteiro said.",

      "Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union that represents air traffic controllers, told ABC News that staffing shortages are not necessarily a new problem but that they're drawing more attention now because, \"We're hyper-focused on it.\"",
      "He added, \"It's a shutdown. You're finally seeing the issues of a critically staffed air traffic control system. In the last nine months, there have been 1,058 occurrences where one of our facilities has had to shut down, either temporarily for a few hours or for a shift. It's something that air traffic controllers contend with daily. The shutdown absolutely doesn't help it, but this is something that we deal with day in and day out.\"",

The Philadelphia TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control), Denver Center, Detroit TRACON, Indianapolis Center, Phoenix Airport, and the Phoenix TRACON also had staffing advisories from the Federal Aviation Administration. More than 600 flights Monday were delayed in and out of the Denver Airport and over 200 at Phoenix Airport.",
      "\"There have been increased staffing shortages across the system. When that happens, the FAA slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations,\" the agency said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "NATCA, the air traffic controllers union, said earlier this week it was working with the FAA to mitigate any disruptions in the national airspace.",
      "\"It is normal for a few air traffic controllers to call in sick on any given day, and this is the latest example of how fragile our aviation system is in the midst of a national shortage of these critical safety professionals,\" NATCA said in an earlier statement to ABC News.",

      "Duffy met with controllers handling Newark's airspace Monday and said they expressed concerns over the added financial stress of the shutdown in an already demanding job.",
      "\"The consistent message from these controllers was they're not just now thinking about the airspace and the jobs they have to do in these towers or TRACON centers across the country. They're thinking about, 'Am I going to get a paycheck?'\" Duffy said. \"So now what they think about as they're controlling our airspace is, 'How am I going to pay my mortgage? How do I make my car payment? I have a couple kids at home, how do I put food in the table? I'm working six days a week -- do I have to take a second job and drive Uber when I'm already exhausted from doing a job that's already stressful to think about.'\"",
      "Air traffic controllers will receive a partial paycheck on Oct. 14 but will not be paid on Oct. 28 if the shutdown continues, according to NATCA. Under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (GEFTA), controllers will receive back pay after the shutdown ends.",

      "\"Air carriers that continue to operate EAS flights beyond October 12, 2025, would do so at their own risk as the Department may not be able to pay the contracted subsidy,\" the DOT said in a notice. The notice also says that if carriers continue to operate during the funding lapse, they could be reimbursed on a \"pro rata basis,\" meaning they might not receive the full amount owed.",
      "The biggest impacts would be felt in Alaska, where air travel is the primary mode of transportation. Alaska Sen.

      "Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law Tuesday to go into effect on Jan. 1. It would authorize public schools and community colleges to close on Diwali. State employees could elect to take the day off and public school students will get an excused absence to celebrate the holiday. The new law recognizes that Diwali is also celebrated by Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists.",
      "Pennsylvania was the first U.S. state to make Diwali a statewide holiday in 2024, followed by Connecticut earlier this year.",
      "Assemblymember Ash Kalra, a Democrat from San Jose who coauthored the bill with Darshana Patel, an assemblymember from San Diego, said he grew up celebrating the festival with family members, but it was an experience that was isolated from the rest of his life.",

According to a 2025 Pew survey, 960,000 out of the nation's Indian population of 4.9 million \u2014 or 20% \u2014 live in California. Hindu American organizations, including the Hindu American Foundation and the Coalition of Hindus in North America, advocated for the law.",
      "\u201cThe provisions that allow students to take the day off without repercussion and state employees to take paid leave are important leaps toward making Diwali truly accessible to those who celebrate,\u201d said Samir Kalra, managing director of the Hindu American Foundation.",
      "Diwali, which falls on Oct. 20 this year, is derived from the word \u201cDeepavali,\u201d which means \u201ca row of lights.\u201d Celebrants light rows of lamps to symbolize the victory of light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance. The holiday is celebrated with festive gatherings, fireworks displays, feasts and prayer.",
      "While Diwali is a major religious festival for Hindus, it is also observed by Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists. The origin story of Diwali varies depending on the region. All these stories, across faiths, have the same underlying themes of good triumphing over evil and light over darkness.",

      "Colorado, on the other hand, says the measure simply regulates licensed therapists by barring a practice that's been scientifically discredited and linked to serious harm.",
      "The arguments come months after the Supreme Court's conservative majority found states can ban transition-related health care for transgender youths, a setback for LGBTQ rights. The justices are also expected to hear a case about sports participation by transgender players this term.",
      "Colorado has not sanctioned anyone under the 2019 law, which exempts religious ministries. State attorneys say it still allows any therapist to have wide-ranging, faith-based conversations with young patients about gender and sexuality.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\u201d Colorado state attorneys wrote.",
      "Therapy isn't just speech, they said \u2014 it's health care that governments have a responsibility to regulate. Violating the law carries potential fines of $5,000 and license suspension or even revocation.",
      "Linda Robertson is a Christian mom of four from Washington state whose son Ryan underwent therapy that promised to change his sexual orientation after he came out to her at age 12. The techniques led him to blame himself when it didn\u2019t work, leaving him ashamed and depressed. He died in 2009, after multiple suicide attempts and a drug overdose at age 20.",
      "\u201cWhat happened in conversion therapy, it devastated Ryan\u2019s bond with me and my husband,\" she said. \u201cAnd it absolutely destroyed his confidence he could ever be loved or accepted by God.\u201d",
      "Chiles contends her approach is different from the kind of conversion therapy once associated with practices like shock therapy decades ago. She said she believes \u201cpeople flourish when they live consistently with God\u2019s design, including their biological sex,\" and she argues evidence of harm from her approach is lacking.",
      "Chiles says Colorado is discriminating because it allows counselors to affirm minors coming out as gay or identifying as transgender but bans counseling like hers for young patients who may want to change their behavior or feelings. \u201cWe're not saying this counseling should be mandatory, but if someone wants the counseling they should be able to get it,\u201d said one of her attorneys, Jonathan Scruggs.",

      "Attorney General Pam Bondi will face lawmakers at a congressional hearing amid growing questions about political influence over the Justice Department",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Attorney General Pam Bondi will face lawmakers at a congressional hearing Tuesday amid growing questions about political influence over a Justice Department that has already criminally charged one of President Donald Trump's longtime foes and is facing intense White House pressure to prosecute others.",
      "The testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee comes just ahead of former FBI Director James Comey's first court appearance following an indictment that has deepened concerns that the department is being used to seek vengeance against the president's political opponents. It also comes as federal law enforcement officials surge into several cities across the U.S. to combat crime and enforce immigration laws.",
      "The hearing is likely to split along deeply partisan lines, with Republicans expected to laud the Justice Department's efforts to confront violent crime and reverse Biden-era priorities. Democrats, by contrast, are poised to grill Bondi about a turbulent eight-month tenure that, in addition to politically charged investigations, has also been defined by mass firings and resignations of experienced prosecutors, including some who investigated Trump, resisted Trump administration pressure or simply served in senior roles in the prior administration.",
      "Bondi's appearance is her first before the panel since her confirmation hearing last January, when she pledged to not play politics with the Justice Department \u2014 a promise Democrats are likely to pounce on as they press the attorney general on whether she can withstand pressure from a president publicly calling to charge his perceived enemies.",
      "Bondi and other Republican allies have said the Biden administration, which brought two criminal cases against Trump, was the one that weaponized the department even though some of its most high-profile probes concerned the Democratic president and his son.",
      "The Comey indictment is likely to take center stage at the hearing. The U.S. attorney's office in Virginia that brought the case had expressed reservations about the strength of evidence, and the Trump administration had to race to install a new prosecutor to secure the charges after the experienced leader of that office resigned days earlier under pressure.",

Adam Schiff \u2014 who sits on the Judiciary Committee \u2014 as well as New York Attorney General Letitia James and Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor and current mayoral candidate. They have all denied wrongdoing, as has Comey, and have slammed the investigations as politically motivated.",
      "Bondi is likely to tout the Justice Department's efforts to tackle violent crime by surging federal law enforcement in Washington, D.C., and now Memphis, Tennessee. Republican lawmakers who make up the majority of the committee will also likely highlight the department's focus on illegal immigration and dismantling Mexican cartels responsible for smuggling drugs into American communities.",
      "The attorney general may also face questions about the Justice Department's handling of investigative files related to the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. The wealthy financier's case has dogged the department since its decision in July not to publicly release any more files in its possession after raising the expectations of conservative influencers and conspiracy theorists.",
      "But even in the face of intense conservative outrage, Bondi maintained the strong public support of the president.",

      "The Upper Midwest has some of the largest concentrations of Scandinavian Americans in the U.S., and his tour takes him Tuesday to Minnesota, where well over 800,000 residents claim Norwegian ancestry, according to state demographers. That's more than any other state, though less-populous North Dakota actually has a higher percentage of residents with Norwegian roots. Members of the royal family have made several visits to the region over the years.",
      "Haakon's visit is part of the Crossings 200 commemorations across North America this year.",
      "Nearly 5 million North Americans now claim Norwegian ancestry. The U.S. was a relatively welcoming place for Scandinavians during the main waves of emigration that began in the 1800s. They were drawn to the Upper Midwest by cheap land and jobs.",
      "But much has changed since then, and today immigration is a contentious issue for both the U.S. and Scandinavian and other European countries.",
      "Haakon went Monday to Vesterheim, a museum in Decorah, Iowa, that tells the story of Norwegian immigrants in America. He met there with three descendants of people who arrived on the Restauration, a ship carrying 52 Norwegians that left July 4, 1825, from Stavanger. One of the travelers gave birth on the long voyage, so 53 arrived in New York. More than 800,000 other Norwegians eventually followed.",
      "The crown prince also visited Luther College in Decorah, a school founded by Norwegian immigrants in 1861, which presented him with an honorary degree.",
      "\u201cI will carry it as a symbol of the close friendship between the United States and Norway,\" Haakon told students and faculty. \"Thank you for keeping alive the stories that bind us together across oceans, across generations, across time.\u201d",
      "According to the school, it was the ninth visit to Decorah by members of the royal family since 1939. The most recent previous visit to town was by his parents, King Harald V, who is Europe's oldest monarch, and Queen Sonja, in 2011.",
      "On Tuesday, Haakon was due to visit Norway House, a cultural center in Minneapolis that focuses on bringing contemporary Norway to the U.S. through arts, business and culture.",
      "The crown prince was due to cut a ribbon and tour Norway House's new Saga Center. It's an immersive, interactive exhibit for families to explore their connections with Norway, where they can also navigate 3D outdoor and urban landscapes to learn about the country's friluftsliv (outdoor life) and byliv (city life).",

      "Crews used large nets, water-filled containers and box trucks to relocate hundreds of river otters, sea turtles, manatees, penguins and sharks to their new home: Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium.",
      "Over the past couple of months, the marine animals were removed from the hard-to-reach island and relocated to a brand new center, where Mote believes they will be able to live in more authentic habitats and make it easier for the public to learn about marine sciences. The Mote Science Education Aquarium, just east of Sarasota, is set to open to the public on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe have created new authentic habitats for all our species of marine life, including a massive manatee habitat, and homes for some of our newest animals, like the giant Pacific octopus and our penguins,\" said Kevin Cooper, vice president for communications and strategic Initiatives at Mote.",
      "\u201cWe are also adding more opportunities to learn about marine science for our guests, school children and adult learners and offering new opportunities for citizen scientists to participate in marine science through outreach,\u201d he said.",
      "It was increasingly challenging for visitors to make their way across the bridges from the mainland to the facility on Sarasota's City Island where it had been for 45 years. So it made sense to move the aquarium and education centers farther east while keeping the research portion of the facility on the barrier island.",
      "In July, Mote closed to the public to prepare so the transition could begin. And in August, crews started moving the animals to the new facility.",
      "Mote educated upwards of 350,000 guests each year and it's expected to double that in the new center, Cooper said. It cost $130 million to build.",
      "It took time to make sure the habitats at the new Mote SEA facility had the appropriate water chemistry and microbial communities before the animals arrived.",
      "\u201cIn the process of that relocation, each different species requires a different type of relocation techniques in order to move them from one facility to another,\" said Evan Barniskis, associate vice president for Mote. \u201cWhen moving sharks and fish, you have to do so in water with plenty of oxygen and filtration on it.\u201d",
      "They moved many of the fish and sharks at night, when there was less traffic. The manatees required air-conditioned box trucks that are specifically designed for manatee relocations. Mote has a team devoted to picking up stranded manatees and to rehabilitate them.",
      "\u201cThe otters are a little bit simpler because they have specially designed cages that are kind of similar to those you would put a dog or a cat in,\u201d Barniskis said. He added that they moved them in air-conditioned vehicles.",

(AP) \u2014 The Democratic and Republican ballots aren't short on candidates in Tuesday's Tennessee primary special election to replace a GOP congressman who stepped aside this summer, including one who landed President Donald Trump's endorsement last week.",
      "The race to replace former U.S. Rep. Mark Green centers on one of three districts that GOP lawmakers drew as safely red in 2022 by dividing left-leaning Nashville. The Dec. 2 general election could gauge the popularity of Trump\u2019s aggressive second-term agenda, especially with suburban Republican voters.",
      "The 7th Congressional District spans 14 counties, bordering both Kentucky and Alabama. Its voters elected Green by 21 percentage points in 2024 and by nearly 22 points in 2022. Along with parts of Nashville, it includes rural areas, wealthy suburbs and part of the Fort Campbell military installation.",
      "With 11 Republicans on the ballot, Matt Van Epps turned heads when Trump backed him on Friday, the day after in-person early voting had ended. The endorsement prompted another high-profile candidate, state Rep. Lee Reeves, to announce he was suspending his campaign and backing Van Epps, a former general services commissioner in the administration of GOP Gov. Bill Lee. The governor and Green had already endorsed Van Epps. Trump lauded Van Epps for his military service.",
      "It's too late to remove Reeves' name from the ballot.",
      "The field includes two other Republican state representatives, Gino Bulso and Jody Barrett. Bulso is a Brentwood attorney who has been an outspoken advocate for socially conservative policies, including those that target LGBTQ people's rights. Bulso has poured almost $700,000 of his own wealth into the race.",
      "Outside groups have spent more than $3.1 million, almost all on the GOP side, with upwards of $1.1 million opposing Barrett.",
      "School choice interests who have denounced Barrett's vote against Gov. Lee\u2019s statewide school voucher expansion are behind many of the attack ads against Barrett.

      "A funeral service is set in Salt Lake City for Russell M",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 A funeral service will be held Tuesday in Salt Lake City for Russell M. Nelson, the charismatic sentimentalist who oversaw a significant temple building boom as president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",
      "Nelson led the faith up until his death in late September at the age of 101.",
      "The funeral is expected to draw thousands of mourners to the faith's Conference Center at Temple Square. About 600 members of Nelson's family are expected to attend along with 20,000 people who quickly snapped up tickets that the church offered online within 20 minutes, said church spokesperson Doug Andersen.",
      "The service also will be broadcast globally on the church's website and other online platforms.",
      "Nelson\u2019s funeral will be devoid of formal church rituals, Andersen said. It will resemble a worship service with prayers, hymns and talks and will focus on Nelson's life and purpose, he said.",
      "Both aspects of Nelson\u2019s legacy \u2014 as a spiritual leader for four decades and as a heart surgeon who saved lives \u2014 will be celebrated during the service, Andersen said.",
      "Nelson\u2019s body will be dressed in mostly white temple clothing, the ceremonial garments worn by adult members. The commemoration service, open to Latter-day Saints and non-members, will be conducted by a lay minister. A public viewing was held Monday at the conference center, attended by about 18,560 people, according to Andersen.",
      "He said church funerals typically are \u201cmarked by an atmosphere of hopefulness and peace.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey generally are not burdened by the inconsolable grief and despair so often seen in other funerals,\" he said. \u201cThat is especially true in this case with a life lived beyond 101 years.\u201d",
      "Nelson\u2019s funeral will also feature \u201cheartfelt tributes and comforting music\u201d performed by the famed Tabernacle Choir, said Andersen.",
      "It will include a hymn written by Nelson titled \u201cOur Prayer to Thee,\u201d which was first published in the church\u2019s official publication and performed at general conferences in October 2018 and April 2022. One musician described the song as a special, sacred representation of the relationship between God and the faithful.",
      "Nelson's family members likely will select the other songs and hymns that will be performed at the funeral.",
      "While the funeral will be public, the burial will be private with family. It will take place at Pioneer Cemetery, where Brigham Young and many other pioneers of the faith are buried, Andersen said.",
      "Family plays a significant role in the faith, not just in this life, but also in the afterlife, said Kathleen Flake, former professor of Mormon Studies at the University of Virginia.",

      "The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.",
      "Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.",
      "In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to \u201cenormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.\"",
      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. \u201cThe changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users\u2019 ability to safely download apps,\u201d Google warned.",
      "Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.",
      "In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.",
      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.",

      "President Donald Trump's plan to deploy the military on U.S. soil is sparking conflict with blue state governors that is playing out in the courts",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump's latest bid to deploy the military on U.S. soil over local opposition is triggering a new conflict with blue state governors that is playing out in the courts as Trump envisages a country where armed soldiers patrol U.S. streets.",
      "Trump has already pushed traditional boundaries by using the National Guard domestically, envisioning a muscular role for the U.S. military in targeting illegal immigration and crime in American cities.",
      "His attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon and Texas Guardsmen to Illinois is a sprawling use of presidential power. Next steps in lawsuits filed by Democrat-led states will likely address significant questions of constitutional law, federalism and the separation of powers \u2014 setting up a potential collision between the courts and Trump\u2019s aggressive use of the National Guard.",
      "At a gathering of military brass last week, Trump called for using U.S. cities as a training ground for troops and warned of an \u201cinvasion from within.\u201d To his critics, however, Trump's use of the National Guard amounts to a frightening use of force against Americans.",
      "\u201cWhat will happen when the president loses in court?\u201d said Alex Reinert, a constitutional law expert at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City. \u201cWill he use it as an excuse to act in an even more authoritarian way?\u201d",
      "Rifle-wielding troops on American streets are one of the starkest manifestations of Trump\u2019s attempt to expand presidential power, with troops already deployed to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.",
      "Control over a state's National Guard typically falls to the governor unless units are federalized \u2014 as they were in California over the governor's objections. Otherwise, it's up to the governor to decide to deploy Guard members or send them to other states to assist with natural disasters. In D.C., Trump commands the Guard himself.",
      "Local authorities, Trump says, have failed to safeguard communities, giving several Democrat-led cities as examples. He's called Portland \u201cwar ravaged\" and a \u201cwar zone\u201d that is \u201cburning down\u201d and like \u201cliving in hell.\u201d",
      "However, the nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military\u2019s role in enforcing domestic laws, reflecting America\u2019s long-standing belief that law enforcement should remain in civilian hands.",
      "Trump was asked Monday about another law, the Insurrection Act, and said he would be willing to invoke it if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.",
      "\u201cIf I had to enact it \u2014 I\u2019d do that,\" Trump said. \"If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have to make sure our cities are safe.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that Trump wants to make America's cities safer.",
      "\u2033You guys are framing this like, \u2018The president wants to take over the American cities with the military,\u2019\" Leavitt told reporters Monday. \u201cThe president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials say the decisions to send federalized troops from Texas and California to other states are being made at the highest levels of the Trump administration, bypassing formal Pentagon policy processes that would normally be part of troop deployments.",
      "While this dynamic is not unheard of, one official said, it\u2019s typically used in situations like natural disasters where troops need to move out quickly before formal orders and authorizations. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal situation.",
      "One result is that governors like California's Gavin Newsom and Illinois' JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have become the first to announce troop deployments. Pentagon public affairs officials have struggled to confirm or deny the actions and troop numbers, facing pressure to avoid giving even basic details of military operations and to defer questions to the White House.",

      "A deadly tornado that tore across southeastern North Dakota this summer has been upgraded to an EF5 with winds topping 200 mph (322 kph), the strongest classification of tornado and the first confirmed on American soil in a dozen years, meteorologists said Monday.",
      "The June 20 twister near the town of Enderlin killed three people and at its largest was 1.05 miles wide (1.7 kilometers), carving a path across the prairie for just over 12 miles (19 kilometers). Meteorologists from the National Weather Service office in Grand Forks estimated the tornado's winds reached 210 mph (338 kph), according to the newly released analysis.",
      "The 1999 Bridge Creek-Moore tornado in Oklahoma holds the record of the strongest winds ever recorded in the U.S. at 321 mph (517 kph).",
      "Since the National Weather Service began using Enhanced Fujita scale in 2007, there have been 10 tornadoes categorized as EF5. The 12-year gap between top-of-the-scale ratings is the longest since the agency started keeping records in 1950. The earlier tornadoes were assessed using an older version of the EF scale called the Fujita scale.",
      "\u201cIn the last kind of 12 years, there\u2019s been several strong tornadoes that have come close, but there haven\u2019t been known damage indicators at that time to support the EF5 rating,\u201d said Melinda Beerends, meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service in Grand Forks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes to get tornadoes to hit something,\u201d she said.",
      "The morning after the EF5 tornado, meteorologists from the Grand Forks office headed into the field to assess the damage. They studied how the twister had uprooted trees, tipped over fully loaded rail cars, toppled transmission towers and destroyed farmsteads, including one that had its foundation swept clean with just the basement remaining.",
      "\u201cThe city of Enderlin, other than losing power, pretty much went unscathed,\u201d said Mayor Deon Maasjo. Two men and a woman were killed at two locations east of the town, which is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southwest of Fargo.",

      "Determining a tornado's strength usually takes days or weeks, as meteorologists study the damage to buildings and trees. This case took much longer because of the unusual damage to rail cars, including one that was picked up and hurled far from the rest. The meteorologists worked with engineers and wind damage experts to conduct additional surveys and forensic analysis to determine the EF5 rating, up from the initial estimate of EF3.",
      "The tornado was caused by warm, moist air in a place that's ripe for a thunderstorm, Beerends said. But there was also a high amount of wind shear, which is a variation of wind speed and direction that created the conditions for the tornado.",
      "In recent years, tornadoes have been occurring with greater frequency east of the Mississippi River, said Victor Gensini, professor of atmospheric sciences at Northern Illinois University.",
      "\u201cIf you look 40 to 50 years ago, the tornadoes that were happening in places like Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas are kind of happening there with less frequency, and we\u2019re seeing more tornadoes in places like Birmingham, Little Rock and Memphis,\u201d he said.",
      "Though meteorologists aren\u2019t sure what\u2019s causing the trend, the higher frequency of tornadoes in the Mid-South and Midwest is notable because it\u2019s closer to population centers, Gensini said, so there\u2019s a greater chance a tornado may hit something.",
      "The last recorded EF5 tornado was on May 20, 2013, in a town outside Oklahoma City, killing 24 people and injuring more than 200 others. That tornado tore through hundreds of homes, a school, hospital and bowling alley in Moore, where nearly a decade later, droves of moviegoers lined up to watch the 2024 film \u201cTwisters.\u201d",

      "GENEVA -- GENEVA (AP) \u2014 The head of the U.N. refugee agency suggested Monday that President Donald Trump\u2019s America has carried out deportation practices that violate international law, and criticized a wider \u201cbacklash\u201d in some countries against migrants and refugees.",
      "Filippo Grandi, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, used a speech to lament that drastic funding cuts and shortages have forced his agency, UNHCR, to slash nearly 5,000 jobs this year, or nearly a quarter of its workforce. The cuts may not be finished, he said.",
      "\u201cThis was certainly not an easy year for any of us,\u201d Grandi told the opening of UNHCR\u2019s executive committee. \u201cBut remember, please: There has never been an easy year to be a refugee \u2014 and there never will be.\u201d",
      "He did cite some bright spots and praised the Trump administration-led peace efforts in Congo, where conflict has displaced millions of people.",
      "At the U.N. General Assembly last month, the Trump administration \u2014 which has slashed support this year for international humanitarian aid \u2014 pitched other countries on its view that the global system of seeking asylum has been abused and needs to be revamped, in part by cracking down on migration.",
      "Other traditional donors have cut back their aid outlays for UNHCR this year.",
      "In recent years, the agency has received roughly $5 billion a year \u2014 or half its budgetary requirements \u2014 even as conflict and repression in places like Afghanistan, Myanmar, Sudan, Venezuela and Ukraine have led the number of people fleeing their homes to roughly double over the last decade \u2014 to 122 million.",
      "In the politically charged environment of today, Grandi said, \u201cputting the (U.N.) Refugee Convention and the principle of asylum on the table would be a catastrophic error.\u201d He insisted that \u201cnational sovereignty and the right to seek asylum \u201dare not incompatible.

      "\u201cThanks to peace efforts spearheaded by the United States, instead of speaking only of more bloodshed, or more refugees, we can start to think \u2013 cautiously, but a little bit more optimistically \u2014 of stability and returns,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \"dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \"This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\"",
      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \"The Best of Joy of Painting,\" based on Ross' show, \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics\" and \"This Old House.\"",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",
      "Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received more help than they expected, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" PBS president Paula Kerger said in September. \"I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\"",
      "National Public Radio president and CEO Katherine Maher\u00a0told CBS News in July\u00a0that defunding public media services \"is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.",

      "In a letter, Combs' lawyers urged the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to \"strongly recommend\" that the federal Bureau of Prisons place Combs at FCI Fort Dix, a massive prison located on the grounds of the joint military base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.",
      "FCI Fort Dix, one of several dozen federal prisons with a residential drug treatment program, will best allow Combs \"to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos wrote. He also cited educational and occupational programs available at the prison, located about 70 miles south of New York City.",
      "The request from Combs' attorney came after Subramanian asked his lawyers on Friday at the sentencing hearing to let him know their preference for a prison facility.",
      "Also Monday, President Trump told reporters that Combs had asked him for a pardon. Mr. Trump, referring to Combs by the nickname \"Puff Daddy,\" did not say if he would grant the request. Messages seeking comment on Mr. Trump's remarks were left for Combs' lawyers and his publicity team by The Associated Press.",
      "Combs' sentencing for two prostitution-related charges capped a federal case that featured harrowing testimony about violence, drugs and so-called \"freak-offs,\" and exposed the sordid private life of one of the most influential figures in music.",

      "Deonte' Nash alleged he was frightened throughout his roughly decade-long experience working for the music mogul. The 39-year-old stylist claims Combs choked him multiple times, describing one alleged incident that occurred after he went to a restaurant with R&B singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend whose testimony was critical in his conviction.",
      "The \"I'll Be Missing You\" singer was convicted in July under the federal\u00a0Mann Act, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime. His trial ended in a split verdict, with acquittals on sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have put him behind bars for life.",
      "Combs has been locked up at a federal jail in Brooklyn, the Metropolitan Detention Center, since his September 2024 arrest. His time there will be subtracted from his sentence, meaning he could get out in about three years.",
      "In a letter to Subramanian on the eve of sentencing, Combs said he has gone through a \"spiritual reset\" in jail and is \"committed to the journey of remaining a drug free, non-violent and peaceful person.\"",
      "\"I thank God that I'm stronger, wiser, clean, clear and sober,\" he wrote.",
      "Subramanian has not yet acted on the request to recommend placement at FCI Fort Dix.",
      "Judges often make recommendations about where inmates should serve time, but it's up to the Bureau of Prisons to decide. Those decisions, the agency has said, are based on a variety of factors, including the severity of the offense, the required security level and an inmate's programming needs.",
      "FCI Fort Dix, the largest single federal prison by population with just under 3,900 inmates, is about 64 miles southwest of New York City, where Combs was born and rose to fame as a rapper and entrepreneur in an array of businesses, including fashion, television and liquor. An adjacent minimum-security prison camp has 210 inmates.",
      "Combs once owned a home in New Jersey, selling it nearly a decade ago.",
      "His primary residence, according to court papers, has been a $48 million mansion on an island near Miami. That home and a mansion he owns in Los Angeles were raided by federal agents last year during the investigation that led to his arrest.",
      "FCI Fort Dix has been home to a number of high-profile inmates over the years, including reputed mobsters, drug traffickers, corrupt politicians and Martin Shkreli. For a time, it was run by the warden who had been in charge of a Manhattan federal jail when financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himself at the jail in 2019. That warden, Lamine N'Diaye, has since retired.",
      "In 2021, a 27-year-old Fort Dix inmate was stabbed in the eyeball by a fellow prisoner.",
      "In 2019, a Fort Dix inmate, a former inmate and two other people were arrested for using a drone to smuggle in contraband including cellphones, tobacco, weight-loss supplements and eyeglasses. The same year, a Fort Dix correctional officer pleaded guilty in a separate case to pocketing bribes to smuggle in contraband.",

      "\"You have to admit, I've been misunderstood,\" said singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam. \"Even when I wrote 'Foreigner,' I started with the words, There are no words I can use because the meaning still leaves for you to choose. And so, the artist, to try and explain himself, has got to work a bit harder.\"",
      "In a way, music was a by-product of a lifelong search, says Islam (also known as Cat Stevens), who met with us backstage in London.",
      "I asked, \"Do you get something out of playing on stage that you don't, playing alone?\"",
      "\"I get scared,\" he replied. \"A lot of human beings out there!\"",
      "But this musical giant who got his start in the 1960s, and is now in his late 70s, can still move a crowd.",
      "Nicole Perry Ellis came to London's Hyde Park with her daughter Natasha to attend a Yusuf concert. She described it as a \"very emotional moment. Because before [Natasha] was born, we used to listen to the music when I was pregnant.\"",
      "Natasha described Yusuf as timeless: \"He has spirit, he has soul, and it transcends.\"",
      "\"I think my songs have always been kind of profound in some way,\" Yusuf said. \"A lot of them are so relevant to the world today. I mean, 'Wild World'? You know, come on! And 'Peace Train,' waiting for the train to arrive. Boy, do we need it, yeah. I mean they're relevant.\"",
      "His core themes have endured, as his name has gone through its evolutions. \"I had a girlfriend who looked at me one day and said, 'Ooh, you look like a cat.' And I went, 'What?' That stuck. And then I was looking for a name, because it was going to be difficult to go into the record store and ask for, like, Stephen Demetre Georgiou's latest album.\"",
      "\"Do you think you would have been as successful as Stephen Demetre Georgiou?\" I asked.",
      "\"There's no \u2026 you can't play with fate,\" he replied.",
      "In his new memoir, \"Cat on the Road to Findout,\" he explores family, faith, career, and ego.",
      "He writes that reaching superstardom in his teens was quite difficult. \"The problem with success is that it kind of detaches you from reality in some sense,\" he said. \"Who are you? Are you that person on the screen, on the stage, or is there something more to you? I was looking for some big answers.\"",
      "I asked, \"What all did you try, spiritually?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, the bookshop is full of lots of different views of life and beliefs and philosophies, so I was digging around everywhere. I think the most important thing was when I finally reached the Quran at the end. And that just brought everything together.\"",
      "He took the name Yusuf Islam, and \u2013 believing that music was haram, or forbidden \u2013 redirected his royalties to fund his charity efforts, auctioned off instruments, focused on family, and for nearly 30 years left music.",
      "Why did he believe music was forbidden? \"It took me time to realize that a lot of what I was told in the beginning when I became a Muslim was not exactly right,\" he said. \"You know, Islam doesn't forbid anything that's healthy and morally good.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you reconcile the you who put that aside, with the you who embraced music again?\"",
      "\"You go through stages,\" Yusuf said. \"At one time you can fall in love, and next time you're having such an argument with a person, you say, 'What the hell, get out of my life!' You know, you change, your attitude changes according to circumstance. Context is key.\"",
      "He provides context to a controversial chapter regarding Salman Rushdie's novel \"The Satanic Verses,\" which inflamed the Muslim world \u2013 and the fatwa calling for the author's death. In 1989, in an appearance on a British TV program where hypothetical questions were posed, he was asked if he'd attend an effigy burning of Rushdie, to which he replied, \"I would have hoped that it would have been the real thing, but actually no, if it's just an effigy I don't think I would be that moved to go there.\"",
      "\"I mean, I've got a British sense of humor,\" Yusuf said. \"I took it in a kind of slightly comical direction. It wasn't a good thing to do, because nobody laughed. So, you know, I kind of, I made a mistake in thinking that people might get the joke. But it was a serious issue, so I shouldn't have really done that.\"",
      "\"The joke you mean, saying preferred the real thing, not the effigy?\"",
      "\"Whatever, whatever, whatever.\"",
      "\"When you saw the headlines after that, do you worry even today that \u2013 \"",
      "\"Let's get off this subject, please,\" Yusuf said.",
      "\"You bring it up in the book, so it seems \u2013 \"",
      "\"No, it was only a little part of the book.\"",
      "I said, \"But it seems like with this book you partially wanted to set the record straight from your perspective.\"",
      "\"That's right,\" Yusuf replied. \"I think I've done that.\"",
      "I asked, \"How is it to sit down and write something so personal, to go through the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful?\"",
      "\"I left quite a lot of the ugly out, actually, to be honest!\"",
      "\"You were hard on yourself.\"",
      "\"Really? That's nice to know. I tried to be honest in my writing of songs, and in the writing of my book.\"",
      "This singer-songwriter who once gave up fame for faith has now found his balance, performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens.",
      "Asked how it is to be performing using both names, Yusuf/Cat Stevens replied, \"Actually, it's very symbolic in a way, because for a long time what I wanted to do was to separate myself in a way from my past, and I did that. So, joining these two names together actually forms the complete picture of, like, who I am. And you just have to listen to the songs. They're biographical in themselves. I didn't have to write a book, actually. You just buy the records, you know?\"",

    "story": [
      "He has been called the greatest actor of his generation \u2013 a three-time Oscar-winner, and reluctant star. \"The work itself has always been, has remained nothing but a source of fascination and pleasure to me, the work itself,\" said Daniel Day-Lewis. \"The aftermath of the work has always been difficult for me. You know, you become to some extent a sales rep for that work. And I'm not good at that. I never was. And I'm still not. And that particular part of it, the public part of it, has always left me feeling emptied out.\"",
      "And eight years ago, he announced his retirement. But now, a clarification: \"I think that was a mistake,\" he said. \"I think it just created a kind of confusion. At the time, I never intended to retire from anything. I chose to stop doing one kind of work so that I could perhaps concentrate on a different kind of work.\"",
      "It was part musical interlude: \"My youngest son, Cashel, is a fiddle player. And once the idea took root in my head, like, 'I wonder if I could make him a fiddle,' that was the \u2014 you know, things tend to, yeah, it's hard to let go of a thing.\"",
      "He made three, and he says he has the makings of a fourth, \"but I just haven't got down to it yet.\"",
      "Day-Lewis admits he was surprised to feel a strong impulse to return to acting: \"And largely it was in response to the knowledge that Ronan would be making films.\"",
      "Twenty-seven-year-old middle son Ronan Day-Lewis brings credentials and expectations: His mother, filmmaker and author Rebecca Miller, and grandfather, playwright Arthur Miller.",
      "I asked Ronan, \"Was your move to film a surprise to your parents?\"",
      "\"Not really, because I started making little movies with my friends when I was, like, seven,\" he replied. \"When I was really young, I would always be the one kind of annoyingly trying to corral everyone into making a little movie on our dad's, like, flip camera in the backyard or something.\"",
      "\"Anemone\" is his directorial debut, co-written with his father, who plays Ray Stoker. The story unfolds in a remote cabin. Ronan said, \"The first kind of concrete anchor, I think, was the idea of this man who's kind of in this form of self-exile, that he's living in the middle of nowhere. For some reason that pertains to his past, he's kind of separated himself and banished himself to this isolated place.\"",
      "After twenty years, his brother (played by Sean Bean) arrives to bring Ray Stoker back to the son he's never met. Daniel said, \"I felt I knew Ray fairly early on in the writing process. I don't know why I did. I just did. I can't explain it.\"",

      "Daniel Day-Lewis is legendary for his immersive preparation \u2013 as a fashion designer (\"Phantom Thread\"), in the boxing ring (\"The Boxer\"), in a wheelchair (\"My Left Foot\"). But after more than 20 film roles, one character remains elusive: Daniel Day-Lewis.",
      "I asked what drives him to such perfection.",
      "\"I've resisted analysis to a large extent because, maybe out of superstition, I thought it might interfere with the impulse, which was strong in me and still is,\" Daniel replied. \"But I mean, put on the spot I'd say it's got something to do with that period of time which was very bleak in my life when I was sent away to school.\"",
      "His mother, actress Jill Balcon, came from a prominent British film family. His father, Cecil Day-Lewis, who died when Daniel was 15, was well-known in literary circles \u2013 perhaps not so well-known at home.",
      "\"It's not that we never got to see him,\" said Daniel. \"He was a good man. But my only conversations that I remember having with him [was] when I was in trouble, which I was frequently for all kinds of different things. That's my memory of it. It may be a distorted memory.\"",
      "In 1968, his father was named poet laureate of the United Kingdom, and Daniel was sent to boarding school at 11. \"I felt like I was at sea,\" he said. \"I had no friends. I was being bullied. I was scrappy, but in that place you're considered to be, like, just outrageously uncivilized if you took a swipe at someone, which I did now and then.\"",
      "Despite pleading, he was left to tough it out: \"It was my father's decision. He believed I should stay there, and that I would feel a sense of defeat if I left. But I don't think, because he didn't really see me, he didn't understand the degree to which I was already defeated.\"",
      "And yet, boarding school is where he found his life's work. \"I did a few little bits and pieces in school plays,\" he said. \"And it wasn't the magic of the theater for me; it was the alternative world, where everything around me seemed fairly dark. That was a place that was illuminated for me.\"",
      "But stardom came with a darker side, as he was forewarned by the head of a prestigious summer theater program for teens 50 years ago. \"He launched into a kind of cautionary tale about the world of professional acting and the theater, about the sleaze and the corruption, and I was really quite na\u00efve at that time. But something about what he said that day stayed with me. I never wondered about the work, but I began to wonder about the world that I was going into. And so, I did reach a crossroads where I wondered whether perhaps I'd become a cabinet maker, a furniture maker, instead.\"",
      "He seems to have found a comfortable place at the crossroad in \"Anemone\":\u00a0 a reluctant father on film, and devoted father off-camera.",
      "\"Anemone\" is the culmination of a yearslong father-son collaboration.",
      "I asked Ronan about the trust and confidence implied in that collaboration. \"Yeah, yeah, he never implied that that was a big deal,\" he replied. \"But I always felt that incredible sense of pressure, not wanting to let him down. I felt that actually probably more deeply than the kind of external pressure of how the film might be received, or the expectations that come with his, you know, comeback.\"",
      "An unexpected return eagerly awaited. Yet, Daniel Day-Lewis is muted in his expectations: \"We don't last long. Film sometimes can have a long life, and I suppose you can't help hoping that something of your work will be significant to a person in times to come. But there's, yeah, no guarantee of that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Miley Cyrus has been in the public eye for most of her life, and while you might know her music, don't think you really know her.",
      "Asked what it's like to go through life and have strangers think they know her, Cyrus replied, \"I love my life, so I don't ever really have \u2013 I haven't made too much of a list of the things that are negative about it, 'cause there's so many great things. But I would say one of the things that I don't love and don't appreciate so much is when you meet somebody and they go, 'Wow, you're like, so cool. You're so smart. You're nothing like I thought you would be.' So yeah, that's a tough one.\"",
      "Her ninth album might not be what you'd expect, either. In \"Something Beautiful,\" Cyrus stretches herself artistically. As one critic put it, the album takes her from pop princess to legacy artist. That's quite a leap, even for someone with music in their blood.",
      "Miley's mom, Tish Cyrus Purcell, is a producer. Dad is country star Billy Ray Cyrus. Her godmother? Dolly Parton.",
      "Miley Cyrus lived with showbiz royalty, and that raspy voice, all her life: \"I've sounded like this since I was little. My dad used to have all the country singers come over to the house, and George Jones would, you know, joke that I had smoked cigarettes or been up all night, you know, even when I was four years old.\"",
      "At age 13, she was suddenly famous after being cast as \"Hannah Montana,\" in the Disney Channel series about a girl who was a typical teen by day and a pop star by night. It's a role she's still proud of: \"I love her. She's everything. I would have nothing, none of this \u2013 I mean, maybe I could've figured it out, maybe I could've gotten myself from Nashville, Tennessee, to Los Angeles. I don't know. But she did it a lot faster, and better, and set me up for the life that I have now. So love her, gratitude, all of that.\"",
      "The years after \"Hannah Montana\" were a bit less wholesome. Her 2013 MTV Music Video Awards performance was met with shock and outrage, especially among moms of young kids who had grown up watching her as a Disney star.",
      "I asked, \"There were moms that were trying to, I guess, cancel you?\"",
      "\"Yeah. I was the first person to maybe ever be canceled, I guess.\"",
      "\"How would you describe that time in your life?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, I didn't know until I was older actually how brutal it really was,\" Cyrus said. \"It was very, I guess, you know, challenging for other people. But for me it was a good time. It looked fun, and it was fun.\"",
      "Eventually it was all a little too much fun. Cyrus says she's been sober for a few years now.",
      "\"How has sobriety affected you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, I like showing up 100%, 100% of the time,\" Cyrus replied. \"The hardest part about balancing, you know, any sort of substance use or drinking when you want to do what I do is you're going, 'Okay, well, now I have to get sober for this thing, 'cause I wanna show up my best.' And now, I get to trim out so much of the preparation of getting yourself into the right place mentally and physically. I'm just always ready.\"",
      "Something she was ready for: \"Flowers,\" the biggest pop single of 2023, and her biggest record to date.",
      "She was also ready for this: Her first two Grammys, for best pop solo performance and record of the year, for \"Flowers.\" Accepting the Grammy she said, \"This award is amazing, but I hope it doesn't change anything, because my life was beautiful yesterday.\"",
      "For Miley Cyrus, today is looking good as well.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" joined her this summer at L.A.'s Million Dollar Theatre, where she was shooting a music video for the deluxe version of \"Something Beautiful.\" The song is \"Secrets,\" and if you think it sounds a bit like Fleetwood Mac, you're right: you can hear drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Lindsey Buckingham on the track.",
      "Miley sings about a white flag of surrender, and her outfit is basically a white flag in itself. She told us the song is meant as a peace offering to her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus. They'd been estranged since her parents' divorce in 2022.",
      "Asked how he reacted when she gave him the song, Miley replied, \"My dad cried. You know, you don't see your dad cry a lot. But with me and my dad, we just have always communicated better through music with each other.\"",
      "\"And you're at peace now with each other?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "And at 32, it seems Miley Cyrus is at peace with herself.",
      "\"I think the authentic joy of doing what I want to do has always eclipsed the negatives for me,\" she said. \"I feel really good. And I really like who I am, and I like what I'm doing with my life. And I think if I was outside of myself, I would want to be a part of what I'm doing in any way that I could be.

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Through her groundbreaking observations while living among chimpanzees in the jungles of Tanzania, anthropologist and conservationist Jane Goodall (April 3, 1934-Oct. 1, 2025) transformed the study of the animal world after witnessing chimps fashioning and using tools, which at the time was believed to be unique to humans. Her field research also documented the distinct personalities of the chimps she studied. Through her books, articles, documentary films and public appearances over six decades, Goodall changed how the world perceived homo sapien's closest relative in all their emotional and social complexity.",
      "Her fascination with animals began in childhood, spending hours in a tree reading \"Tarzan.\" \"There was no TV back then,\" Goodall told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2021. \"That's when my dream began. I'll go to Africa, live with animals, write books about them. That was it. No intention of being a scientist, because girls didn't do that sort of thing.\"",
      "Working in Nairobi as an assistant to Louis Leakey, the paleoanthropologist raised money for Goodall to spend six months studying chimpanzees in the Gombe rain forest in Tanzania bringing her \"fresh pair of eyes and fiery spirit,\" she said. \"I clearly was passionate. I clearly had an understanding of animals. And he felt that women might be better in the field, that we might be more patient. Also, he wanted somebody who hadn't been to college, so he wanted an unbiased mind.\"",
      "Living among the chimpanzees, she eventually gained the animals' trust. She witnessed chimps fashioning and using tools \u2014 using twigs to fish for termites. She also detected chimps having distinct personalities and share \"human\" emotions, like pleasure, sadness and fear. She documented the bond between mother and child, and sibling rivalry. \"A lot of people refused to believe it,\" Goodall said. \"Why should they believe this young girl? She hadn't even been to college!\"",
      "But National Geographic sent cameraman Hugo van Lawick, and his film corroborated her findings. He also photographed Goodall \u2014 and became her husband.",
      "She later founded the Jane Goodall Institute, and devoted decades of her life to education about and advocacy for protecting the environment. She gave lectures and toured; she was typically on the road 300 days a year, and was in California on a speaking tour when she died.",
      "Four years ago, Goodall was asked by \"Sunday Morning\" why she persisted in such a grueling schedule. \"Because there's a message to get out, and I'm getting older, and there's less time left ahead of me, and the world's falling to pieces,\" she replied. \"Everybody can do something. I mean, when you go shopping you can ask yourself, 'Hmm, did this product harm the environment when it was made? Was it cruel to animals? Is it cheap?\u00a0Why\u00a0is it cheap? Is it cheap because of unfair wages? \u2026 If they care about the future, especially if they've got children, you don't have to do it all. You know, even if you just pick one thing, like eating less meat. Just do\u00a0something.\""

    "story": [
      "After eight seasons traveling the world for his Netflix series \"Somebody Feed Phil,\" Phil Rosenthal's next food adventure is keeping him much closer to home. The 65-year-old producer is opening a neighborhood spot in Los Angeles called Max and Helen's.",
      "\"This is a hundred-year-old neighborhood,\" Rosenthal said. \"I want it to look like we found a hundred-year-old diner and it's been here for a hundred years.\"",
      "The diner, set to open later this month in Larchmont, is named for Rosenthal's late parents, who were regulars on his travel show and inspired characters in \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" the CBS sitcom he created nearly 30 years ago.",
      "The menu will lean on comfort food: Powdered donut holes, sourdough waffles with maple butter and fluffy scrambled eggs, a nod to his father's favorite dish.",
      "\"My dad loved fluffy eggs so much on his tombstone, it says, 'Are my eggs fluffy?'\" Rosenthal said. \"The lesson for me is, if you can find a simple joy in your life, maybe you'll be happy every day.\"",
      "Rosenthal grew reflective when speaking about his father's absence.",
      "\"I'm getting a little emotional that he can't be here for this perfect rendition of the thing he loved the most,\" he said.",
      "Building the world of \"Everybody Loves Raymond\"",
      "Simplicity, Rosenthal said, has always been key to his work. \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" ran for nine years by avoiding topical humor.",
      "\"You don't put in Bill Clinton jokes in the '90s,\" he said. \"You do the things that seem to be everlasting.\"",
      "After struggling to find a follow-up to the sitcom, Rosenthal pitched his Netflix show with one line: \"I'm exactly like Anthony Bourdain if he was afraid of everything.\" The food-and-travel series grew into a surprise hit, even drawing sold-out crowds when Rosenthal spoke about it on tour. \"Ray [Romano] came out on stage with me and couldn't believe the size of the crowd,\" he said.",
      "Rosenthal has enlisted acclaimed chef Nancy Silverton as executive chef, while his soon-to-be son-in-law Mason Royal will run the kitchen. Beyond the food, he hopes the diner will anchor his neighborhood.",
      "\"Diners are disappearing from America,\" he said. \"These become centers of communities\u2026. If the center of the community disappears, maybe you lose the sense of community and then maybe you lose the country. So I'm gonna fix everything with my diner.\"",
      "His production company is called Lucky Bastards, a label that still fits as he finds new joy in simple pleasures and fresh projects at 65.",
      "But Rosenthal brushed off any suggestion of retirement.",
      "\"I could. That's not fun,\" he said. \"If you think you've got something to say or a point to make, or feel like your work is impacting on one guy or one little kid even, who wants to stop?\"",
      "Tony Dokoupil is a co-host of \"CBS Mornings\" and \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" Dokoupil also anchors \"The Uplift,\" a weekly series spotlighting positive and inspiring stories for CBS News 24/7."

    "summary": "Nobel Prize committee chair says discoveries by the trio of researchers were \"decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions.\"",
    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",
      "The award is the first of the 2025 Nobel Prize announcements and was announced by a panel at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.",

    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "The dispute at the heart of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown\u00a0centers around a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit. A new Oct. 3 survey from health information group KFF found that three-quarters of those polled say they want Congress to extend the tax credits, with about 59% of Republicans saying they would like to see an extension.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

      "Pfizer is the first of many drug makers the president claimed has agreed to offer steep drug discounts to all Americans through TrumpRx, in line with the lowest prices paid by Europeans.",
      "\"We've seen this disparity for a long time, and we know it has not been sustainable,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary told CBS News in an interview Thursday.",
      "The president also said that Pfizer had agreed to lower the cost of the prescription medications that it provides to Medicaid recipients.",
      "\"Pfizer is committing to offer all of their prescription medications to Medicaid, and it will be at the most-favored nations prices,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Makary argues the Trump administration's agreement with Pfizer will help in addressing health care costs across the board.",
      "\"By reigning in egregious drug prices, we're actually addressing the larger issue of healthcare costs in the United States, which is something no one has really be able to get a handle on until now,\" Makary said.",
      "According to Pfizer, TrumpRx will provide savings up to 85% for certain medications, such as Duavee, a drug that treats menopause symptoms.",
      "Duavee's sticker price is $203 per month, but according to Pfizer, on TrumpRx, it will cost $30 per month. Xeljanz, a Pfizer medication for arthritis, currently costs $6,000 out-of-pocket per month, but on TrumpRx, it will cost about $3,600.",
      "\"This is a major, major step, and we have to do it,\" Makary told CBS News when asked if, even with the discounts, the drugs will still be unaffordable for many Americans.",
      "The Trump administration said the TrumpRx website will launch next year, but Makarty did not have specific timing.",
      "Makary believes that patients with health insurance who are still unable to afford certain medications will still be helped by TrumpRx.",
      "\"I think it's going to help them significantly,\" Makary said. \"You're going to see a series of announcements by different pharmaceutical companies. This has been the No. 1 health priority in this administration.\"",
      "Sarah Wisniewski, a Maryland resident in her mid-40s, has been living with multiple sclerosis since 2018. Although she she says she has good insurance, it has repeatedly failed to cover the specialty medication her doctor prescribed to slow the progression of her disease. In 2024, when her physician recommended a treatment that could help, she says her insurance company denied coverage three times. She was only approved after the Maryland attorney general intervened.",
      "When CBS News asked Makarty about Wisniewski, he explained, \"I've seen that story throughout my career as a cancer surgeon, and it's tragic, and we've seen nothing on drug prices for the last 50 years.\"",
      "More than 90% of Americans have some form of health insurance, yet many still struggle to afford critical medications. Wisniewski told CBS News she is skeptical about the new TrumpRx program.",
      "\"If big pharma isn't required to put their drugs on this market, and if they're not forced to lower prices, then this feels like a toothless, symbolic statement, as opposed to having any real, long-term impact on the lives of the clinically ill,\" she said.",
      "She also questioned how the administration plans to pressure pharmaceutical companies to list the most urgently needed medications on the platform. Even at 50% to 80% cheaper, she said, some of these drugs remain unaffordable.",
      "Makary told CBS News that this is just the beginning of the solution:",
      "\"Each year, we throw good money after bad into a broken system where we pay more and more for drugs,\" Makary said. \"This is the first time we're seeing a major reset \u2014 cutting the price of some drugs, not all, but some, by 50% to 80%.\"",
      "Stacie Dusetzina, a prescription medication industry expert and a health policy professor at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, says the president's plan will not lower most Americans' out-of-pocket costs for medications.  \"The reality of who can actually benefit by paying cash for these drugs through this website, it's probably going to be a smaller number of people than what is being promoted,\" Dusetzina said.",

    "story": [
      "Wealth has long been tied to longevity in the U.S. and other countries, but a new analysis helps quantify the gap between how long low-income older Americans and their more affluent peers tend to live.",
      "Low-income people over 60 years old die an average of nine years earlier than high-income older Americans, according to the new study from the National Council on Aging\ufeff\u00a0(NCOA) and University of Massachusetts Boston's LeadingAge LTSS Center, which studies aging.",
      "Generally, middle-income older Americans are also dying younger than wealthier people, the researchers founds. About 15% of seniors with annual household incomes of roughly $60,000 died during the four-year study period, compared with about 11% in households with incomes of around $120,000.",
      "\"This is the first time we've tied health and wealth together \u2014 this was really shocking for me,\" said Jessica Johnston, senior director of the NCOA's Center for Economic Well-Being, of the nine-year life gap. \"We all traditionally and culturally were taught to value our elders, and if we played by the rules we could age well, and I think that's changing.\"",
      "The study is based on an analysis of data from 2018 to 2022 gathered through the University of Michigan's Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal panel study that tracks 10,000 households. NCOA, a nonprofit group based in Arlington, Virginia, advocates for older adults.",
      "The findings have implications for an aging society that has seen widening economic inequality, with the income gap between the richest and poorest households growing wider in recent decades, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., as well as\u00a0to other researchers.",
      "As the U.S. population ages, the divide between rich and poor is also reflected in the experiences of senior citizens, with many reaching retirement age without the financial resources to handle shocks like a health emergency or the loss of a spouse, the NCOA study found.",
      "The difference in average mortality age by income could be due to a lack of preventative care for low-income seniors, an inability to pay for care as they age or the stress of financial instability, Johnston said.",
      "The poverty rate among U.S. seniors rose to 15% last year from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to Census data.",
      "\"Older adults are placed into situations where they are going to have to make really difficult decisions: Am I going to go to the grocery store, am I going to pay rent or am I going to get my medication?\" Johnston told CBS News. \"It's not only about forgoing one of those things, but it's the added stress about those decisions.\"",
      "About 80% of people over 60 have few, or even zero, financial assets and would struggle to cope with a financial shock like the loss of a spouse or needing long-term care, according to the report. Most of those Americans will face financial insecurity in their later years, the researchers said.",
      "\"If older adults can't afford long-term care or can't afford medicine, family members are often picking up that cost,\" Johnston said. \"The lost economic productivity among Gen Xers and millennials will play out over the next one to two decades.\"",

    "story": [
      "Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \"dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \"This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\"",
      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \"The Best of Joy of Painting,\" based on Ross' show, \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics\" and \"This Old House.\"",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",
      "Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received more help than they expected, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" PBS president Paula Kerger said in September. \"I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\"",
      "National Public Radio president and CEO Katherine Maher\u00a0told CBS News in July\u00a0that defunding public media services \"is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.",

      "The union representing the nation's air traffic controllers is directing its members to keep working during the U.S. government shutdown now stretching\u00a0into its second week, with the labor group warning that failure to report for duty could lead to termination.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) told members Monday that it discourages federal employees from taking any actions that would compromise air safety. The group represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers, engineers and professionals in aviation safety-related roles.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals take their responsibility to protect the safety of the flying public very seriously. Participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,\" NATCA said in a message to members posted in part on the group's\u00a0website. \"It is not only illegal, but it also undermines NATCA's credibility and severely weakens our ability to effectively advocate for you and your families.\"",
      "Sick calls edge up",
      "The union's warning came as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey that TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick since the shutdown began last week.",
      "\"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes,\" he told reporters. \"You'll see delays come from that. ... Our priorities are safety, and so if we have additional calls, we will reduce the flow consistent with a rate that's safe for the American people.\"",
      "Duffy also acknowledged the potential effect on worker morale of being required to work without pay.",
      "\"They have bills,\" he said. \"So now they're thinking about that at the same time that they're controlling the airspace, which I don't like that. \u2026 We want them to leave their personal problems at the door when they go into a tower or into a facility.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Duffy told\u00a0CNBC that controllers are anxious both because the job itself is demanding and because \"they're concerned they may not get a paycheck.\"",
      "The \"shutdown is forcing them to work without the guarantee that their paychecks come in a timely manner. So they're stressed,\" he added.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration defines air traffic controllers as\u00a0essential workers, requiring them to stay on the job during government closures despite going unpaid. Essential employees required to continue working during a shutdown are guaranteed back pay once the stalemate ends and lawmakers restore government funding.",
      "\"We cannot stress enough that it is essential to avoid any actions that could reflect poorly on you, our Union, or our professions,\" NATCA said in the message to workers.\u00a0\"We urge you to stand in solidarity with your brothers and sisters by continuing to exhibit the same unwavering professionalism that the aviation community and the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"Uncertainty and hardships\"",
      "In a video message on TikTok, NATCA President Nick Daniels also noted that the government shutdown \"creates uncertainty and hardships for our members.\"",
      "NATCA didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "TSA officers are also deemed essential essential workers under federal rules and must continue reporting to work during the lapse in federal funding. During previous shutdowns, being forced to work without pay has led to a rise in worker absences\u00a0and some leaving government service, according to former TSA officials.",
      "During the 34-day government shutdown from December of 2018 to January of 2019, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick, according to the agency, leading to delays in security screenings at major airports across the U.S.",
      "More recently, a\u00a0nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers has led to delays at airports across the U.S. According to a CBS News review, more than 90% of air traffic control towers across the country are understaffed (Visit\u00a0fly.faa.gov\u00a0for real-time information on any flight impacts at U.S. airports because of staffing, weather or other factors.)",

      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",

      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",

Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",

      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",

      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

      "\"The Official Release Party of a Showgirl\" played at hundreds of theaters nationwide over the weekend to enthusiastic fans decked out in friendship bracelets and other Swift-themed attire. The movie featured the world premiere of Swift's music video, \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" one of the 12 tracks on her new studio album, along with behind-the-scenes footage.",
      "The album, released Friday, sold a total of 2.7 million physical and digital copies in its first day in the U.S, according to industry research firm Luminate. That broke Swift's record for most sales in the first week, according to the Associated Press.

      "\"For Taylor Swift to harness the power of the movie theater to build her brand, create excitement among her fans, and create a communal experience outside of her touring, outside of her live performances, is really a stroke of genius,\" Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, told the Associated Press. \"To be able to add another $33 million to the box office bottom line is much welcomed by theater owners who were looking for content for their big screens.\"",

      "The release marks Swift's second partnership with AMC. After the Eras Tour, which netted a record-breaking $2.2 billion, she released an accompanying concert film, becoming the biggest of its kind to date. That movie earned\u00a0between $95 million and $97 million in North America during its opening weekend.",
      "Other companies have also sought to cash in on the hype surrounding the 35-year-old pop star's new album, with Krispy Kreme offering doughnuts in its signature colors and KitchenAid releasing a limited-edition orange mixer inspired by the record. On Oct. 3, Magnum Ice Cream gave out glitter-coated bars at a pop-up on New York City's Cornelia Street, where Swift once lived.",

      "Such employees are by law entitled to back pay once a funding agreement is reached, but independent contractors who sell goods or services to the U.S. government are not similarly protected.",
      "Dan Koh, the former chief of staff at the Labor Department under President Biden, recently said on his podcast that workers employed by companies that have contracts with the government are hurt in a shutdown.",
      "That's because there's no guarantee such workers will be paid once the government reopens, according to Koh. But even federal workers who eventually receive back pay can suffer during a shutdown, as many of them live paycheck to paycheck, he added.",
      "\"Even if you are entitled to back pay, a lot of people can't go even a couple of days without their regularly scheduled paycheck,\" he told CBS News. \"If you have to pay your subway fare, for gas, if something breaks in your home, and you're not getting paid, it places extreme stress on government employees,\" he said.",
      "Members of Congress and the President continue to receive paychecks during a shutdown.",
      "Who gets paid and who does not?",
      "Federal workers, including both furloughed and excepted government employees, receive back pay under a federal law guaranteeing that they'll eventually be made whole.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019\u00a0states that workers who are furloughed due to a lapse in federal funding, as well as excepted workers who are considered essential and required to work without being paid, all receive back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "By contrast, workers and businesses that contract with the government are not similarly guaranteed delayed compensation.",
      "Roughly 620,000 people, or about 28% of federal workers, are projected to be furloughed during the shutdown, according to an Oxford Economics analysis of government data. Additionally, millions of private sector workers who are supported by federal grants and contracts could see their pay be affected by the shutdown, according to the economic advisory firm.",
      "The group estimates that the government supports up to an additional 10 million private workers through federal grants and contracts.",
      "In 2024, the federal government spent about $755 billion on contracts for a wide variety of goods and services, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.",
      "\"The government is the largest buyer of goods and services, so when they are not paying, it's not ripples, it's waves,\" Aron Beezley, co-leader of the Government Contracts Practice Group at Bradley, a national law firm, told CBS News.",
      "Personnel needed to process payment",
      "Some federal contracts are fully funded, meaning the government has already allocated money to a given job, and it's likely to continue.",
      "\"If your contract is fully funded by the previous year's appropriations, your contract will go forward, generally speaking,\" he told CBS News.",
      "But even then, companies can expect snags in getting paid on schedule during a shutdown. That's because government personnel tasked with processing contractor invoices might not be at work.",
      "\"When you submit invoices during a shutdown, the system the government uses to pay contractors requires human involvement. Invoices need to be reviewed, and a lot of times a contractor has questions for the folks who process invoices,\" Beezley explained.",
      "As a result, contractors with fully funded contracts can encounter practical impediments to receiving payments they are owed.",
      "\"If nobody is home to process the invoice, it can be challenging to get paid, which can create cash flow issues, particularly for small businesses,\" Beezley said.",
      "Partially funded contracts",
      "A company with an incrementally funded government contract may find itself in a more precarious financial position. Under such contracts, the government pays a business for the work it does as a job progresses.",
      "\"During a shutdown, the funds might not be there for a contractor, and in such situations, those contractors are looking at whether they need to stop working or keep going, and try to get the government to pay them later,\" Beezley said.",
      "Even when contractors want to continue doing their jobs, they might be impeded by practical obstacles.",
      "\"Say a person who unlocks a government facility in the morning has been furloughed and a contractor shows up Monday morning and can't get into the facility \u2014 that impacts their performance,\" Beezley said.",
      "Federal agencies have the discretion to terminate such contracts, at which point a company can decide whether or not to continue paying workers, or assign them to another job.",
      "\"Most contracting companies out of goodness of heart don't keep paying janitors,\" Koh said. \"So in effect, most of them aren't getting paid.\"",
      "Attempts at legislation",
      "In 2023, Sen. Tina Smith, a Democratic Senator for Minnesota, introduced legislation to secure back pay for federal contract workers facing layoffs during a potential shutdown.",
      "\"Contractor employees perform jobs that are critical to the operation of our government, providing food service, security, and doing custodial work,\" Smith said in a statement at the time. \"These are often low-wage jobs that mean workers are living paycheck to paycheck. In the past, these workers haven't received back pay at the end of a government shutdown like the thousands of government employees. And it's time we right that wrong.\"",
      "The bill failed to advance.",
      "Small businesses",
      "As far as ripple effects go, businesses in places like Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland, that depend on government workers' patronage could start feeling a pinch if the shutdown drags on for more than a few weeks. Without cash in their pockets, such workers are expected to pull back on their discretionary spending, according to economists.",
      "\"If a shutdown is prolonged, there will be repercussions for businesses in certain areas with a large number of federal workers, if they aren't being paid,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics told CBS News. \"Areas that rely on the government workforce to spend at their business could be vulnerable.\"",

      "The app, which is free, relies on crowdsourcing to track ICE agents, with the company noting that it allows people to report sightings of ICE activities \"within a 5 mile radius of your current location.\" The app crossed 1 million downloads a month ago, the developer said. In its social media post, the ICEBlock developer blamed \"pressure from the Trump Admin.\" for the decision.",
      "\"We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps,\" Apple said in a statement. \"Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store.\"",
      "In a comment to CBS News, Attorney General Pamela Bondi said the Department of Justice had asked Apple to remove the app.",
      "\"We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store \u2014 and Apple did so,\" Bondi said. \"ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed. This Department of Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe.\"",
      "ICEBlock is one of a number of apps designed to let users track and anonymously report immigration agents. Another such tool, called Coqui, was still available on the App Store as of Friday morning. Some migrants are relying on the apps to alert them to the location of ICE agents to avoid arrest amid the Trump administration's ramp up of deportation activities.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, told CBS News that apps that track ICE agents \"put the lives of the men and women of law enforcement in danger as they go after terrorists, vicious gangs and violent criminal rings.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Oct 2025 14:27:13 -0400",
    "summary": "The number of unemployed people looking for work more than six months has surged to its highest level since 2021.",
    "story": [
      "When Anna Whitlock was let go from her job in the technology industry in November of 2024, she wasn't worried about lining up a new position. The Washington state resident had 11 years of experience managing network infrastructure projects, a specialized role that involves equipping buildings with internet access, cameras and wifi security systems.",
      "\"The last time I had to job search, I found something pretty easily,\" she said.",
      "Almost a year later, the 37-year-old is still without a job. Whitlock said she has applied to hundreds of jobs \u2014 even for positions she's overqualified for \u2014 to no avail.",
      "\"The more I looked, the more I wasn't getting responses. If I did have an interview, I only made it the first one or two rounds,\" said Whitlock, who has a 16-year-old daughter. \"Things got really real when my unemployment ran out.\"",
      "Sidelined for months",
      "While the government's September jobs report\u00a0wasn't released on Friday\u00a0because of the government shutdown, other recent economic signals point to an increasingly challenging job market for people like Whitlock. Private employers\u00a0declined by 32,000 jobs\u00a0in September, according to payroll processing firm ADP. The number of job openings around the U.S. has also steadily dropped, economic data shows.",
      "And while the nation's unemployment rate remains historically low, at 4.3%, the share of Americans defined as long-term unemployed \u2014 or those unemployed for 27 weeks or longer \u2014 has risen to 26%, the highest in more than three years, labor data shows.",
      "As of August, the number of long-term unemployed people had risen to 1.9 million, according to government data \u2014 the highest level since 2021, when the nation was still reeling from the pandemic.",
      "With the job market faltering in recent months as employers put the brakes on hiring, more workers are being sidelined for months on end, economists told CBS News.",
      "\"We're continuing to see this low-hire, low-fire environment,\" said Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. \"There aren't really new jobs being opened up for people \u2014 there isn't room for new people to come in.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Thursday captures the dimming view many Americans have of the labor market, with 33% of respondents describing it as \"good,\" down from 41% in April. What's more, 48% said they think there are fewer good jobs where they live compared to five years ago.",
      "1,000 job applications",
      "The rise in long-term unemployed Americans poses two risks, Ullrich said. Workers themselves can suffer financial setbacks as they burn through savings and take on debt to stay afloat. And the broader U.S. economy can suffer if people give up on looking for work after becoming discouraged at the prospects of finding a job.",
      "\"Folks who do go into this long-term unemployment category, it's harder for them to get back into the labor force,\" he said. \"The concern is that they become discouraged workers and they stop working, and then they fall out of the labor force entirely.\"",
      "People who have been hunting for a job for months say the process is both frustrating and demoralizing, especially after sending hundreds of applications that fail to get a response. James Strawn, 55, a software quality expert in Colorado who lost his job in July, said he's submitted 100 applications and only received one response.",
      "\"I've had people say, 'Those are rookie numbers, like that is nothing \u2014 I've submitted 1,000 applications',\" he told CBS News. \"Every morning when I get on LinkedIn \u2014 I'm on there all day now \u2014 I see another post that's like another horror story of looking for jobs.\"",
      "Strawn said he was rejected from a minimum wage job at a fitness center, and has taken on a seasonal job at UPS. But he's increasingly fearful that he may not find work in his technology field by year-end, when his severance pay runs out.",
      "Strawn also worries that ageism could be playing a role in his struggle to land a job in his field. \"It's going to take a small miracle to find something,\" he said. \"It's really tough \u2014 it's really a bad market.\"",
      "It's not only experienced workers who are struggling. Young workers and recent college graduates are also having a hard time breaking into the job market. Because there's a glut of workers looking for jobs, employers are requiring that applicants have more extensive \u00a0resumes, Ullrich told CBS News.",
      "\"They are asking for more years of experience, like nine-plus,\" she said. \"Most of it is because they can.\"",
      "The unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds is \"slowly but steadily rising,\" said Elise Gould, an economist at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"I was quickly humbled\"",
      "Matthew McMeans, who graduated from the University of Memphis last year, estimates he applied to roughly 500 jobs during an 18-month job search before landing a position as a full stack software engineer in early August. He described the job hunt as \"miserable\" and \"degrading\" given the difficulty in landing interviews.",
      "\"When I started my degree, the hopes were really high that you were going to get multiple offers when you graduated,\" the 23-year-old said. \"But as soon as I started really searching and applying, I was quickly humbled.\"",
      "The wobbly labor market has caught the attention of the Federal Reserve, which has a so-called dual mandate to keep both unemployment and inflation low. Last month, the central bank\u00a0cut interest rates for the first time since December 2024 in an effort to bolster the labor market.",
      "But even if the job market improves, for many the damage has already been done. Whitlock, the IT professional who has been unemployed for almost a year, said she's managed to get assistance through programs like SNAP, better known as food stamps, and to negotiate down her cell phone and car insurance bills.",
      "But she was also forced to liquidate her retirement fund and a small investment account to make sure she had enough to live on.",
      "Said Whitlock, \"I'm probably right now in a position where I've got maybe three months until I'm in a really bad spot.\"",

      "The demands are outlined in a nine-page document, title the \"Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,\" that asks schools to freeze their tuition rate for five years, ban the use of sex and gender as factors in their admissions process, and cap their international student numbers, among other requirements.",
      "Signatories also must commit to \"transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas,\" according to the memo.",
      "According to a White House official, a letter outlining the plan and a copy of the agreement were sent on Wednesday to the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California, University of Texas, University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University.",
      "The official declined to say whether the Trump administration plans to make a similar offer to other colleges.",
      "The agreement was\u00a0first reported\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal. May Mailman, a senior adviser for special projects at the White House, told the paper that the Trump administration doesn't plan to limit funding only to institutions that agree to abide by the compact. However, schools that sign the agreement will be granted priority in receiving federal funding and engaging with White House officials.",
      "\"Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,\" the agreement states.",
      "A copy of the letter sent to universities obtained by CBS News notes that schools that agree to the compact will receive \"allowance for increased overhead payments where feasible, substantial and meaningful federal grants, and other federal partnerships.\"",
      "The letter is signed by Mailman; Secretary of Education Linda McMahon; and Vince Haley, director of the White House's Domestic Policy Council. It asks for written comments from the universities by \"no later than October 20.\"",

      "The Department of Education did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",

      "A University of Virginia spokesperson said its interim president, Paul G. Mahoney, has created a working group to advise him on how to respond to the letter. \"The University has not yet made any decision regarding the compact,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The University of Southern California said it is reviewing the letter. In a statement to CBS News, Vanderbilt said that \"We look forward to carefully reviewing the compact and providing meaningful feedback to the administration.\" MIT acknowledged receiving the material but declined further comment.",
      "The other universities did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Thursday, the University of Pennsylvania chapter of the American Association of University Professors said the White House letter amounts to a threat.",
      "\"Penn must not allow itself to be threatened into ceding its self-determination,\" the group said. \"Whatever the consequences of refusal, agreeing would threaten the very mission of the university.\"",
      "The agreement places a cap on foreign student enrollment, which it states cannot exceed 15% of a university's undergraduate population. Also, no more than 5% of foreign students enrolled at a college can come from a single country.",
      "\"Universities that rely on foreign students to fund their institutions risk, among other things, potentially reducing spots available to deserving American students,\" the document states.",
      "The nine schools are also asked to freeze tuition for five years and to waive tuition for students pursuing \"hard science programs\" at institutions where the endowment exceeds $2 million per undergraduate student. Schools would not have to freeze tuition for students from \"families of exceptional means,\" under the agreement.",
      "The letter represents the latest attempt by the Trump administration to reshape the nation's higher education system. The administration has targeted high-profile universities in recent months, threatening to pull federal funding if they do not agree to certain concessions on combating antisemitism and changing their diversity practices.",
      "Columbia University in July agreed to pay the administration $200 million to resolve an investigation into alleged violations of anti-discrimination laws. The Trump administration earlier this year also suspended roughly $2 billion in federal funding earmarked for Harvard University over what the White House said was the school's failure to crack down on antisemitism on its campus.

    "summary": "The $500,000-apiece ad campaigns take direct aim at the Republican nominee for governor of New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli, and the GOP candidate in Virginia, Winsome Earle-Sears.",
    "story": [
      "VoteVets, a liberal group that typically backs veterans running for office, is pouring $1 million into aggressive ad campaigns backing the Democratic candidates in Virginia's and New Jersey's gubernatorial contests with less than 30 days until Election Day.",
      "Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor of New Jersey, is a former Navy helicopter pilot. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for the same job in Virginia, was a CIA operations officer before entering politics.",
      "The $500,000-apiece ad campaigns take direct aim at the Republican nominee for governor of New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli, and the GOP candidate in Virginia, Winsome Earle-Sears. VoteVets says both ads feature veterans of the armed services discussing economic difficulties and alleging a GOP governor would make things worse for them.",
      "\"After a decade of Coast Guard rescues, I came home to make a go of it. But Jersey is so damn expensive right now,\" a Coast Guard veteran says in the New Jersey ad. \"And Jack Ciattarelli will make it worse. He already voted to raise property taxes and was even talking about a 10% sales tax.\"",
      "Ciattarelli has pushed back on allegations that he supports raising the state's sales tax to 10%, a claim also made in ads paid for by his Democratic opponent's campaign. He says his comments were taken out of context.",
      "\"Mikie Sherrill and her allies are lying about Jack,\" a spokesperson for Ciattarelli said in a statement. \"As governor, he has a plan to cut taxes for working and middle class New Jerseyans, while Mikie Sherrill has a history of voting to raise taxes again and again in Congress.\"",
      "In the Virginia ad, a Navy veteran attempts to connect Earle-Sears to President Trump's economic policies, although she has not been endorsed by the president.",
      "\"Instead of fighting for Virginia, Winsome Earle-Seals went right along with the Trump budget that's raising our costs even higher,\" the veteran says in the ad. \"Health care. Housing. Electricity. And those tariffs, driving up prices on just about everything else.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Ciattarelli and Earle-Sears' campaigns for comment and will update this story if they respond.",
      "VoteVets placed a separate half-million-dollar ad campaign supporting Spanberger in August, and the group's political action committee directly invested another $500,000 into her campaign earlier in the cycle.",
      "VoteVets additionally transferred nearly $80,000 to the Democratic Party of New Jersey and launched a $100,000 cable ad buy in the contest for Virginia's 64th state House district.",
      "Virginia and New Jersey are two of the only states to hold statewide elections a year after the presidential race, so their gubernatorial contests are typically closely watched \u2014 and are often treated as referenda on the newly elected president.",
      "Both races have heated up significantly in recent weeks, with news stories threatening to upend the contests.",
      "In New Jersey, legal threats linger over the contest after CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives admitted to releasing a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records to a Ciattarelli ally, including her Social Security number and other private information. Sherrill has alleged her records were released intentionally, which Ciatarelli's campaign has denied. Sherrill has also faced attacks from the right seeking to link her to the 1994 Naval Academy cheating scandal \u2014 she was not accused of cheating, and she says her only involvement was her failure to inform on her classmates.",
      "Meanwhile in Virginia, Spanberger has faced attacks after Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones admitted he sent text messages in 2022 that contained violent and inflammatory language about several Republicans.",
      "Spanberger condemned Jones's violent rhetoric, but she has faced criticism from the right for not calling on him to drop out of the race. Earle-Sears's campaign also released an ad connecting Spanberger to Jones.",

    "summary": "Matt Van Epps has won a crowded Republican primary in a Tennessee special House election, after securing President Trump's endorsement.",
    "story": [
      "Matt Van Epps is projected to win a crowded Republican primary Tuesday in the special election to replace a former Tennessee GOP congressman, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Van Epps will face off in December against Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn, who is projected to win a four-way primary for the Democratic nomination.",
      "Van Epps clinched the GOP victory following an endorsement from President Trump that came after in-person early voting ended. Eleven Republicans were on the ballot for the seat vacated by former Rep. Mark Green, who resigned over the summer due to \"an opportunity in the private sector that was too exciting to pass up.\" Among them, two candidates suspended their campaigns after Mr. Trump weighed in and joined the president in endorsing Van Epps.",
      "\"Thank you to the people of Middle and West Tennessee! Our Donald J. Trump-endorsed campaign won in a landslide tonight,\" Van Epps said on social media. \"Now, on to December 2nd! We're going to win the general and keep this seat RED!\"",
      "If Republicans hold onto the seat, it would slightly expand their margin in the U.S. House, where the GOP holds a single-digit majority. The general election in December could also gauge the popularity of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, especially with Republican-leaning suburban voters in the Nashville area.",
      "The 7th Congressional District spans 14 counties, bordering both Kentucky and Alabama. Along with parts of Nashville, it includes rural areas, wealthy suburbs and part of a military installation, Fort Campbell. The seat is one of three districts that GOP lawmakers drew as safely red in 2022 by dividing left-leaning Nashville. Its voters elected Green by 21 percentage points in 2024 and by nearly 22 points in 2022.",
      "Of its nine seats in the House, Tennessee currently has one Democrat, Rep. Steve Cohen of Memphis. Republican redistricting in 2022 allowed the GOP to flip another Democratic seat that was drawn to include only part of Nashville.",
      "Van Epps previously served in several roles under Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee. During the primary campaign, Van Epps leaned into his military experience, including as a Tennessee Army National Guard lieutenant colonel and as an Army Special Operations helicopter pilot. Among the competitors he defeated were state Reps. Jody Barrett and Gino Bulso.",
      "Behn is a social worker and community organizer who has focused on women's reproductive health rights, including as a plaintiff in a lawsuit against a Tennessee law banning adults from helping minors get an abortion without parental permission. A judge has halted the provision's enforcement.",
      "Mr. Trump endorsed Van Epps in a Truth Social post late last week that praised him as an \"America First Patriot.\"",
      "\"A West Point Graduate, and Combat Decorated Army Helicopter Pilot, Matt knows the WISDOM and COURAGE required to Defend our Country, Support our Incredible Military/Veterans, and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The nod from Mr. Trump followed Van Epps' prior endorsements from Lee, Green and Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.",
      "Outside groups spent more than $3.1 million on the race, almost all on the GOP side, with about $1.1 million opposing Barrett.",
      "The Republican primary contenders praised Mr. Trump and expressed staunch opposition to anything perceived as liberal or \"woke.\" Meanwhile, in the Democratic primary, the four candidates attacked the legislation Mr. Trump dubbed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" in addition to his tariffs.",

After the USFL folded, Walker played in the NFL for more than a decade.",

    "story": [
      "California's controversial plan to redraw its congressional maps mid-decade is among the most pressing issues discussed by\u00a0candidates in the 2026 gubernatorial race.",
      "Proposition 50, placed on the ballot by the state legislature for a November special election, would authorize California lawmakers to redraw the state's congressional districts.",
      "The redistricting effort, backed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, is aimed at sending more Democrats to Congress by redrawing\u00a0five of the state's districts for U.S. House seats\u00a0to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm elections. California Democrats call it a countermeasure to President Trump's push for\u00a0Texas' recent redistricting, which favors Republicans in the midterms.",
      "Unlike in Texas, California voters took the power to draw these maps away from lawmakers in 2020 and established an\u00a0independent redistricting commission.\u00a0Proposition 50 would give that power back to lawmakers for the next five years, through the next presidential election.",
      "Over several weeks in September, CBS News California Investigates sat down with each candidate to ask questions on a variety of issues that matter to voters, including Proposition 50.",
      "While Democratic candidates generally backed Proposition 50 along party lines, some admitted unease when pressed on the controversial partisan details. Republican and Green Party opponents defended their opposition as they responded to arguments in favor of the measure.",
      "What do you think of the governor's plan?",
      "Former Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who served as Health and Human Services Secretary in the Biden administration, defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington, saying it would \"make sure that Donald Trump doesn't put his thumb on the scale on the votes in Congress.\"",
      "Republican candidate Steve Hilton condemned the plan, saying outright that it is \"totally corrupt and it's unconstitutional and it is illegal.\"",
      "\"Politicians shouldn't draw their own maps,\" Hilton said. \"I mean, that's obviously wrong and corrupt. Common sense tells you that.\"",
      "Former state Assemblymember Ian Calderon, also a Democrat, said he supports the plan and emphasized California's position as a donor state.",
      "\"At the end of the day, if we're going to have hope of any type of leverage throughout the next couple of years during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress, so that we could fight back and secure the money that is coming to California,\" Calderon said.",
      "However, he acknowledged unease with the Democratic gerrymandering and noted that his wife vehemently opposed Prop 50. \u00a0\"She thinks that districts should be drawn by independent redistricting commissions and that it is wrong for the state to be putting its finger on the scale, Calderon said.",
      "Republican candidate Leo Zacky called the proposal \"unconstitutional,\" criticizing Democratic lawmakers for redrawing the independent redistricting commission's maps for their own partisan purposes.",
      "\"The way that it's set up is that we, the people, are supposed to figure out how the districts are supposed to be drawn,\" he said. \"[Newsom is] violating the Constitution. He's spending a ton of money doing it. It's trash. It's a waste.\"",
      "Green Party candidate Butch Ware accused Democrats of consolidating power under the guise of fighting Republican overreach.",
      "\"In the state of California, are y'all feeling that this has been a state that has been well-run and for your best interest? So you're going to essentially hand them the keys to make sure that they own every district in the state? You imagine thinking that you can fight fascism with fascism,\" Ware said.",
      "While Democratic former State Controller Betty Yee called the redistricting effort \"essential\" to prevent the manipulation of elections, \"as the president has asked the state of Texas to do.\"",
      "\"We have a process for this. It's after every decennial census\u2026 And just the idea that there is manipulation that is being directed from the top, that's going to affect California's representation, our proportionate representation,\" Yee said. \"We have to fight that.\"",
      "Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, who is running as a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is California's opportunity to counter \"gerrymandering coming out of states like Texas.\"",
      "\"Not only will it give voters something better and the chance to gain five new Democratic seats. We're doing it in a way that is transparent,\" he said. \"We're going to do it in a way that lets the voters decide.\"",
      "Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, also a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is a necessary response to Republican attempts to rig elections elsewhere.",
      "\"Let the people decide, and I'm for it. I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do,\" Villaraigosa said.",
      "Businessman Steve Cloobeck, a Democrat, supported the plan and said \"we have to preserve Democracy.\" Another Democrat, Katie Porter, who's a law professor and former member of Congress, said she is in \"support of the governor's plan.\"",
      "Republican Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County expressed opposition.",
      "\"It's like saying murder is not acceptable, so I'm going to go murder you,\" Bianco said. \"Let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more.\"",
      "Message to Californians who voted for Trump",
      "The Democratic candidates also explained their message   to the roughly 40% of California voters who supported Donald Trump in 2020, voters whose political representation could be diminished under the new district maps.",
      "Becerra said he would talk to them \"straight out\" and emphasized his intention to win every vote. Becerra also emphasized that now is the time to stand up for the rule of law and Democracy.",
      "\"No one should do power grabs. No one is a king. No one has a right to deny you your vote,\" he said.",
      "Like Becerra, Calderon said his campaign would focus on listening to all voters, not just talking at them.",
      "\"There are a lot of Republicans in the state who don't necessarily love everything Trump is doing,\" Calderon said. \"They just want to be heard.\"",
      "Thurmond echoed similar arguments, saying that many of Mr. Trump's voters may not support all of the president's policies.",
      "\"Most Americans do not support attacks on the immigrant communities or education cuts,\" he said. \"Just because they voted for Trump doesn't mean they agree with everything.\"",
      "Yee acknowledged that some voters, particularly in rural Republican districts, may feel disenfranchised.",
      "\"What I will say to them also is, look, these are areas of the state that actually want to become vital economies. These are areas that actually have probably disproportionate rates of people on Medicaid. These are parts of the states where people are relying on food assistance more than probably other parts,\" Yee said. \"I would just say, who's going to best represent those interests when those cuts are upon you?\"",
      "Businessman Steve Cloobeck emphasized loyalty to California's interests rather than party politics.",
      "\"I would look at the polls of the state right now. The polls say protect California. Whatever the California customers want, I will be their leader and represent them,\" Cloobeck said.",
      "Villaraigosa said he expects to alienate some voters on both sides, but believes many are still looking for leadership that bridges divides.",
      "\"I know there are Democrats that I might alienate in the course of this race, and there will be Republicans I alienate. There will also be Democrats and some Republicans that want a leader who's a uniter who wants to work with both sides, who wants the focus on common sense. So you win a few, you lose a few.\"",
      "Porter, who has represented a swing district in Orange County, was the only candidate\u00a0to refuse to directly answer the question, taking issue with the premise that she might need republican voters to win.",
      "\"How would I need them in order to win?\" Porter asked. \"If it is me versus a Republican, I think that I will win the people who did not vote for Trump.\"",
      "As several of her opponents noted, in\u00a0California's top-two open primary\u00a0system, Republican voters could help put a Democratic candidate over the top.",
      "Porter then threatened to call off the interview, taking issue with too many follow-up questions. She ultimately stayed and continued answering questions.",
      "The Republican and Green Party Proposition 50 opponents also defended their opposition to pro-redistricting arguments.",
      "Do two wrongs make a right?",
      "The candidates also confronted the ethical dilemma\u00a0that even some Prop 50 supporters acknowledge: Does fighting one partisan maneuver with another set the wrong precedent? In other words, do two wrongs make right?",
      "\"It's let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more,\" Bianco said.",
      "Becerra defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington.",
      "\"Donald Trump is afraid he's going to lose his slim majority of Republicans come 2026,\" Becerra said. \"So he's trying to rig the process to give himself more Republicans. That is not a Democratic process. We're going to fight as we need to make sure our votes count.\"",
      "Calderon offered a conflicted view, calling it \"kind of a sh---- choice\" but emphasizing the political stakes.",
      "\"If we're going to have hope of any type of leverage during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress.\"",
      "Ware warned voters not to fall for partisan manipulation.",
      "\"This doesn't serve the voters of California. It serves the DNC. It does not help us. It helps them,\" Ware said. \"They are using Californians essentially as a prop in their battle between Democrats and Republicans.\"",
      "Porter said it's not two wrongs, highlighting the nature in which Texas approached its redistricting.",
      "\"What Texas is doing is acting out of the course of the census, not following new census data\u2026 They're doing it because Donald Trump instructed them to do it,\" she said.",
      "Villaraigosa said he's for letting the people decide on the matter to challenge corruption.",
      "\"I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do,\" he said.",
      "Thurmond called the special election on Proposition 50 \"an important moment for voters to decide.\"",
      "Yee reaffirmed her stance on California's move to counter Texas' redistricting effort.",
      "\"Just the idea that there's manipulation that is being directed from the top that's going to affect California's proportionate representation, we have to fight back,\" she said.",
      "Cloobeck also highlighted California's position as a donor state.",
      "\"Donald Trump's actions have been such that he wants to just attack California. He has not shown us any gratitude for all the billions of dollars of tax dollars the federal government gets from California,\" he said.",
      "Hilton described the difficulty California faces in properly redrawing its congressional districts mid-decade rather than after the federal census every 10 years.",
      "\"By drawing these maps in the middle, they don't know who lives where,\" he said. \"Millions of people have left California. In Los Angeles, whole communities have burned down. Who knows who lives there? There's no way that they can honor that constitutional requirement.\"",
      "Hilton stressed that even before Newsom's redistricting effort, California already had \"a massively distorted political map.\"",
      "Acknowledging that Republicans make up about 40% of the vote in California but have just 17% of the congressional seats, Hilton said, \"With this new plan that they've got, it would be down to 6%.\"",
      "Hilton argued that those voters are being pushed out of representation altogether, saying that the plan would unfairly increase the weight of Democratic votes by as much as eight times compared to Republican ones.",
      "\"We're completely violating the principle of equal protection, the whole idea,\" Hilton said.",
      "While candidates differ sharply on Proposition 50, voters will have the final say. The redistricting plan will go before voters in a special election on November 4. If approved, the new congressional maps would remain intact through the 2028 presidential election, until 2030.",

    "summary": "Unlawful crossings on the southern border have hit a 55-year low, according to figures obtained by CBS News \u2014 as President Trump cracks down on illegal immigration.",
    "story": [
      "Unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2025 plummeted to the lowest annual level since the early 1970s, amid the Trump administration's sweeping clampdown on illegal immigration, internal federal statistics obtained by CBS News show.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol agents recorded nearly 238,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border illegally in fiscal year 2025, which began in October of last year and ended on Sept. 30, according to the preliminary Department of Homeland Security data, which has not been previously reported.",
      "The number is the lowest annual tally recorded by Border Patrol since fiscal year 1970, when the agency reported roughly 202,000 apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border, historical figures indicate.",
      "It also represents a seismic change from the record-high levels of Border Patrol apprehensions recorded under the Biden administration, which faced an unprecedented humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. In fiscal year 2022, Border Patrol made 2.2 million apprehensions there \u2014 a record, and almost 10 times the levels recorded in 2025.",
      "More than 60% of the apprehensions made by Border Patrol in fiscal year 2025 along the U.S.-Mexico border were recorded in the last full three months of the Biden administration, the preliminary data shows. Government fiscal years start in October and end in September, and some of them encompass different administrations.",
      "Over President Trump's first full eight months in office, Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border have recorded fewer than 9,000 apprehensions each month \u2014 a number that the agency recorded in 24-hour periods during some days under former President Joe Biden.",
      "The internal DHS figures show Border Patrol made nearly 8,400 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border in September, an increase from 6,300 in August and 4,600 in July, a monthly record low.",
      "Border Patrol apprehensions denote the number of times agents intercepted and processed migrants entering the country between official ports of entry, which is illegal. Some migrants can be counted multiple times, if they attempt to enter the U.S. more than once after being turned back to Mexico.",
      "In a statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"President Trump has overwhelmingly delivered on his promise to secure our Southern Border.\"",
      "\"As a result, Americans are safer \u2014 unvetted criminal illegal aliens and dangerous drugs are no longer pouring over our border unchecked,\" Jackson added. \"And for all the Democrats who claimed it was impossible to secure the border or that they needed new policy, turns out all we needed was a new President.\"",
      "\"A new normal\"",
      "Ariel Ruiz Soto, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, noted that illegal border crossings began to fall sharply in the summer of 2024, after the Biden administration enacted strict limits on asylum. But he said the Trump administration had set \"a new normal\" for migration flows in just a few months.",
      "Ruiz Soto said the Trump administration's stringent policies \u2014 at the border and inside the U.S. \u2014 \"have had a significant effect on people being deterred from coming illegally to the United States.\"",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump took office for a second time, his administration moved to seal and militarize the southern border, closing down the American asylum system using emergency powers, dispatching thousands of soldiers to repel illegal crossings and shutting down Biden-era programs that allowed some migrants to enter the U.S. legally.",
      "While parts of the asylum ban have been curtailed and declared illegal by courts, the Trump administration has virtually ended the practice of releasing migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally, deporting them quickly or holding them in detention while their cases are reviewed.",
      "Beyond the border, the Trump administration has staged highly publicized operations targeting those living in the U.S. illegally, dispatching teams of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents across the country with the objective of overseeing a deportation campaign of unprecedented proportions.",
      "The crackdown has not been without controversy. The administration's border policies have been denounced as inhumane, draconian and illegal by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged them in federal court on the grounds that they are at odds with U.S. and international asylum law as well as the Constitution.",
      "The federal immigration raids well beyond the border have also triggered significant backlash, particularly in major American cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, where large-scale protests have erupted. National and local Democrats have decried the raids as indiscriminate and overly harsh, accusing the Trump administration of not solely focusing on deporting violent offenders.",
      "Citing confrontations and instances of violence, Mr. Trump in recent days has ordered National Guard troops to deploy to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, to protect immigration agents and facilities there. A federal judge has so far blocked the plan to send National Guard units to Portland.",
      "Amid the national debate over immigration enforcement, those living along the southern border say there's no denying the reality on the ground has changed markedly.",
      "John Martin said his network of shelters in the Texas border city of El Paso housed hundreds of migrants during spikes in illegal crossings during the Biden administration. On Monday, he said his organization was not housing a single migrant, saying he's received \"little to no\" new arrivals who are not local homeless residents in recent months. He attributed it to Mr. Trump's crackdown.",
      "\"If the goal is to decrease the number of individuals, I would say that appears to have been successful, without getting into the politics about whether or not I like it or dislike it,\" Martin said. \"We're just simply not seeing the people.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Oct 2025 20:14:23 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard a challenge to a Colorado law banning \"conversion therapy\" for minors that was brought by a licensed counselor in the state.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday grappled with a\u00a0Colorado counselor's challenge to the state's ban on \"conversion therapy\" for minors.",
      "The case was brought by Kaley Chiles, who argued the state's restriction unconstitutionally censors conversations about gender dysphoria and sexual orientation that she seeks to have with young patients. Chiles, who is Christian, said she wants to engage in talk therapy with minor clients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body.\"",
      "But she said she fears that having those conversations with young patients puts her at risk of violating Colorado's law. Lower courts ruled against Chiles, finding Colorado's law regulates professional conduct.",
      "An issue at the center of the dispute, known as Chiles v. Salazar, is whether Colorado's ban regulates Chiles' professional conduct or her speech. Shannon Stevenson, Colorado's solicitor general, told the justices its law only regulates medical treatments and practices provided by a counselors licensed by the state. Jim Campbell, who argued on behalf of Chiles, told the court that the law seeks to transform therapists into \"mouthpieces for the government.\"",
      "Colorado's conversion therapy ban",
      "Called the Minor Conversion Therapy Law, Colorado's ban was enacted in 2019 and prohibits mental health professionals from engaging in any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\"",
      "Violators face fines of up to $5,000 and risk being suspended from practicing or stripped of their license. Colorado is one of more than 20 states that have enacted bans on \"conversion therapy.\"",
      "Several years after Colorado's law took effect, Chiles sued state licensing officials, arguing that the ban violates her free speech rights by censoring her conversations with patients based on viewpoint and the content of those discussions.",
      "Colorado has not taken any disciplinary action against Chiles or any other licensed therapist for violating the ban, it said in court papers, and the state asserts that the talk therapy Chiles' aims to provide wouldn't defy its law because she expressly doesn't seek to change a patient's gender identity or sexual orientation.",
      "\"The only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor's sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\" they wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.",
      "But Campbell told the court that anonymous complaints have been filed against Chiles in recent weeks that the state is now investigating. He argued that there remains a \"credible threat of enforcement\" against her.",
      "At least two of the justices appeared skeptical of Colorado's interpretation of the law and its claim that Chiles would not be violating it with the types of discussions she wants to have with patients. Justice Neil Gorsuch called the state's reading of the law \"peculiar,\" while Justice Samuel Alito questioned how Stevenson \"can square your interpretation\" of the law with its plain meaning.",
      "Campbell argued that Colorado's ban forbids licensed counselors from helping minors pursue \"state disfavored goals\" on issues of gender and sexuality. The law prevents families and teens who want to address gender dysphoria by aligning identity and sex from working with a licensed counselor to help reach that goal. But practices that provide assistance to patients undergoing gender transition are allowed under the law, he said.",
      "The law \"undermines the well-being\" of children struggling with gender dysphoria by restricting their access to certain kinds of talk therapy, Campbell said, and he argued Chiles is being \"silenced\" every day that Colorado's ban can be enforced against her.",
      "\"The Free Speech Clause forbids the State from censoring mutual conversations on important topics. This includes discussions between counselors and clients on deeply personal issues,\" lawyers with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal advocacy group that is representing Chiles, wrote in filings. \"Colorado's viewpoint-based intrusion into the counseling room is unconstitutional.\"",
      "Campbell argued that the high court \"has recognized many times\" that one-on-one conversation, which is Chiles' method of treatment, is a form of speech.",
      "\"She's encouraging them to achieve their goals,\" he said of Chiles' discussions with clients, adding that \"this is an ongoing active dialogue\" that \"absolutely has to be protected\" by the First Amendment.",
      "But state officials said there is a long history of states regulating the health care profession to protect patients from harmful practices, and the First Amendment has never barred states from doing that. Colorado pointed to medical malpractice laws and other licensing regimes, which lawyers said have long covered mental health and other treatments performed with words.",
      "Stevenson, who argued on behalf of Colorado, said its law is a \"reasonable regulation\" of professional conduct. She told the justices that therapists have a fiduciary duty to protect their clients from substandard care.",
      "Additionally, they have argued conversion therapy is ineffective and associated with depression, anxiety, loss of faith and suicidality, regardless of how it is performed. Major medical associations have warned that efforts to change a patient's sexual orientation or gender identity are potentially harmful to young people and not supported by credible scientific evidence.",
      "Colorado officials also refuted Chiles' claim that the state is trying to tamp down on certain speech \u2014 discouraging gender transition \u2014 that it disfavors.",
      "\"At no time has the First Amendment been understood to confer on professionals a constitutional right to use words to deliver treatment that violates the standard of care,\" they argued.",
      "During the arguments, Alito asked Stevenson if a post-adolescent male is attracted to other males and wants a therapist's help in ending or lessening that attraction, would that be banned under Colorado's statute?",
      "Stevenson said it turns on whether the purpose of the treatment is to change the individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. If the patient wanted a counselor's help to become straight, that would be banned, she acknowledged, but if the patient were being advised on how to cope with his sexuality, that would be allowed.",
      "She argued that there are harms that result from conversion therapy, which posits that \"you can change this innate thing about yourself.\"",
      "Both Alito and Justice Elena Kagan raised the possibility that applying the statute could result in viewpoint discrimination. Kagan said that if we're in \"normal free speech-land \u2026 rather than in this kind of doctor-land,\" if the male in Alito's example identifies as gay and is told by a therapist that he'll be helped to accept that, that is acceptable. But if the male is told we're \"going to help you change,\" that is not.",
      "\"One of those is permissible and the other is not, that seems like viewpoint discrimination in the way we would normally understand viewpoint discrimination,\" she said.",
      "Stevenson said she agreed, but said it underscored why medical treatment has to be treated differently.",
      "Colorado lawyers and those backing the state have also warned that if Chiles' prevails, it would destabilize longstanding health care regulation and gut states' power to ensure mental health professionals adhere to the standard of care.",
      "The Trump administration is backing Chiles in the case, but told the Supreme Court in a filing that it should send the case back to lower courts to take another look at the law.",
      "\"Colorado is muzzling one side of an ongoing debate in the mental-health community about how to discuss questions of gender and sexuality with children,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing. \"Under the First Amendment, the State bears a heavy burden to justify that content-based restriction on protected speech.\"",
      "A few justices, including Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson, raised the idea of sending the case back to the lower courts to review the Colorado law under strict scrutiny, the most demanding level of judicial review. Why wouldn't we do that? Jackson asked Campbell.",
      "He responded that Chiles continues to suffer irreparable harm and \"is being silenced\" because of concerns she could violate Colorado's ban, while children who need help are \"being left without support.\"",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:35:00 -0400",
    "summary": "DNI Tulsi Gabbard issued a directive to review polygraph policies and curb press leaks, echoing actions taken by the Bush and Obama administrations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard in the last month issued a memo ordering U.S. intelligence agencies to conduct a review of whether random polygraph examinations of their employees or contractors are feasible.",
      "At the same time, the directive emphasizes the need for tests to include questions about whether employees or potential applicants have leaked information to members of the press as part of the standard battery of questions during the security clearance adjudication process, CBS News has learned.",
      "While questions related to leaks have been commonplace for U.S. intelligence community employees and applicants, the Trump administration is intensifying efforts to curb disclosures of classified and sensitive information by warning intelligence community members they'll face additional scrutiny over leaks to media outlets. In many ways, Gabbard's directive echoes earlier hard-line stances undertaken by previous administrations of both political parties to root out sources of revelations that were either potentially damaging to national security or politically embarrassing.",
      "Two sources familiar with Gabbard's memo said that the directive emphasizes polygraph test questions related to leaks of information to the press and said the tests would become more routine in conjunction with counterintelligence investigations. The officials, who spoke to CBS News under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that while the U.S. government has a responsibility to safeguard its information, the mandate could stem the flow of information the public has the right to know, even if it's unclassified.",
      "An official with the Office of Director of National Intelligence, known as ODNI, told CBS News that while the directive does reinforce questions related to leaks to members of the press, Gabbard's memo does not establish new policies, but instead emphasizes existing regulations and legal statutes. The directive also does not direct agencies to begin random polygraph examinations but instead asks agencies within the U.S. intelligence community to review the feasibility of conducting random polygraphs in conjunction with counterintelligence investigations.",
      "The official said the review is based on internal U.S. intelligence community findings that indicated a lack of polygraph examinations has emboldened former U.S. intelligence community members to spy on behalf of U.S. adversaries. The ODNI official was unable to provide further details on the study or when it was conducted. The official emphasized that Gabbard's directive does not order additional screenings.",
      "Her directive is emblematic of a return to the aggressive approach taken under the Obama administration following the massive disclosure of classified information to journalists by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. In 2014, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper instructed federal agencies to question applicants and employees about whether they had shared classified material with the news media, according to the McClatchy news service, which obtained Clapper's policy directive under a Freedom of Information Act request.",
      "Both the Obama and Bush administrations were heavily criticized for launching FBI investigations that targeted journalists' government sources and using the Espionage Act, a law enacted shortly after the U.S. entered World War I to prosecute spies and traitors, to successfully convict government officials who leaked confidential information to journalists. Both administrations ordered additional polygraph examinations and employed aggressive tactics to find leakers, seizing phone and email records of reporters and intelligence community members.",
      "\"Since the start of President Trump's second term, we have seen numerous unauthorized disclosures of classified information, which have the potential to damage U.S. strategic alliances and credibility and endanger sources and methods vital to intelligence gathering,\" DNI spokesperson Olivia Coleman told CBS News.",
      "She added, \"The fact that deep state actors leaked information about DNI Gabbard's directive, aimed at preventing leaks and protecting classified information, to the media is both deeply ironic and a powerful reminder of why her efforts to identify and deter leakers is urgently necessary.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Gabbard said she made criminal referrals regarding two cases to the Justice Department, with a third on its way, which included an illegal leak of information to The Washington Post about the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "While Gabbard's mandate reinforces policies implemented by previous administrations and existing legal statutes, it could generate a fresh round of criticism echoing what previous administrations faced over press freedoms and the relationship between journalists and government sources.",
      "Critics have historically argued that these types of policy directives are intended to create a chilling effect between national security reporters and U.S. government whistleblowers. Activists have said it's problematic to prosecute officials who leak to the press under the same law \u2014 the Espionage Act \u2014 used to prosecute spies and traitors.",
      "\"This is an obnoxious flexing of bureaucratic muscle by yet another Trump agency head seeking to intimidate and abuse their workforce. Gabbard has the authority to impose this requirement, but it's a serious waste of finite resources that will do little but force out a few officials and disrupt agency operations in the interim,\" Bradley Moss, a national security attorney, who specializes in national security and the security clearance process told CBS News.",
      "Moss is a partner at the Washington, D.C., law office of Mark Zaid, whose clearance was stripped in March by President Trump following an executive order. Zaid, who filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in May to have his security clearance restored, had represented a whistleblower key to Mr. Trump's first impeachment.",
      "\"Everyone should keep an eye on those officials who are exempt from this requirement and how closely politically aligned they are with Gabbard,\" said Moss.",
      "Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported last week that the Pentagon is planning to implement widespread random polygraph testing while also requiring service members, civilian employees and contract workers within the Office of the Defense Secretary and the Joint Staff to sign a nondisclosure agreement, according to two unnamed people familiar with the proposal and documents obtained by the newspaper.",
      "In response to the reporting by the Post last week, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told CBS News: \"The Washington Post's reporting is untrue and irresponsible anonymously sourced garbage.\"",

With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down Wednesday morning after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "summary": "Illinois and Chicago have sued the Trump administration to block deployment of the National Guard to Chicago, though it was revealed in court that troops are already on the way.",
    "story": [
      "As Illinois and Chicago filed suit to block the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, a judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order Monday afternoon, and it was revealed that troops are already on their way.",
      "\"The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president's favor,\" the lawsuit states in its introduction.",
      "In the lawsuit, which names both the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago as plaintiffs, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul writes, \"Defendants' deployment of federalized troops to Illinois is patently unlawful.\" He continues, \"Plaintiffs ask this court to halt the illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional federalization of members of the National Guard of the United States, including both the Illinois and Texas National Guard.\"",
      "Raoul is asking for a temporary restraining order, saying deployment will cause \"additional unrest,\" \"mistrust of police,\" and harm to the state's economy.",
      "In court, defense attorneys in this case were asked a series of logistical questions, like what cities in Illinois the National Guard would be deployed and they couldn't provide the answers.",
      "The judge said that while she was troubled by the lack of information and details of the operation, she will give those attorneys a couple more days to respond. She did caution lawyers for the Trump administration, \"If I were the federal government, I'd take a pause on this.\"",
      "The judge did not issue a restraining order during Monday's status hearing, instead setting another hearing for arguments on Thursday.",
      "However, it was revealed in court that National Guard troops from Texas are already on their way to Illinois and could be deployed as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday. The Illinois National Guard was ordered to report on Tuesday for training, according to state attorneys.",
      "In a Monday afternoon news conference, Pritzker repeatedly decried what he called the Trump administration's \"unconstitutional invasion\" of Chicago, and said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials are expanding raids and military-style enforcement actions in order to sow chaos that would then justify the deployment of military troops to Chicago.",
      "\"The state of Illinois is going to use every lever at our disposal to resist this power grab and get Noem's thugs the hell out of Chicago,\" Pritzker said. \"I am not afraid. I am not\u00a0afraid. And I will not back down.\"",
      "\"The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military,\" said AG Raoul. \"Particularly for the reason that their city or state leadership have fallen out of the president's political favor.\"",
      "Raoul said the state has filed more than 40 lawsuits against the Trump administration so far. He cited the militia clauses of the U.S. Constitution, which give Congress the sole authority to decide where troops are deployed, and the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits military troops from participating in civilian law enforcement.",
      "\"It is unfair to National Guardsmen, it is unfair to local law enforcement, and it is certainly unfair to the law-abiding citizens of Illinois who do not want to be subject to military occupation,\" Raul said.",
      "Raoul said the only situation in the city or state that is \"out of control\" are the ICE agent,s whose overreach he said creates pretext for military deployment, and cited President Trump's own statements that he wants to use American cities as military training grounds and said Chicago \"is about to find out why it's called the Department of War.\"",
      "\"I'm here to say that the president's actions are illegal,\" Raoul said. \"The president has failed to establish that any of the legal prerequisites exist for his efforts to mobilize his National Guard troops here.\"",
      "Mayor Brandon Johnson said the lawsuit sends \"a message to the president that Chicago will not be used as a political prop. Chicago will not be intimidated and will not be silent.\"",
      "\"Our city has faced tough times before, and every time we stood strong, because we stood together,\" Johnson said. \"Let's continue to work together to protect our democracy and fight for the future of our country.\"",
      "U.S. Senators for Illinois Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth released a statement in conjunction with other Illinois Democrats, demanding Mr. Trump reverse his decision to deploy National Guard troops.",
      "\"We write to urge you to reverse your reckless decision to federalize and deploy Texas and Illinois National Guard troops to Illinois.\u00a0 Your use of the military to sow fear and chaos in American cities, including over the objections of several Governors, is unconstitutional and un-American, infringes on individual and states' rights, and threatens to undermine military readiness and morale,\" wrote the lawmakers in part.",
      "Over the weekend, a\u00a0federal memo obtained by CBS News\u00a0revealed up to 300 members of the Illinois National Guard would be federalized and deployed to \"protect federal property\" and \"government personnel performing federal functions.\"",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker confirmed that memo and said he had also been told an additional 400 other National Guard members from Texas would be deployed to Chicago and Portland, Oregon.",

      "The FBI analyzed the phone records of more than a half dozen Republican lawmakers as part of an investigation into efforts by President Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to information released Monday by GOP senators.",
      "The records, which the FBI analyzed in 2023, enabled investigators to see basic information about the date and time of phone calls but not the content of the communications, the senators said. The data encompassed several days during the week of Jan. 6, 2021, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to halt the certification of the election results.",
      "A document dated Sept. 27, 2023, lists nine Republican lawmakers whose records were allegedly scrutinized: Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.",
      "The disclosure adds new detail to the since-shuttered investigation by the FBI and former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith into the steps Mr. Trump took in the run-up to the Capitol riot to undo his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Mr. Trump was indicted in August 2023 with conspiring to overturn the results, but the case was abandoned after Mr. Trump's win the following year because of a Justice Department legal opinion that states sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.",
      "The subpoena for the phone records was disclosed by several Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee that oversees the FBI. Grassley said the Sept. 27, 2023, document memorializing the \"preliminary toll analysis\" was found in response to his request. The investigative step was authorized by a grand jury, the senators said.",
      "Grassley called it a \"violation of personal property and people's rights and the law and their constitutional rights.\"",

After the voting was disrupted by the rioters on Jan. 6, 2021, most of the lawmakers named in the FBI document voted to certify the results, while Sen. Lummis and Rep. Kelly objected to at least one state.",
      "The special counsel's investigation delved into phone calls between lawmakers and the president on the evening of Jan. 6, 2021, which Smith alleged were part of a last-ditch attempt to talk congressional Republicans into blocking the certification of Biden's victory. The 2023 indictment against Mr. Trump lists several attempts by Mr. Trump and his alleged co-conspirators to reach senators and representatives by phone. It argued the president \"attempted to exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol by calling lawmakers to convince them, based on knowingly false claims of election fraud, to delay the certification.\"",
      "Last year, a final report penned by Smith \u2014 which argued the president would have been convicted if not for his 2024 election win \u2014 also pointed to phone calls placed by Mr. Trump and members of his circle. It cited toll records from two unindicted co-conspirators who are unnamed\u00a0but are widely believed to be Rudy Giuliani and one other person.",
      "The senators said they would not be conducting their own investigation because they expected FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino \u2014 both Trump loyalists \u2014 to review the matter.

      "A federal judge late Sunday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon, after a legal whirlwind that began hours earlier when the president mobilized California troops for Portland after the same judge blocked him from using Oregon's National Guard the day before.",
      "During a hastily called telephone hearing, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut granted a temporary restraining order sought by California and Oregon.",
      "A day earlier, the same judge temporarily blocked\u00a0the administration from deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland. But on Sunday, the president moved to send National Guard troops to the state from neighboring California and then from Texas.",
      "Immergut, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, issued her second, more sweeping order late Sunday after she upbraided the federal government's attorney and questioned how the move to send the California and Texas troops to Oregon was not \"in direct contravention of the order that was issued yesterday.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "Small protests have been going on nightly outside Portland's immigration processing facility since Mr. Trump's second term began in January. There have been occasional flare-ups, including in June, but for weeks the demonstrations attracted only a few dozen people \u2014 until the Trump administration mobilized the Oregon National Guard\u00a0on Sept. 28 against Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek's wishes.",
      "A small number of demonstrators gathered Sunday evening cheered when they learned about the judge's order.",
      "Immergut issued Saturday's order pending further arguments in a lawsuit brought by the state and city. She said the relatively small protests didn't justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.",
      "Her Saturday ruling came after Mr. Trump called the city \"war-ravaged.\" Oregon officials and Portland residents alike said that description was ludicrous.",
      "A Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement that about 200 federalized members of the California National Guard who had been on duty around Los Angeles were being reassigned to Portland. Kotek said about 100 arrived Saturday and around 100 more were en route Sunday.",
      "The two states originally requested a narrower order that would have blocked only California National Guard troops from being sent to Oregon, but asked for the order to apply to all National Guard troops after a memo written by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was submitted to the court that said up to 400 Texas National Guard personnel were being activated for deployment to Oregon, Illinois and possibly elsewhere.",
      "Immergut grilled lawyers for the federal government, accusing them of seeking an end run around her Saturday order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Oregon.",
      "\"How could bringing in federalized National Guard from California not be in direct contravention of the TRO I issued yesterday?\" she said Sunday.",
      "Immergut told one federal government attorney that he was \"missing the point\" because conditions on the ground in Oregon hadn't changed and she saw no legal basis and need for the military to assist local law enforcement.",
      "Lawyers for the federal government tried to argue that Oregon and Portland didn't have standing and that California could show no harm by having some of its National Guard dispatched to another state.",
      "Scott Kennedy, the attorney representing Oregon, said he learned of the Texas National Guard mobilization just 24 minutes before the emergency hearing on Sunday night. \"It feels a little bit like we're playing a game of rhetorical whack-a-mole here,\" he told Immergut.",

      "Kotek said the latest move by federal officials is an attempt to circumvent Saturday's court ruling that blocked deployment of Oregon's guard members.",

      "Despite the proposed cuts, NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, said last month as he introduced a new class of 10 NASA astronaut candidates that there's a possibility one of them could be among the first Americans to put their boots on Mars. However, flights are not yet on the drawing board, and most experts say no such NASA mission is likely to launch within the next decade, and probably longer.",
      "Duffy also said he was confident the U.S. would beat China and win the second space race back to the moon.",
      "Referring to the recent news of Mars rover Perseverance uncovering\u00a0rocks that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, Nye said a NASA budget cut would put the U.S. behind as China plans to launch its sample-return mission in 2028, possibly bringing back samples in 2033.",

Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",

They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",

      "The moon will appear slightly larger and brighter Monday night during what's known as a supermoon.",
      "October's supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\"It's not really very unusual,\" said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
      "Everyone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment, if the skies are clear. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven't observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.",
      "\"If you go out and just look at the moon when it's very high in the sky, there is nothing relative to it to give you an idea of how big it looks,\" Pitts said.",
      "In the latest viewing, the moon will pass within about 224,600 miles of Earth. The closest supermoon of the year is slated for November, followed by another in December.",
      "The spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.",
      "Why does the moon appear bigger and brighter during a supermoon?",
      "Like Earth's orbit around the Sun, the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, or oval-shaped. This means it's positioned at different distances from the planet depending on the time of the month. The distances range from about 226,000 miles and 251,000 miles, according to NASA.",
      "When the moon is hovering around one of those closer distances along its path in orbit, and there's also a full moon, it becomes a supermoon. The proximity to Earth can make the moon appear bigger to skywatchers on the ground. Sunlight reflecting off the moon can also appear brighter, NASA says.",
      "Supermoons only happen three or four times a year, since the moon's closeness to Earth rarely coincides with monthly full moons. They aren't identical, either. Astronomers generally consider a full moon to be \"super\" if the moon's position in orbit is at least 90% of the distance from its farthest point to Earth in the ellipse to its closest.

      "These strange objects intrigue astronomers because they are \"neither a star nor a proper planet,\" Alexander Scholz, an astronomer at Scotland's University of St. Andrews and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",

      "\"This is the strongest accretion episode ever recorded for a planetary-mass object,\" said Almendros-Abad.",
      "\"Awe-inspiring\"",
      "By comparing light emitted before and during this binge-eating session, the scientists discovered that magnetic activity was playing a role in driving matter towards the object.",
      "This phenomenon has previously only been observed in stars.",
      "The chemistry in the disc also changed. Water vapour was detected in the disc during the accretion episode, but not beforehand.",
      "This is also something that has previously been observed in stars \u2014 but never for a forming planet.",
      "Lead study author Ray Jayawardhana of Johns Hopkins University said the discovery implies \"that some objects comparable to giant planets form the way stars do, from contracting clouds of gas and dust accompanied by discs of their own, and they go through growth episodes just like newborn stars.\"",
      "No matter how weird, Cha 1107-7626 is still expected to have similar characteristics to huge planets, because it is of similar size.",
      "Scholz said that, unlike stars, this object is \"not massive enough to ever have fusion reactions in the core.\"",

      "For a long time, scientists believed Enceladus was too far away from the sun \u2014 and therefore too cold \u2014 to be habitable.",
      "Then the Cassini space probe flew past the moon several times during a 2004-2017 trip to Saturn and its rings, discovering evidence that a vast saltwater ocean is concealed under the moon's miles-thick layer of ice.",
      "Since then, scientists have been sifting through the data collected by Cassini, revealing that the ocean has many of the elements thought to be needed to host life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide and phosphorus.",
      "When the spacecraft passed over the moon's south pole, it discovered jets of water bursting through cracks on the surface.",
      "These jets were propelling tiny ice particles \u2014 smaller than grains of sand \u2014 into space. While some of these ice grains fell back to the moon's surface, others collected around one of Saturn's many rings.",
      "When Cassini flew through Saturn's outermost \"E\" ring, it was \"detecting samples from Enceladus all the time,\" Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin and lead author of the new study, said in a statement from the European Space agency.",
      "\"There are many possible pathways from the organic molecules we found in the Cassini data to potentially biologically relevant compounds, which enhances the likelihood that the moon is habitable,\" Nozair said.",
      "By looking through these samples, scientists had previously identified numerous organic molecules \u2014 including the precursors of amino acids, which are fundamental building blocks of life.",
      "But these ice grains could have been altered after being trapped in the ring for hundreds of years \u2014 or beaten up by blasts of cosmic radiation.",
      "So the scientists wanted to look at some fresh ice grains.",
      "Luckily, they already had access to some.",
      "When Cassini flew directly into the spray spewing from the moon's surface in 2008, grains of ice hit the spacecraft's Cosmic Dust Analyzer at around 11 miles a second.",
      "But it took years to complete a detailed chemical analysis of these particles, which was the subject of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\"Being habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Having a variety of organic compounds on an extraterrestrial water world is simply phenomenal,\" Klenner told the AP in an email.",
      "\"Another piece of the puzzle\"",
      "Study co-author Frank Postberg said the research proves that \"the complex organic molecules Cassini detected in Saturn's E ring are not just a product of long exposure to space, but are readily available in Enceladus's ocean.\"",
      "French astrochemist Caroline Freissinet, who was not involved in the study, told AFP that there was \"not much doubt\" that these molecules were in the moon's ocean.",
      "But this confirmation provides \"another piece in the puzzle,\" she added.",
      "It also shows that recent technology such as artificial intelligence allows scientists to perform new kinds of analysis on old data, she said.",
      "But to get the best idea about what is happening on Enceladus, a mission would need to land near the icy geysers and collect samples, she added.",
      "The European Space Agency has been studying the potential of a mission that would do just that.",
      "After all, \"Enceladus ticks all the boxes to be a habitable environment that could support life,\" the agency said in the statement.",
      "Khawaja added that \"even not finding life on Enceladus would be a huge discovery, because it raises serious questions about why life is not present in such an environment when the right conditions are there.\"",
      "NASA has a spacecraft en route to another enticing target to hunt for the ingredients of life: Jupiter's moon Europa. The Europa Clipper is expected to begin orbiting Jupiter in 2030 with dozens of Europa flybys. ESA also has a spacecraft, Juice, that's headed to Jupiter to explore Europa and two other icy moons that could hold buried oceans.",
      "Underground oceans on moons \"are perhaps the best candidates for the emergence of extraterrestrial life in our solar system. This work only confirms the need for further studies,\" University of Kent physics professor Nigel Mason, who was not involved in the latest findings, told the AP.",

      "Bill Nye and hundreds of others gathered at Capitol Hill on Monday to protest against the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to NASA, arguing that Congress has an obligation to promote the progress of science.",
      "\"The United States would cede leadership to other countries, especially [the] China National Space Administration,\" if funding to NASA Science is cut, Nye said. In an interview on \"The Takeout\" following the protest, Nye argued NASA's budget is just \"a sliver of the pie\" of the nearly $1.7 trillion federal budget.",
      "\"It's barely the width of the pie cutter, it's less than 0.1% of the federal budget and the return is extraordinary,\" he told CBS News' Major Garrett.",
      "A White House budget proposal\u00a0issued\u00a0earlier this year would see NASA's funding cut by about 25% for fiscal year 2026, from about $24 billion to $18.8 billion.",
      "Nye, the CEO of Planetary Society and former host of \"Bill Nye the Science Guy,\" and around 300 space advocates said Monday\u00a0that dozens of missions would be at risk \u2014 including NASA's Perseverance Mars rover and the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time in half a century \u2014 if the cuts are approved by Congress.",
      "Despite the proposed cuts, NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, said last month as he introduced a new class of 10 NASA astronaut candidates that there's a possibility one of them could be among the first Americans to put their boots on Mars. However, flights are not yet on the drawing board, and most experts say no such NASA mission is likely to launch within the next decade, and probably longer.",
      "Duffy also said he was confident the U.S. would beat China and win the second space race back to the moon.",
      "Referring to the recent news of Mars rover Perseverance uncovering\u00a0rocks that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, Nye said a NASA budget cut would put the U.S. behind as China plans to launch its sample-return mission in 2028, possibly bringing back samples in 2033.",
      "\"Everybody, understand that if we were to find evidence of life on another world, it would change the course of human history,\" he added. \"So you say, 'Well, how much does that cost?' We're not sure. We've never done it.\"",
      "The 69-year-old science advocate said investing in NASA is \"priceless,\" telling Garrett: \"NASA also, objectively, every dollar that goes into NASA Science comes back at least a factor of three times, so if you put $1 into NASA Science, you're going to get $3 back into the economy.\"",

    "story": [
      "The moon will appear slightly larger and brighter Monday night during what's known as a supermoon.",
      "October's supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\"It's not really very unusual,\" said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
      "Everyone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment, if the skies are clear. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven't observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.",
      "\"If you go out and just look at the moon when it's very high in the sky, there is nothing relative to it to give you an idea of how big it looks,\" Pitts said.",
      "In the latest viewing, the moon will pass within about 224,600 miles of Earth. The closest supermoon of the year is slated for November, followed by another in December.",
      "The spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.",
      "Why does the moon appear bigger and brighter during a supermoon?",
      "Like Earth's orbit around the Sun, the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, or oval-shaped. This means it's positioned at different distances from the planet depending on the time of the month. The distances range from about 226,000 miles and 251,000 miles, according to NASA.",
      "When the moon is hovering around one of those closer distances along its path in orbit, and there's also a full moon, it becomes a supermoon. The proximity to Earth can make the moon appear bigger to skywatchers on the ground. Sunlight reflecting off the moon can also appear brighter, NASA says.",
      "Supermoons only happen three or four times a year, since the moon's closeness to Earth rarely coincides with monthly full moons. They aren't identical, either. Astronomers generally consider a full moon to be \"super\" if the moon's position in orbit is at least 90% of the distance from its farthest point to Earth in the ellipse to its closest. The absolute closest point\u00a0is called the perigee.",

      "A mysterious \"rogue planet\"\u00a0has been observed gobbling 6 billion tons of gas and dust a second \u2014 an unprecedented rate that blurs the line between planets and stars, astronomers said Thursday.",
      "Unlike Earth and other planets in our solar system, which orbit the sun, rogue planets float freely through the universe untethered to a star.",
      "Scientists estimate there could be trillions of rogue planets in our galaxy alone \u2014 but they are difficult to spot because they mostly drift quietly along in perpetual night.",
      "\"People may think of planets as quiet and stable worlds, but with this discovery we see that planetary-mass objects freely floating in space can be exciting places,\" V\u00edctor Almendros-Abad, a lead author of the new study, said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "These strange objects intrigue astronomers because they are \"neither a star nor a proper planet,\" Alexander Scholz, an astronomer at Scotland's University of St. Andrews and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "\"Their origin remains an open question: are they the lowest-mass objects formed like stars, or giant planets ejected from their birth systems?\"",
      "Rogue planet found growing at record rate: six billion tonnes a second!\n\nUnlike the planets in our Solar System, rogue...",
      "The team of researchers behind the new study was stunned to observe an astonishing growth spurt in a rogue planet around 620 light years from Earth in the constellation Chamaeleon.",
      "The planet, officially called Cha 1107-7626, has a mass five to 10 times bigger than Jupiter.",
      "Scholz explained that the object is \"still in its infancy,\" being roughly 1 or 2 million years old.",
      "The object grows by sucking in matter from a disc that surrounds it \u2014 a process called accretion.",
      "But what the astronomers saw happen to Cha 1107-7626 \"blurs the line between stars and planets,\" study co-author Belinda Damian said in a statement.",
      "In August this year, the planet suddenly started devouring matter from its disc at a record-breaking 6 billion tons per second \u2014 eight times faster than a few months earlier.",
      "\"This is the strongest accretion episode ever recorded for a planetary-mass object,\" said Almendros-Abad.",
      "\"Awe-inspiring\"",
      "By comparing light emitted before and during this binge-eating session, the scientists discovered that magnetic activity was playing a role in driving matter towards the object.",
      "This phenomenon has previously only been observed in stars.",
      "The chemistry in the disc also changed. Water vapour was detected in the disc during the accretion episode, but not beforehand.",
      "This is also something that has previously been observed in stars \u2014 but never for a forming planet.",
      "Lead study author Ray Jayawardhana of Johns Hopkins University said the discovery implies \"that some objects comparable to giant planets form the way stars do, from contracting clouds of gas and dust accompanied by discs of their own, and they go through growth episodes just like newborn stars.\"",
      "No matter how weird, Cha 1107-7626 is still expected to have similar characteristics to huge planets, because it is of similar size.",
      "Scholz said that, unlike stars, this object is \"not massive enough to ever have fusion reactions in the core.\"",
      "So, like other planets, \"it will cool inevitably as it gets older,\" he added.",
      "Amelia Bayo, another co-author of the study in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said, \"The idea that a planetary object can behave like a star is awe-inspiring.\"",
      "It \"invites us to wonder what worlds beyond our own could be like during their nascent stages,\" she added.",

      "\"I've flown safety chase on it for several missions, messaging back and forth with the autonomy on board,\" said McMullen.",
      "Maneuvering alongside an AI-piloted drone, he said, takes a bit of getting used to: \"As humans, we fly very smooth, but it can roll and fly a little bit snappier than maybe a human pilot would,\" McMullen acknowledged. \"It could be a little bit rougher a ride, but there's no human on board.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is on board, and now it is learning how to fight.",
      "McMullen said the tasks assigned to AI might be to intercept an adversary aircraft: \"So, we've been able to give it some of the basic blocking and tackling of air combat that we as human pilots also train on when we're first learning how to fly,\" he said.",
      "The XQ-58 blasts off like a rocket, but a full-scale model took off from a runway for the first time in August.",
      "General Adrian Spain, head of Air Combat Command, is drawing up plans for operating AI-piloted drones alongside manned aircraft. \"You've told them to go out in front and to execute an attack on a complex set of targets, and they will do that,\" Spain said.",

      "An AI-piloted F-16 has already held its own in a limited dogfight against an experienced fighter pilot. At Top Gun AI, other F-16s are being rewired for more realistic combat.

      "\"So, once the AI goes on, the hands come off?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yep, they'll be monitoring the system and ready to take over at a moment's notice,\" McMullen said. \"But we'll also have real live aircraft out there for it to fight against. Those jets will be piloted by real fighter pilots trying their best to outsmart the AI.\"",
      "So, are we witnessing a revolution?",
      "\"If we continue down this path, it has the potential to be a revolution,\" said Spain.",
      "\"You actually can take more risk\"",
      "Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Clint Hinote says it is a revolution born of necessity: \"The Air Force was so good for so long that it didn't need to change. Now it needs to change, and it's trying to figure out how.\"",
      "Change because the Chinese air force, which recently \u00a0showcased its newest jet fighters and its own AI drone, could be more than a match for the U.S. Air Force. According to Hinote, \"If we have to fight China, we're likely doing it in their front yard, and that means they can bring many, many more things to bear than we can, because it's so far away. You're having to achieve kill ratios of 10 to 1, 15 to 1, and 20 to 1 to even stay in the game.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do these war games come out when American pilots are going up against 20 to 1 odds?\"",
      "\"The war games don't turn out very well,\" Hinote replied. \"We lose.\"",
      "The Air Force is counting on AI drones to even the odds, by bringing to an aircraft what a human pilot doesn't. McMullen said, \"The big thing with artificial intelligence is the ability to handle large amounts of data. A human out in a complex air combat environment, there's just no way to absorb all of it. Artificial intelligence might be able to take all of the data information, and then process that very quickly, and then make real-time decisions.\"",
      "AI drones will be about half the length of a manned jet fighter, and one-quarter the cost \u2013 $20 to 30 million each. Hinote said, \"You could buy more airplanes, put them in the field, and still not break the bank. The key would be that you don't have to bring the human operator home; you actually can take more risk.\"",
      "Spain says the Air Force expects to have 150 AI-piloted aircraft by the end of the decade, and eventually up to 1,000.",
      "I asked, \"These drones aren't just going to sit in a hangar waiting for war with China. What are they going to do in peacetime?\"",
      "\"It's pretty wide open,\" Spain replied.",
      "\"Could you send up AI drones to intercept those Russian bombers that come down off the coast of Alaska?\"",
      "\"Yes, you could do that,\" he said.",
      "Those intercepts can turn nasty in an instant. Last year a Russian fighter rocked an American F-16, so AI drones would have to be prepared to shoot.",
      "So, is AI going to be making life-or-death decisions? \"Absolutely not,\" said Spain. \"Absolutely not. The human who's controlling the AI will make the life-and-death decisions.\"",
      "At least for now.",
      "Making life-or-death decisions",
      "Hinote said, \"Increasingly militaries around the world, including the United States military, are going to be pressured to give the machines more leeway in making those life-or-death decisions.\"",
      "Including the capability to fire on their own? \"The United States military is investing in the experimentation that you would need to be able to produce the types of platforms that could fire on their own if you gave them that option,\" Hinote said.",
      "If adversaries let AI make those decisions, what happens? \"I think they do so at their own peril,\" said Spain. \"Because the AI can be fooled, the AI can be overwhelmed. It can give you false outcomes. We've seen that AI can hallucinate. So, it's not a guarantee of success. What it guarantees is that it will do something quickly.\"",
      "\"Don't you at least have to give your pilots that option?\" I asked.",
      "\"To go full autonomy and just let it go? I don't think America is comfortable with that yet,\" Spain replied. \"I'm not saying that couldn't be a future world that we live in where we trust it. But I don't think we're there right now, certainly, and certainly not to start. We have to build that trust over time.\"",
      "At Top Gun AI, pilots keep putting in the reps, test flight after test flight, simulation after simulation, to build that trust.",
      "Asked whether he would rather go into combat with a human wingman or an AI wingman, McMullen replied, \"When we're talking about the threats of tomorrow, if I can send an uncrewed asset into a high-risk environment, I'd rather do that than send a human pilot.\"",

      "Tropical Storm Jerry formed Tuesday over tropical waters in the central Atlantic Ocean, the National Hurricane Center said. It is the 10th named storm of the 2025 hurricane season.",
      "The newly developed system was far from land when the hurricane center issued its first advisory for Jerry. Forecasters said the storm was more than 1,030 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands, the Caribbean chain east of Puerto Rico that starts with the Virgin Islands and extends down to Guadeloupe.",
      "Jerry had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as it tracked west-northwest at 23 mph across the open ocean as of Tuesday night, according to forecasters. It was expected to steadily strengthen and eventually grow into a hurricane in a day or so, the hurricane center said in its 11 p.m. ET update.",
      "A tropical storm watch was in effect for the Caribbean islands of Barbuda, Anguilla, St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat, St. Barthelemy, Saint Martin, Sint Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Guadeloupe and the adjacent islands.",
      "On its forecast track, Jerry is expected to be near or north of the northern Leewards by late Thursday or Friday, the hurricane center said. Although the storm isn't currently expected to make landfall, the swells it generates will likely reach the islands on Thursday, causing life-threatening surf and rip currents, according to the latest advisory.",
      "It is forecast to bring up to 4 inches of rain to the Leeward Islands, the hurricane center said, including the risk of flash flooding.",
      "Jerry developed on the heels of several Atlantic storm systems, including Hurricane Humberto and Hurricane Imelda, which emerged at the end of September. Concerns that both could strike Bermuda briefly circulated, but only Imelda ultimately brushed the coast of the island as a Category 2 hurricane, before quickly weakening on its way out to the open ocean.",
      "Humberto and Imelda also threatened the southeastern United States with destructive surf, causing multiple coastal homes in North Carolina's Outer Banks to collapse.",
      "This has been a relatively quiet hurricane season, which typically runs annually from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. While Jerry is the 10th named storm this year, just one of the nine others \u2014 Chantal \u2014 actually made landfall in the U.S.",
      "When the current season began, an outlook released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicated that between 13 and 19 named storms would form in the Atlantic, with up to nine becoming hurricanes and as many as five strengthening into powerful Category 5 storms. But, as the months progressed, NOAA revised its outlook in August to predict that 13 to 18 named storms would form, including five to nine hurricanes.",

    "story": [
      "Matt Van Epps is projected to win a crowded Republican primary Tuesday in the special election to replace a former Tennessee GOP congressman, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Van Epps will face off in December against Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn, who is projected to win a four-way primary for the Democratic nomination.",
      "Van Epps clinched the GOP victory following an endorsement from President Trump that came after in-person early voting ended. Eleven Republicans were on the ballot for the seat vacated by former Rep. Mark Green, who resigned over the summer due to \"an opportunity in the private sector that was too exciting to pass up.\" Among them, two candidates suspended their campaigns after Mr. Trump weighed in and joined the president in endorsing Van Epps.",
      "\"Thank you to the people of Middle and West Tennessee! Our Donald J. Trump-endorsed campaign won in a landslide tonight,\" Van Epps said on social media. \"Now, on to December 2nd! We're going to win the general and keep this seat RED!\"",
      "If Republicans hold onto the seat, it would slightly expand their margin in the U.S. House, where the GOP holds a single-digit majority. The general election in December could also gauge the popularity of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, especially with Republican-leaning suburban voters in the Nashville area.",
      "The 7th Congressional District spans 14 counties, bordering both Kentucky and Alabama. Along with parts of Nashville, it includes rural areas, wealthy suburbs and part of a military installation, Fort Campbell. The seat is one of three districts that GOP lawmakers drew as safely red in 2022 by dividing left-leaning Nashville. Its voters elected Green by 21 percentage points in 2024 and by nearly 22 points in 2022.",
      "Of its nine seats in the House, Tennessee currently has one Democrat, Rep. Steve Cohen of Memphis. Republican redistricting in 2022 allowed the GOP to flip another Democratic seat that was drawn to include only part of Nashville.",
      "Van Epps previously served in several roles under Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee. During the primary campaign, Van Epps leaned into his military experience, including as a Tennessee Army National Guard lieutenant colonel and as an Army Special Operations helicopter pilot. Among the competitors he defeated were state Reps. Jody Barrett and Gino Bulso.",
      "Behn is a social worker and community organizer who has focused on women's reproductive health rights, including as a plaintiff in a lawsuit against a Tennessee law banning adults from helping minors get an abortion without parental permission. A judge has halted the provision's enforcement.",
      "Mr. Trump endorsed Van Epps in a Truth Social post late last week that praised him as an \"America First Patriot.\"",
      "\"A West Point Graduate, and Combat Decorated Army Helicopter Pilot, Matt knows the WISDOM and COURAGE required to Defend our Country, Support our Incredible Military/Veterans, and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The nod from Mr. Trump followed Van Epps' prior endorsements from Lee, Green and Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.",
      "Outside groups spent more than $3.1 million on the race, almost all on the GOP side, with about $1.1 million opposing Barrett.",
      "The Republican primary contenders praised Mr. Trump and expressed staunch opposition to anything perceived as liberal or \"woke.\" Meanwhile, in the Democratic primary, the four candidates attacked the legislation Mr. Trump dubbed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" in addition to his tariffs.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Oct 2025 20:14:23 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard a challenge to a Colorado law banning \"conversion therapy\" for minors that was brought by a licensed counselor in the state.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday grappled with a\u00a0Colorado counselor's challenge to the state's ban on \"conversion therapy\" for minors.",
      "The case was brought by Kaley Chiles, who argued the state's restriction unconstitutionally censors conversations about gender dysphoria and sexual orientation that she seeks to have with young patients. Chiles, who is Christian, said she wants to engage in talk therapy with minor clients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body.\"",
      "But she said she fears that having those conversations with young patients puts her at risk of violating Colorado's law. Lower courts ruled against Chiles, finding Colorado's law regulates professional conduct.",
      "An issue at the center of the dispute, known as Chiles v. Salazar, is whether Colorado's ban regulates Chiles' professional conduct or her speech. Shannon Stevenson, Colorado's solicitor general, told the justices its law only regulates medical treatments and practices provided by a counselors licensed by the state. Jim Campbell, who argued on behalf of Chiles, told the court that the law seeks to transform therapists into \"mouthpieces for the government.\"",
      "Colorado's conversion therapy ban",
      "Called the Minor Conversion Therapy Law, Colorado's ban was enacted in 2019 and prohibits mental health professionals from engaging in any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\"",
      "Violators face fines of up to $5,000 and risk being suspended from practicing or stripped of their license. Colorado is one of more than 20 states that have enacted bans on \"conversion therapy.\"",
      "Several years after Colorado's law took effect, Chiles sued state licensing officials, arguing that the ban violates her free speech rights by censoring her conversations with patients based on viewpoint and the content of those discussions.",
      "Colorado has not taken any disciplinary action against Chiles or any other licensed therapist for violating the ban, it said in court papers, and the state asserts that the talk therapy Chiles' aims to provide wouldn't defy its law because she expressly doesn't seek to change a patient's gender identity or sexual orientation.",
      "\"The only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor's sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\" they wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.",
      "But Campbell told the court that anonymous complaints have been filed against Chiles in recent weeks that the state is now investigating. He argued that there remains a \"credible threat of enforcement\" against her.",
      "At least two of the justices appeared skeptical of Colorado's interpretation of the law and its claim that Chiles would not be violating it with the types of discussions she wants to have with patients. Justice Neil Gorsuch called the state's reading of the law \"peculiar,\" while Justice Samuel Alito questioned how Stevenson \"can square your interpretation\" of the law with its plain meaning.",
      "Campbell argued that Colorado's ban forbids licensed counselors from helping minors pursue \"state disfavored goals\" on issues of gender and sexuality. The law prevents families and teens who want to address gender dysphoria by aligning identity and sex from working with a licensed counselor to help reach that goal. But practices that provide assistance to patients undergoing gender transition are allowed under the law, he said.",
      "The law \"undermines the well-being\" of children struggling with gender dysphoria by restricting their access to certain kinds of talk therapy, Campbell said, and he argued Chiles is being \"silenced\" every day that Colorado's ban can be enforced against her.",
      "\"The Free Speech Clause forbids the State from censoring mutual conversations on important topics. This includes discussions between counselors and clients on deeply personal issues,\" lawyers with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal advocacy group that is representing Chiles, wrote in filings. \"Colorado's viewpoint-based intrusion into the counseling room is unconstitutional.\"",
      "Campbell argued that the high court \"has recognized many times\" that one-on-one conversation, which is Chiles' method of treatment, is a form of speech.",
      "\"She's encouraging them to achieve their goals,\" he said of Chiles' discussions with clients, adding that \"this is an ongoing active dialogue\" that \"absolutely has to be protected\" by the First Amendment.",
      "But state officials said there is a long history of states regulating the health care profession to protect patients from harmful practices, and the First Amendment has never barred states from doing that. Colorado pointed to medical malpractice laws and other licensing regimes, which lawyers said have long covered mental health and other treatments performed with words.",
      "Stevenson, who argued on behalf of Colorado, said its law is a \"reasonable regulation\" of professional conduct. She told the justices that therapists have a fiduciary duty to protect their clients from substandard care.",
      "Additionally, they have argued conversion therapy is ineffective and associated with depression, anxiety, loss of faith and suicidality, regardless of how it is performed. Major medical associations have warned that efforts to change a patient's sexual orientation or gender identity are potentially harmful to young people and not supported by credible scientific evidence.",
      "Colorado officials also refuted Chiles' claim that the state is trying to tamp down on certain speech \u2014 discouraging gender transition \u2014 that it disfavors.",
      "\"At no time has the First Amendment been understood to confer on professionals a constitutional right to use words to deliver treatment that violates the standard of care,\" they argued.",
      "During the arguments, Alito asked Stevenson if a post-adolescent male is attracted to other males and wants a therapist's help in ending or lessening that attraction, would that be banned under Colorado's statute?",
      "Stevenson said it turns on whether the purpose of the treatment is to change the individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. If the patient wanted a counselor's help to become straight, that would be banned, she acknowledged, but if the patient were being advised on how to cope with his sexuality, that would be allowed.",
      "She argued that there are harms that result from conversion therapy, which posits that \"you can change this innate thing about yourself.\"",
      "Both Alito and Justice Elena Kagan raised the possibility that applying the statute could result in viewpoint discrimination. Kagan said that if we're in \"normal free speech-land \u2026 rather than in this kind of doctor-land,\" if the male in Alito's example identifies as gay and is told by a therapist that he'll be helped to accept that, that is acceptable. But if the male is told we're \"going to help you change,\" that is not.",
      "\"One of those is permissible and the other is not, that seems like viewpoint discrimination in the way we would normally understand viewpoint discrimination,\" she said.",
      "Stevenson said she agreed, but said it underscored why medical treatment has to be treated differently.",
      "Colorado lawyers and those backing the state have also warned that if Chiles' prevails, it would destabilize longstanding health care regulation and gut states' power to ensure mental health professionals adhere to the standard of care.",
      "The Trump administration is backing Chiles in the case, but told the Supreme Court in a filing that it should send the case back to lower courts to take another look at the law.",
      "\"Colorado is muzzling one side of an ongoing debate in the mental-health community about how to discuss questions of gender and sexuality with children,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing. \"Under the First Amendment, the State bears a heavy burden to justify that content-based restriction on protected speech.\"",
      "A few justices, including Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson, raised the idea of sending the case back to the lower courts to review the Colorado law under strict scrutiny, the most demanding level of judicial review. Why wouldn't we do that? Jackson asked Campbell.",
      "He responded that Chiles continues to suffer irreparable harm and \"is being silenced\" because of concerns she could violate Colorado's ban, while children who need help are \"being left without support.\"",

      "As of Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. EDT, more than 600 flights within the U.S. had been delayed, FlightAware data shows.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing the nation's air traffic controllers, on Monday instructed its members to keep working\u00a0during the\u00a0government shutdown. Because air traffic controllers are classified as essential workers, they're expected to continue working without pay, although they would receive back pay once the shutdown ends.",
      "\"It is normal for a few air traffic controllers to call in sick on any given day, and this is the latest example of how fragile our aviation system is in the midst of a national shortage of these critical safety professionals,\" NATCA said in statement.",
      "It added, \"NATCA has consistently warned that the controller staffing shortage leaves the system vulnerable, and today's events underscore the urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.\"",
      "The TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick\u00a0since the shutdown began last week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.",
      "\"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes,\" he told reporters. \"You'll see delays come from that. ...

    "story": [
      "Wealth has long been tied to longevity in the U.S. and other countries, but a new analysis helps quantify the gap between how long low-income older Americans and their more affluent peers tend to live.",
      "Low-income people over 60 years old die an average of nine years earlier than high-income older Americans, according to the new study from the National Council on Aging\ufeff\u00a0(NCOA) and University of Massachusetts Boston's LeadingAge LTSS Center, which studies aging.",
      "Generally, middle-income older Americans are also dying younger than wealthier people, the researchers founds. About 15% of seniors with annual household incomes of roughly $60,000 died during the four-year study period, compared with about 11% in households with incomes of around $120,000.",
      "\"This is the first time we've tied health and wealth together \u2014 this was really shocking for me,\" said Jessica Johnston, senior director of the NCOA's Center for Economic Well-Being, of the nine-year life gap. \"We all traditionally and culturally were taught to value our elders, and if we played by the rules we could age well, and I think that's changing.\"",
      "The study is based on an analysis of data from 2018 to 2022 gathered through the University of Michigan's Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal panel study that tracks 10,000 households. NCOA, a nonprofit group based in Arlington, Virginia, advocates for older adults.",
      "The findings have implications for an aging society that has seen widening economic inequality, with the income gap between the richest and poorest households growing wider in recent decades, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., as well as\u00a0to other researchers.",
      "As the U.S. population ages, the divide between rich and poor is also reflected in the experiences of senior citizens, with many reaching retirement age without the financial resources to handle shocks like a health emergency or the loss of a spouse, the NCOA study found.",
      "The difference in average mortality age by income could be due to a lack of preventative care for low-income seniors, an inability to pay for care as they age or the stress of financial instability, Johnston said.",
      "The poverty rate among U.S. seniors rose to 15% last year from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to Census data.",
      "\"Older adults are placed into situations where they are going to have to make really difficult decisions: Am I going to go to the grocery store, am I going to pay rent or am I going to get my medication?\" Johnston told CBS News. \"It's not only about forgoing one of those things, but it's the added stress about those decisions.\"",
      "About 80% of people over 60 have few, or even zero, financial assets and would struggle to cope with a financial shock like the loss of a spouse or needing long-term care, according to the report. Most of those Americans will face financial insecurity in their later years, the researchers said.",
      "\"If older adults can't afford long-term care or can't afford medicine, family members are often picking up that cost,\" Johnston said. \"The lost economic productivity among Gen Xers and millennials will play out over the next one to two decades.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:35:00 -0400",
    "summary": "DNI Tulsi Gabbard issued a directive to review polygraph policies and curb press leaks, echoing actions taken by the Bush and Obama administrations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard in the last month issued a memo ordering U.S. intelligence agencies to conduct a review of whether random polygraph examinations of their employees or contractors are feasible.",
      "At the same time, the directive emphasizes the need for tests to include questions about whether employees or potential applicants have leaked information to members of the press as part of the standard battery of questions during the security clearance adjudication process, CBS News has learned.",
      "While questions related to leaks have been commonplace for U.S. intelligence community employees and applicants, the Trump administration is intensifying efforts to curb disclosures of classified and sensitive information by warning intelligence community members they'll face additional scrutiny over leaks to media outlets. In many ways, Gabbard's directive echoes earlier hard-line stances undertaken by previous administrations of both political parties to root out sources of revelations that were either potentially damaging to national security or politically embarrassing.",
      "Two sources familiar with Gabbard's memo said that the directive emphasizes polygraph test questions related to leaks of information to the press and said the tests would become more routine in conjunction with counterintelligence investigations. The officials, who spoke to CBS News under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that while the U.S. government has a responsibility to safeguard its information, the mandate could stem the flow of information the public has the right to know, even if it's unclassified.",
      "An official with the Office of Director of National Intelligence, known as ODNI, told CBS News that while the directive does reinforce questions related to leaks to members of the press, Gabbard's memo does not establish new policies, but instead emphasizes existing regulations and legal statutes. The directive also does not direct agencies to begin random polygraph examinations but instead asks agencies within the U.S. intelligence community to review the feasibility of conducting random polygraphs in conjunction with counterintelligence investigations.",
      "The official said the review is based on internal U.S. intelligence community findings that indicated a lack of polygraph examinations has emboldened former U.S. intelligence community members to spy on behalf of U.S. adversaries. The ODNI official was unable to provide further details on the study or when it was conducted. The official emphasized that Gabbard's directive does not order additional screenings.",
      "Her directive is emblematic of a return to the aggressive approach taken under the Obama administration following the massive disclosure of classified information to journalists by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. In 2014, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper instructed federal agencies to question applicants and employees about whether they had shared classified material with the news media, according to the McClatchy news service, which obtained Clapper's policy directive under a Freedom of Information Act request.",
      "Both the Obama and Bush administrations were heavily criticized for launching FBI investigations that targeted journalists' government sources and using the Espionage Act, a law enacted shortly after the U.S. entered World War I to prosecute spies and traitors, to successfully convict government officials who leaked confidential information to journalists. Both administrations ordered additional polygraph examinations and employed aggressive tactics to find leakers, seizing phone and email records of reporters and intelligence community members.",
      "\"Since the start of President Trump's second term, we have seen numerous unauthorized disclosures of classified information, which have the potential to damage U.S. strategic alliances and credibility and endanger sources and methods vital to intelligence gathering,\" DNI spokesperson Olivia Coleman told CBS News.",
      "She added, \"The fact that deep state actors leaked information about DNI Gabbard's directive, aimed at preventing leaks and protecting classified information, to the media is both deeply ironic and a powerful reminder of why her efforts to identify and deter leakers is urgently necessary.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Gabbard said she made criminal referrals regarding two cases to the Justice Department, with a third on its way, which included an illegal leak of information to The Washington Post about the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "While Gabbard's mandate reinforces policies implemented by previous administrations and existing legal statutes, it could generate a fresh round of criticism echoing what previous administrations faced over press freedoms and the relationship between journalists and government sources.",
      "Critics have historically argued that these types of policy directives are intended to create a chilling effect between national security reporters and U.S. government whistleblowers. Activists have said it's problematic to prosecute officials who leak to the press under the same law \u2014 the Espionage Act \u2014 used to prosecute spies and traitors.",
      "\"This is an obnoxious flexing of bureaucratic muscle by yet another Trump agency head seeking to intimidate and abuse their workforce. Gabbard has the authority to impose this requirement, but it's a serious waste of finite resources that will do little but force out a few officials and disrupt agency operations in the interim,\" Bradley Moss, a national security attorney, who specializes in national security and the security clearance process told CBS News.",
      "Moss is a partner at the Washington, D.C., law office of Mark Zaid, whose clearance was stripped in March by President Trump following an executive order. Zaid, who filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in May to have his security clearance restored, had represented a whistleblower key to Mr. Trump's first impeachment.",
      "\"Everyone should keep an eye on those officials who are exempt from this requirement and how closely politically aligned they are with Gabbard,\" said Moss.",
      "Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported last week that the Pentagon is planning to implement widespread random polygraph testing while also requiring service members, civilian employees and contract workers within the Office of the Defense Secretary and the Joint Staff to sign a nondisclosure agreement, according to two unnamed people familiar with the proposal and documents obtained by the newspaper.",
      "In response to the reporting by the Post last week, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told CBS News: \"The Washington Post's reporting is untrue and irresponsible anonymously sourced garbage.\"",

Israel believes 20 of them are still alive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive, closed-door negotiations.",

      "The plan envisions Israel withdrawing its troops from Gaza after Hamas disarms, and an international security force being put in place. The territory would be placed under international governance, with Mr. Trump and former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair overseeing it.",
      "In a statement issued Tuesday, Hamas reiterated its longstanding demands for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza but said nothing about disarmament.",
      "The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists stormed into southern Israel and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. Most have since been released in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "The war that has ensued has killed at least 67,160 Palestinians and left nearly 170,000 wounded, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, says more than half of the deaths were women and children.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the hostilities have created \"a humanitarian catastrophe on a scale that defied comprehension.\" Mr. Trump's proposal \"presents an opportunity that must be seized to bring this tragic conflict to an end,\" he said in a statement.",

      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \"dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \"This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\"",
      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",

      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",
      "Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received more help than they expected, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Oct 2025 12:01:00 -0400",
    "summary": "In her memoir \"Unscripted,\" Hines reflects on her relationship with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., her new role in Washington and why humor helps her handle it all.",
    "story": [
      "Actor Cheryl Hines may be best known for her role alongside Larry David on HBO's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" but these days, she's navigating a very different kind of spotlight \u2014 as the wife of Secretary of Health and Human Services\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "\"I don't think I'll ever get used to being a political spouse. A Cabinet spouse,\" Hines told CBS News' Natalie Morales.",
      "She's speaking about it in her new memoir, \"Unscripted,\" where she reflects on her unexpected journey from Hollywood to Washington politics.",
      "Hines moved to Washington earlier this year after Kennedy joined President Trump's Cabinet as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. It was David, her longtime co-star, who introduced her to Kennedy. The couple married in 2014.",
      "In 2023, Hines supported her husband's presidential campaign, but the experience brought deep anxiety and growing concerns for his safety. She said Kennedy did not receive United States Secret Service protection after launching his 2024 campaign in April of that year.",
      "Hines said she often is worried about his safety given the Kennedy family's history. Kennedy's father, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential campaign \u2014 just five years after his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was killed in Dallas while riding in a motorcade.",
      "Navigating the vaccine debate",
      "Those fears intensified as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became a prominent critic of COVID and vaccines, though Hines said their conflicting views haven't strained their relationship.",
      "\"I'm definitely the one that has all the feelings and he's the one that wants to talk about the facts and the studies, and so sometimes we really have a hard time communicating,\" Hines said. \"Bobby and I, we're able to disagree on things. I mean, sometimes we have heated discussions, but we always come back around to, 'I hear what you're saying.'\"",
      "When asked about her stance on vaccines, Hines didn't say where she stands on the debate, but said she sees both sides of the issue.",
      "\"I understand how people feel like, 'We have to do it. Do not question it. If that's what's coming down from the government, let's trust that.' I understand that,\" she said. \"And then I also understand the mothers, the parents who talk to me personally and say, 'My child was different after they got vaccinated.' Let's listen to people. Let's listen to parents. Let's listen to doctors, to science.\"",
      "Kennedy has clashed with some doctors and scientists who work for him, as well as members of his own family. His cousin Caroline Kennedy has publicly called his views on vaccines \"dangerous\" and \"disqualifying.\"",
      "\"It was hard. I found it to be hard,\" Hines said of the family rift. \"I always thought the Kennedy family, one of their virtues was that family came first, and I admired that. So when some of his family decided to attack him publicly, it was disappointing.\"",
      "Finding humor in politics",
      "Hines said she relies on humor to cope with her new role.",
      "\"I'll just act like I know what I'm doing until someone says, 'Don't curtsy. A curtsy is not needed in this moment,'\" she joked.",
      "The political arena has also affected Hines' personal relationships in Hollywood.",
      "\"I have a few friends, when Bobby stepped into the political arena, it became too difficult emotionally for them to stay close, just a few friends,\" she said. \"And I understand it.\"",
      "When asked what David thought about Kennedy joining the Trump Cabinet, Hines said that'll be a question for David.",
      "\"But let's be honest: He can't love it,\" she said.",
      "Hines said she is making friends in Washington, including with several spouses of other Cabinet members, and recalled that Kennedy once proposed staging a separation to protect her from public criticism.",
      "\"I didn't understand what, how that was gonna help,\" Hines said. \"But I understood what he was talking about. I appreciated it.\"",
      "Their blended families \u2014 her daughter Cat and his six children from two previous marriages \u2014 have provided support through difficult times, including a public feud with some of Kennedy's siblings who opposed his presidential platform.",
      "Hines said even Kennedy's mother, Ethel Kennedy, was surprised by the family division.",
      "\"Bobby told her that he was running for president, and she told him she was proud of him and then asked, 'Who of the siblings are working on your campaign?'\" Hines recounted. \"And he said that they're not working on it and some are opposing him. And she was very surprised.\"",
      "Political violence and moving forward",
      "Hines and Kennedy attended the memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk after his assassination, and she said the dangerous political climate frightens her most.",
      "When asked what needs to be done to lower the political temperature, Hines said: \"I think everyone needs to take a step back, listen to each other and find that place where it is OK to disagree with somebody. It's good to surround yourself with people who don't think exactly like you. But instead of hating somebody for that, maybe taking a minute to understand why they think like that.\"",
      "That philosophy has helped even in her own marriage.",
      "\"We are really close. I like spending time with him. I love him. I love our family and our kids. It's not always gonna be easy, but we also know not everybody's gonna like what you're saying, what you're doing, and that's OK, too. It just is OK. That's life,'\" she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Oct 2025 11:28:31 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of Americans, squeezed by inflation and elevated interest rates, face the risk of losing their home in foreclosure.",
    "story": [
      "Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days.",
      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",
      "\"I just couldn't do it anymore\"",
      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",
      "As of August, foreclosure filings had risen six straights months year-over-year and were up 18% from the same period in 2024, according to property data firm ATTOM. Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",
      "Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances,\u00a0according\u00a0to The Urban Institute, citing\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",
      "\"I did not want to lose my house,\" Draxler said. \"I wouldn't have no place to go.\"",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' lawyers want the hip-hop mogul sent to a low-security federal prison in New Jersey to serve his four-year, two-month prison sentence, telling a judge Monday that the facility's drug treatment program will help him stay clean.",
      "In a letter, Combs' lawyers urged the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to \"strongly recommend\" that the federal Bureau of Prisons place Combs at FCI Fort Dix, a massive prison located on the grounds of the joint military base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.",
      "FCI Fort Dix, one of several dozen federal prisons with a residential drug treatment program, will best allow Combs \"to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos wrote. He also cited educational and occupational programs available at the prison, located about 70 miles south of New York City.",
      "The request from Combs' attorney came after Subramanian asked his lawyers on Friday at the sentencing hearing to let him know their preference for a prison facility.",
      "Also Monday, President Trump told reporters that Combs had asked him for a pardon. Mr. Trump, referring to Combs by the nickname \"Puff Daddy,\" did not say if he would grant the request. Messages seeking comment on Mr. Trump's remarks were left for Combs' lawyers and his publicity team by The Associated Press.",
      "Combs' sentencing for two prostitution-related charges capped a federal case that featured harrowing testimony about violence, drugs and so-called \"freak-offs,\" and exposed the sordid private life of one of the most influential figures in music.",
      "While the criminal case against Combs came to an end, he still faces civil lawsuits, including from a former stylist who accused Combs of sexually, physically and emotionally abusing him while he was working for Combs and his label, Bad Boy Entertainment \u2014 allegations that Combs has denied, with his legal team calling them \"falsehoods.\"",
      "Deonte' Nash alleged he was frightened throughout his roughly decade-long experience working for the music mogul. The 39-year-old stylist claims Combs choked him multiple times, describing one alleged incident that occurred after he went to a restaurant with R&B singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend whose testimony was critical in his conviction.",
      "The \"I'll Be Missing You\" singer was convicted in July under the federal\u00a0Mann Act, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime. His trial ended in a split verdict, with acquittals on sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have put him behind bars for life.",
      "Combs has been locked up at a federal jail in Brooklyn, the Metropolitan Detention Center, since his September 2024 arrest. His time there will be subtracted from his sentence, meaning he could get out in about three years.",
      "In a letter to Subramanian on the eve of sentencing, Combs said he has gone through a \"spiritual reset\" in jail and is \"committed to the journey of remaining a drug free, non-violent and peaceful person.\"",
      "\"I thank God that I'm stronger, wiser, clean, clear and sober,\" he wrote.",
      "Subramanian has not yet acted on the request to recommend placement at FCI Fort Dix.",
      "Judges often make recommendations about where inmates should serve time, but it's up to the Bureau of Prisons to decide. Those decisions, the agency has said, are based on a variety of factors, including the severity of the offense, the required security level and an inmate's programming needs.",
      "FCI Fort Dix, the largest single federal prison by population with just under 3,900 inmates, is about 64 miles southwest of New York City, where Combs was born and rose to fame as a rapper and entrepreneur in an array of businesses, including fashion, television and liquor. An adjacent minimum-security prison camp has 210 inmates.",
      "Combs once owned a home in New Jersey, selling it nearly a decade ago.",
      "His primary residence, according to court papers, has been a $48 million mansion on an island near Miami. That home and a mansion he owns in Los Angeles were raided by federal agents last year during the investigation that led to his arrest.",
      "FCI Fort Dix has been home to a number of high-profile inmates over the years, including reputed mobsters, drug traffickers, corrupt politicians and Martin Shkreli. For a time, it was run by the warden who had been in charge of a Manhattan federal jail when financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himself at the jail in 2019. That warden, Lamine N'Diaye, has since retired.",
      "In 2021, a 27-year-old Fort Dix inmate was stabbed in the eyeball by a fellow prisoner.",
      "In 2019, a Fort Dix inmate, a former inmate and two other people were arrested for using a drone to smuggle in contraband including cellphones, tobacco, weight-loss supplements and eyeglasses. The same year, a Fort Dix correctional officer pleaded guilty in a separate case to pocketing bribes to smuggle in contraband.",

      "\"The United States would cede leadership to other countries, especially [the] China National Space Administration,\" if funding to NASA Science is cut, Nye said. In an interview on \"The Takeout\" following the protest, Nye argued NASA's budget is just \"a sliver of the pie\" of the nearly $1.7 trillion federal budget.",
      "\"It's barely the width of the pie cutter, it's less than 0.1% of the federal budget and the return is extraordinary,\" he told CBS News' Major Garrett.",
      "A White House budget proposal\u00a0issued\u00a0earlier this year would see NASA's funding cut by about 25% for fiscal year 2026, from about $24 billion to $18.8 billion.",
      "Nye, the CEO of Planetary Society and former host of \"Bill Nye the Science Guy,\" and around 300 space advocates said Monday\u00a0that dozens of missions would be at risk \u2014 including NASA's Perseverance Mars rover and the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time in half a century \u2014 if the cuts are approved by Congress.",
      "Despite the proposed cuts, NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, said last month as he introduced a new class of 10 NASA astronaut candidates that there's a possibility one of them could be among the first Americans to put their boots on Mars. However, flights are not yet on the drawing board, and most experts say no such NASA mission is likely to launch within the next decade, and probably longer.",
      "Duffy also said he was confident the U.S. would beat China and win the second space race back to the moon.",
      "Referring to the recent news of Mars rover Perseverance uncovering\u00a0rocks that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, Nye said a NASA budget cut would put the U.S. behind as China plans to launch its sample-return mission in 2028, possibly bringing back samples in 2033.",
      "\"Everybody, understand that if we were to find evidence of life on another world, it would change the course of human history,\" he added. \"So you say, 'Well, how much does that cost?' We're not sure. We've never done it.\"",
      "The 69-year-old science advocate said investing in NASA is \"priceless,\" telling Garrett: \"NASA also, objectively, every dollar that goes into NASA Science comes back at least a factor of three times, so if you put $1 into NASA Science, you're going to get $3 back into the economy.\"",

      "Re'im, southern Israel \u2014\u00a0The people of Israel were marking a grim milestone on Tuesday, mourning their dead two years after the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led terrorist attack. Some 1,200 people were killed that day, most of them civilians, and 251 others taken hostage. Israeli officials believe 48 people are still being held captive in Gaza, only 20 of them believed to be alive.",
      "Their families are desperate for a deal to end the war and bring their loved ones home.",
      "Indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel were entering a second day in Egypt, spurred by President Trump's calls for both sides to agree to a ceasefire based on his recently announced 20-point peace proposal.",
      "Pressure has been mounting on Israel and Hamas not only from the White House but from around the world, with many of Israel's Arab neighbors pushing Hamas to accept a peace agreement and backing Mr. Trump's proposal.",
      "In a message marking what he called \"the most brutal terrorist attack in Israel's history,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirmed the U.S. government's \"unwavering support for Israel's right to exist, to defend itself, and to ensure the safety of its people.\"",
      "Rubio said the Trump administration was \"leading the effort to secure the release of all hostages, end Hamas's rule in Gaza, and advance a durable peace that ensures not only Israel's security, but generational peace and prosperity for the region.\"",
      "\"I have said it time and again, and I am repeating it today with even greater urgency: Release the hostages, unconditionally and immediately,\" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. \"Put an end to the hostilities in Gaza, Israel and the region now. Stop making civilians pay with their lives and their futures.\"",
      "The main Oct. 7 memorial event, in Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, was organized by the bereaved families \u2014 not the government, reflecting deep divisions over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership since the attack.",
      "Many Israelis blame him for failing to bring all the hostages home.",
      "\"We can't move on, we can't,\" said Eden Ganam, whose cousin, Yosef Ohana, is still in captivity in Gaza. \"This is not the same life that we had before October 7. \"We thought it would be maybe a month, a couple of days, but two years?\"",
      "The Hamas attack sparked Israel's ongoing, devastating war in the Gaza Strip. More than 67,000 people have been killed, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Ministry of Health. Huge swaths of the coastal enclave, home to more than 2 million people, have been destroyed.",
      "On Monday, the community of Nir Oz \u2014 where more than 400 residents were either killed or abducted \u2014 came together in song and prayer.",
      "Irit Lahav was hiding with her daughter in their safe room on that day two years ago.  \"We were holding hands, and we thought, 'That's it.  These are our last minutes,'\" she said. \"We just said loving words to each other. Goodbye words.\"",
      "Another memorial was set up Tuesday at the site of the Nova music festival, close to the Gaza border in the southern Israeli desert. It was overrun by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7 two years ago, and almost 380 people were killed.",
      "Orit Baron, whose daughter Yuval was among the festival goers killed that day, along with her fiance Moshe Shuva, told the French news agency AFP that she came to the site \"to be with her, because this is the last time that she was alive.\"",
      "Baron was among dozens of friends and relatives of those killed, and others just wishing to pay their respects. Many lit candles and stood for one minute in silence, remembering those lost to terrorism.",
      "As they did, the sounds of the war in Gaza, just a few miles away, continued reverberating through the air.",

      "The official said Hamas has demanded guarantees that Israel won't return to war after the release of the remaining 48 hostages who were taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Israel believes 20 of them are still alive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive, closed-door negotiations.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the war will only end when all the remaining hostages are returned and Hamas \u2014 which the U.S. and Israel consider to be a terrorist organization \u2014 has been disarmed. He has accepted Mr. Trump's plan, which calls for Gaza to be placed under international governance and for Hamas to be disarmed \u2014 demands that its leaders have yet to accept.",
      "The plan has received widespread international backing. Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday that he thought there was a \"really good chance\" of a lasting deal.",
      "\"This is beyond Gaza,\" he said. \"Gaza is a big deal, but this is really peace in the Middle East.\"",
      "The plan envisions Israel withdrawing its troops from Gaza after Hamas disarms, and an international security force being put in place. The territory would be placed under international governance, with Mr. Trump and former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair overseeing it.",
      "In a statement issued Tuesday, Hamas reiterated its longstanding demands for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza but said nothing about disarmament.",
      "The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists stormed into southern Israel and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. Most have since been released in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "The war that has ensued has killed at least 67,160 Palestinians and left nearly 170,000 wounded, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, says more than half of the deaths were women and children.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the hostilities have created \"a humanitarian catastrophe on a scale that defied comprehension.\" Mr. Trump's proposal \"presents an opportunity that must be seized to bring this tragic conflict to an end,\" he said in a statement.",

About six months later, Hamas\u00a0released a video of him alive, but after more than 300 days in captivity, the 23-year-old Israeli-American was killed by his captors as Israeli troops moved in on their location in late August 2024.",

We have such a surplus of suffering in this neck of the woods. And we are desperate for the decision-makers and the people of power to make it end. We don't have the ability to do that tragically.\"",
      "She said ending the suffering would require leadership, \"on both sides.\"",

We see hundreds of thousands of people going out with signs saying, 'President Trump, get this over the finish line. President Trump, bring these people home. President Trump, end this war.' And he has posted that it is those very voices that he has heard. And oftentimes we say, does my voice matter? Does my little voice matter if I'm going out on the street with my cute little homemade sign, does it matter? And the resounding answer \u2026 Yes. It matters.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas this week started indirect talks on a plan to end the war in Gaza. The talks come after President Trump released a 20-point plan to end the war, which he presented during a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House last week.",
      "Hamas \u2014 which is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and many other nations \u2014 in a statement Friday said it agreed to some of the plan's provisions, such as releasing all the remaining hostages, living and deceased, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and handing over control of the Gaza Strip to a transitional international body. According to Mr. Trump's proposal, the exchange would see the 48 remaining Israeli hostages released. Israeli officials believe about 20 of them are still alive.",

      "About 15 minutes later, he heard people outside.",
      "\"Then I understand that it is very severe, and it's not only missile attack. It's something much more complicated,\" Ben Ami said as Israel prepared to mark two years since the attack.",
      "He started receiving messages from neighbors who told him that attackers had entered their houses. So he crawled from his safe room to try to secure the doors to his home. Then, he was shot.",
      "As he retreated to his safe room, attackers followed him. They easily opened the door behind him, which was only meant to protect those inside from projectiles or flames and could not be locked.",

      "\"I was sure I'm going to be dead,\" he said.",

      "During his time as a hostage, Ben Ami was moved from apartment to apartment. Many did not have running water or functioning toilets.",

      "Sometimes he was held with other hostages, including \u2014 for a time \u2014 his wife Raz Ben Ami, who had been captured as well. She was freed in the first hostage and prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hamas later in 2023.",
      "Ben Ami was moved below ground, into the Hamas tunnel network, where he said there was no light, very little food, and the sanitary conditions were extremely poor.",
      "He was put into an area with two other hostages, Elkaha Bohbot and Bar Kuperstein. Three more Israeli captives joined them, but the amount of food they received did not increase.",
      "\"All the time, we are hungry. We are very nervous. We try to struggle and to get used to the situation,\" he said.",

      "\"They [Hamas] let us see television 15 minutes once in a month \u2026 so we saw that the people in Israel are fighting for us,\" he said. \"They [Hamas] told us that our government don't want us back. The army, Israeli army, is looking to kill us. The Israeli government won't pay the price. And our families are quiet. But when we saw on the TV that all of Israel go out \u2026 this give us hope.

    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Rescue workers were helping hundreds of hikers trapped by heavy snow at tourist campsites on a slope of Mount Everest in Tibet, Chinese state media said late Sunday.",
      "About 350 hikers had reached a meeting point in Tingri country and rescuers were in contact with another 200, state broadcaster CCTV said. There was no immediate update on rescue efforts on Monday.",
      "The hikers were trapped at an elevation of more than 16,000 feet, according to an earlier report from Jimu News, a Chinese online site. Mount Everest is about 29,000 feet tall.",
      "A hiker who rushed to descend before snow blocked the way told Jimu News that others still on the mountain told him the snow was 3 feet deep and had crushed tents.",
      "Another hiker who made it to safety is quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying, \"It was so wet and cold in the mountains, and hypothermia was a real risk. The weather this year is not normal. The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly.\"",
      "Hundreds of rescuers headed up the mountain Sunday to clear paths so trapped people could come down, the Jimu report said. A video shot by a villager showed a long line of people with horses and oxen moving up a winding path in the snow.",
      "The snowstorm struck during a weeklong national holiday in China, when many travel at home and abroad.",
      "In another mountainous region in western China, one hiker died of hypothermia and altitude sickness and 137 others were evacuated in the northern part of Qinghai province, CCTV said Monday.",
      "The search in an area in Menyuan County with an average altitude of more than 13,100 feet was being complicated by the terrain, unpredictable weather and continuous snowfall, a CCTV online report said.",
      "Mount Everest, known as Mount Qomolangma in Chinese, straddles the border between China and Nepal, where recent heavy rains have wiped away villages and caused landslides, leaving more than 40 people dead.",
      "Climbers attempt to scale the world's tallest peak from base camps in both countries. The base camp for climbers is separate from the tourist camp where hikers were trapped by the snowfall.",
      "A strong earthquake killed at least 126 people in the same area in January.",
      "The Chinese side of Everest is in Tibet, a remote western region where the government has cracked down harshly on dissent and poured in funds for economic development including roads and tourism.",
      "The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, fled during a failed uprising in 1959 and lives in India, where some Tibetans have set up a government in exile.",

    "summary": "President Trump wants Israeli and Hamas negotiators to \"move fast\" in new talks aimed at securing a ceasefire in the Gaza war, spurred by his 20-point plan.",
    "story": [
      "Jerusalem \u2014\u00a0Israel and Hamas have started indirect talks on a plan to end the war in Gaza.",
      "An Egyptian official \u2014 speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the talks \u2014 told The Associated Press that the talks started at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday.",
      "Egypt's state-owned Al-Qahera News TV station reported that the talks began with a meeting between a Hamas delegation and Arab mediators, who were expected to meet later with an Israeli delegation.",
      "Negotiators were expected to discuss President Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza, which was sparked two years ago, on Oct. 7, by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel. Mr. Trump presented his plan during a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House last Monday.",
      "Hamas \u2014 which is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and many other nations \u2014 issued a statement on Friday saying it agreed to some of the key points in the plan, including releasing all the remaining hostages, living and deceased, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. It also said it agreed to handing over control of Gaza to a transitional international body.",
      "But Hamas did not immediately agree to other points in Mr. Trump's proposal, including some related to its disarmament and future role in Palestinian politics.",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday urged the negotiators to \"move fast\" in the talks, calling ongoing discussions between Hamas and other nations in the region about the ceasefire proposal \"very successful.\" He said they were \"proceeding rapidly.\"",
      "\"The technical teams will again meet Monday, in Egypt, to work through and clarify the final details,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST. I will continue to monitor this Centuries old 'conflict.' TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE OR, MASSIVE BLOODSHED WILL FOLLOW \u2013 SOMETHING THAT NOBODY WANTS TO SEE!\"",
      "On Monday, the Israeli Hostages Families Forum, which represents most of the families of those still missing, sent a letter to the Nobel Prize committee urging them to bestow the Nobel Peace Prize on Mr. Trump for his \"unwavering commitment and extraordinary leadership\" in seeking a deal to bring the remaining captives home.",
      "The forum said it was backing Mr. Trump for a Nobel \"with hearts full of gratitude and a profound sense of momentous urgency,\" lauding the president's \"determination to bring peace.\"",
      "\"At this very moment, President Trump's comprehensive plan to release all remaining hostages andfinally end this terrible war is on the table,\" the forum says in its letter. \"For the first time in months, we are hopeful that our nightmare will finally be over. We are confident that he will not rest until the last hostage is brought home, the war has ended, and peace and prosperity are restored to the people of the Middle East.\"",
      "Egypt's foreign ministry said\u00a0the talks would focus on \"establishing the necessary humanitarian and logistical conditions for implementing a prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hamas.\"",
      "According to Mr. Trump's proposal, the exchange would see the 48 remaining Israeli hostages released. Israeli officials believe about 20 of them are still alive. After that, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners who are being held by Israel would be freed. Of those prisoners, 250 are serving life sentences and 1,700 are from Gaza and were detained after the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "The talks will also \"address the details of the process in line with the plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, aimed at ending the war and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza,\" Egypt's foreign ministry said.",
      "Amid the signs of a potential deal, Israeli strikes continued Sunday in Gaza, although CBS News sources said there were fewer than before Mr. Trump's proposal was announced. The IDF said it \"struck and eliminated a terrorist cell armed with explosive devices and mortars that were intended to be used in terror attacks against IDF troops in the area of Gaza City.\"",
      "An Israeli government spokesperson said Sunday that \"certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip,\" but they added that there is \"no ceasefire in place at this point in time.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that Israel's bombing of Gaza would need to stop for the remaining hostages to be released.",
      "\"I'd give it a 50% shot of happening, because both sides feel the pressure to get this done. Israel feels the pressure from the U.S., and Hamas feels the pressure from Qatar, from Turkey, from Egypt, from Jordan, and from Saudi Arabia,\" former senior Israeli diplomat Alon Pinkas told CBS News on Monday, referring to the possible hostage and prisoner swap. \"As for the rest of the plan, the likelihood goes down from 50% to maybe 10%. I just doubt it's going to happen. Even this phase is going to be as ambiguous and amenable to interpretations, and I don't see it going smoothly.\"",
      "Ohad Ben Ami, who was captured by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attack and released in a prisoner swap in February, said he was eager for a deal to get done.",
      "\"Now it seems like there is hope,\" Ben Ami said over the weekend at an event. He added that felt betrayed by Israel's government.",
      "\"I love my country, and I love the people, but our government is disconnected. And until now, I have the feeling of insult. I feel that they abandoned me,\" he said.",
      "During his time in captivity, Ben Ami was first held above ground in a series of apartments in Gaza before being moved down into Hamas' vast tunnel network underneath the Palestinian territory, where he said he and other hostages were kept in squalid conditions and not given enough to eat.",
      "\"I'm here with you. I speak and I talk, but in my mind, I'm down there,\" Ben Ami said at the Sunday event. \"Until they \u2026 come back, all the 48 (remaining hostages), I cannot live. I'm still a hostage. I'm a free man, but not in my soul.\"",

    "story": [
      "East China Sea \u2014\u00a0Over the deep blue waters of the East China Sea, a Canadian military aircraft surveys the vast expanse below. The CP-140 Aurora, a maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force, is designed primarily to hunt enemy submarines \u2014 but this crew is on a different mission: tracking North Korean vessels engaged in illicit trade that violates United Nations sanctions.",
      "\"There are definitely some boats that look more suspicious than others,\" the captain currently deployed on the operation tells CBS News as he pilots the plane. The Canadian air force asked CBS News not to use the captain's name as he is still on active duty.",
      "Operating in international airspace over international waters, the mission \u2014 known as Operation NEON \u2014 takes the plane close to Chinese territory, often triggering a dramatic response by Beijing, which intercepts the Aurora on multiple occasions during its mission while a CBS News crew is onboard.",
      "Operation NEON is Canada's contribution to a coordinated multinational effort to support the implementation of U.N. Security Council sanctions against North Korea, as U.N. member states seek to apply pressure on Pyongyang to abandon its programs developing weapons of mass destruction.",
      "NEON is an intelligence gathering mission \u2014 they take photos, video and log suspicious vessels in the East China Sea, and then share the information with the United Nations' Enforcement Coordination Cell.",
      "The mission is based out of Kadena Air Base in Japan \u2014 the largest U.S. Air Force base in the Asia-Pacific region \u2014 known as the \"keystone of the Pacific\" due to its strategic importance.",
      "During the mission, a Chinese supersonic fighter jet appears and approaches the Canadian air force plane.",
      "Unhappy with the Canadian presence, the Chinese pilot hails Aurora's captain, who calmly responds: \"I'm a Canadian aircraft operating in international airspace, carrying out the duties of all nations.\"",
      "There is no verbal reply from the Chinese, but the Chinese fighter jet shadows the Aurora for another 30 minutes or so.",
      "\"As long as things remain professional and safe, this mission continues unabated,\" Brigadier General Jeff Davis, who commands the Canadian operation, tells CBS News.",
      "Soon after, the Chinese fighter jet disappears, but it's only a temporary halt to the Chinese actions. A few hours later, another jet appears, this one carrying missiles. All crew members move into position to document the second intercept.",
      "The jet, flying just four wing lengths' away \u2014 less than 200 feet \u2014 comes closer than any Chinese fighter has come to the Aurora throughout its mission.",
      "China has been North Korea's economic lifeline since international sanctions were imposed on Pyongyang in 2006, after its first nuclear test.",
      "But the sanctions clearly have not had the desired effect. Russia and China used to be opposed to North Korea's nuclear development, but not any more.",
      "China has been a vital economic lifeline for the Kim regime in Pyongyang, propping up North Korea's economy. More recently, Russia has also played a big role, giving the North oil in exchange for ammunition and troops deployed in support of Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "The Kim dynasty has long hoped to force the world to accept North Korea as a nuclear power. It's currently estimated to possess approximately 50 nuclear weapons, and is on the verge of developing a long-range missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the U.S. mainland.",
      "Near the end of August, while meeting South Korea's new president, President Trump said he wanted another meeting with Kim Jong Un. They met three times during Mr. Trump's first term, but the summits garnered no results toward denuclearizing North Korea.",
      "Kim has said since that he's open to continuing the dialogue only if Mr. Trump abandons his government's \"absurd obsession with denuclearization.\"",
      "While these Chinese intercepts of the international sanctions enforcement mission over the East China Sea are expected, they undeniably increase the risks for the Canadian crew.",
      "\"It can add some stressors,\" the Canadian pilot tells CBS News. \"Sometimes they're trying to maneuver, but we try to mitigate as best we can and keep the aircraft safe.\"",

    "story": [
      "Less than a year after the landmark verdict in a drugging and rape trial that shook France and turned Gis\u00e8le Pelicot into a global icon, she was greeted with applause Monday as she arrived at a courthouse for the appeal of a man challenging his conviction.",
      "Husamettin Dogan, sentenced to nine years in prison last December, denies he intended to rape Pelicot. He argues that he was deceived by Dominique Pelicot, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's ex-husband, who drugged his wife and offered her to strangers online before filming the assaults.",
      "The 44-year-old construction worker went on trial Monday in Nimes, in southern France, on charges of aggravated rape by administering substances that impair judgment or self-control, an offense carrying up to 20 years in prison.",
      "He remains free pending the verdict. Prosecutors had sought 12 years at his first trial, but the court imposed nine.",
      "Wearing a pink jacket, Pelicot entered the courthouse under police escort, smiling as she shook hands with supporters who shouted \"Thank you!\" and other words of encouragement.",
      "In the original proceedings, Pelicot's ex-husband and 50 other men were convicted of sexually assaulting her between 2011 and 2020 while she was under chemical submission. Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in prison, while sentences for other defendants ranged from three to 15 years imprisonment.",
      "The trial drew international attention after Gis\u00e8le Pelicot opposed a closed hearing, a demand made by several defendants. The court sided with her.",
      "According to the French newspaper Le Monde, which covered the trial, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot at one point said in court that the reason she wanted the hearings to happen publicly was so that \"all women who are victims of rape can say to themselves: 'Madame Pelicot did it, so we can do it.'\"",
      "\"I don't want them to feel ashamed anymore. It's not for us to feel shame \u2014 it's for them [sexual attackers],\" she said. \"Above all, I'm expressing my will and determination to change this society.\"",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot said on the trial's opening day that \"shame must change sides.\" After the verdict, she declared she had \"never regretted that decision\" to push for public proceedings and thanked supporters who gave her the \"strength\" to return to court each day.",
      "The evidence presented at trial included stomach-churning homemade videos of the abuse that Dominique Pelicot filmed in the couple's home in the small Provence town of Mazan and elsewhere.",
      "A national reckoning",
      "Pelicot has since become a symbol of the fight against sexual violence and the shocking case spurred a national reckoning over rape culture in France. Her trial sparked protests across the country, and some demonstrators said they hoped the case could catalyze changes to certain French laws that deal with consent.",
      "Dominique Pelicot admitted his role and did not appeal his 20-year prison sentence, now final. He is expected to testify during the appeals hearing after being implicated by the remaining defendant.",
      "Of the 51 convicted men, 17 initially filed appeals. Most of those were withdrawn and only Dogan pursued his appeal.",
      "While last year's trial stretched over four months, the retrial is scheduled to last no more than four days, with a verdict expected Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "On a recent afternoon, Kenrick Modie finished untangling his fishing net in a quiet Caribbean village.",
      "As he slipped into a hammock at his home overlooking the sea, he worried that his life and livelihood could be wiped out by a U.S. military strike.",
      "Modie lives in the Caribbean twin-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago, which is now entangled in a geopolitical face-off between the United States and Venezuela, just 11 miles away.",
      "U.S. President Trump \"is giving instructions to shoot and kill people,\" Modie said about recent U.S. military strikes targeting suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean as it bulks up its military presence in the region. \"What could we do? We're just a little dot.\"",
      "The United States has carried out at least four strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats in the waters off Venezuela in recent weeks, with at least two of the vessels originating from Venezuela. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the fourth strike on Friday, saying \"four male narco-terrorists\" were killed, but offering no other details on who they were.",
      "Mr. Trump declared in a notification to Congress viewed by CBS News that the U.S. was in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels in the Caribbean, alleging they are trying to bring \"deadly poison\" to U.S. shores.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuela has accused the U.S. of military buildup and aggression, prompting President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to place the country's military and civilians willing to take up arms on high alert.",
      "Stuck in the middle is Trinidad and Tobago, a nation with a multimillion-dollar fishing industry that employs thousands of fishermen who cast their nets almost daily to sustain themselves and their families.",
      "\"If we die, we die\"",
      "Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar has said that drug cartels have contributed to pain and suffering in her country, and she has urged the U.S. to \"kill them all violently.\"",
      "She also said she is willing to grant the U.S. access to Trinidad and Tobago, if needed, so Americans can defend Guyana from neighboring Venezuela, which has claimed two-thirds of Guyana as its own.",
      "Maduro said that Persad-Bissessar's willingness to grant such access is like declaring war against Venezuela. The Venezuelan president has called for a return to good relations with its Caribbean neighbor, even as Trinidad and Tobago's government claims there's no bad blood between the countries.",
      "While those in authority trade words and military commanders ramp up their posturing, dozens of fishermen in Trinidad and Tobago feel their lives are at risk, given the ongoing U.S. strikes and escalation of tensions with Venezuela.",
      "\"If we die, we die, that's how this life is,\" Modie said.",
      "He fears being killed by a U.S. military strike while out fishing because he believes his boat could be mistaken for a drug-smuggling vessel. Modie said he hasn't seen substantial evidence that those killed in the U.S. strikes were indeed transporting drugs. He also worries about innocent fishermen being killed and falsely labelled as narco-terrorists by authorities, with the dead men being unable to clear their names.",
      "Fishing in fear",
      "Only seven miles separate Trinidad and Venezuela at their closest point. On a clear day, Venezuela is visible from the village of Icacos, which is located on Trinidad's southwestern tip.",
      "Driving around Icacos and neighboring Cedros village, dozens of boats strewn along the shoreline show how heavily these communities depend on fishing.",
      "Fishermen in these two villages say they are already under threat from pirates, and the military buildup at sea now adds yet another threat.",
      "Watching three other fishermen unload their catch for the day at the Cedros Fishing Complex, Kamal Bikeran said his crew now stays in shallower waters and isn't going as far out to sea as before, because of the tension involving the three countries.",
      "\"The U.S. has come there, and the Venezuelan military is saying they are more present, so you have to watch out,\" Bikeran said. \"At any point in time, outside there, you could be taken out.\"",
      "Forced to fish in shallower waters, Bikeran and other fishermen said the heightened regional tension is drying up their livelihoods, as they are now catching fewer fish.",
      "Mr. Trump gave fishermen a reason to worry after the first U.S. military strike on Sept. 2, which he said killed 11 suspected narco-terrorists.",
      "\"Boat traffic is substantially down,\" Mr. Trump said in early September. \"I don't even know about fishermen. They may say, 'I'm not getting on the boat.'\"",
      "The president repeated that sentiment in remarks Sunday at an event celebrating 250 years of the U.S. Navy in Norfolk, Virginia, saying, \"We're so good at it that there are no boats. In fact, even fishing boats. Nobody wants to go into the water anymore.\"",
      "Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in late September, Caribbean leaders referred to the region as a zone of peace.",
      "Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley appealed for dialogue to avoid a war between the U.S. and Venezuela. The prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Ralph Gonsalves, described the foreign militarization of the waters near Venezuela as \"exceedingly troubling.\"",
      "Fishing in fear has become the new reality, said Shyam Hajarie, who has been a fisherman for more than 40 years. The Cedros native, like others, depends on his daily catches to support his family. He's unsure if the military buildup in the Caribbean would soon affect fish prices at the market.",

      "Takaichi was chosen by her party members to lead, and as her party holds the most seats in Japan's parliament, she is set to become the prime minister. She was not elected personally by Japanese voters in a national election.",
      "A staunch supporter of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's conservative vision, Takaichi is on the verge of losing her party's long-time coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed dovish centrist Komeito, because of her ultra-conservative politics. Those include a revisionism of wartime history and regular visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a symbol of militarism.",
      "faces the dilemma of sticking to her ideology and losing the coalition partner or shifting to the center, which would lose her fans of her hawkish politics.",
      "The LDP and opposition parties are currently considering convening the parliament in mid-October to formally elect a new prime minister.",
      "Takaichi is likely to be Japan's leader because the LDP, even without a majority in either house of parliament following consecutive election losses, is still by far the largest in the lower house, which decides the national leader, and because opposition groups are highly splintered.",
      "She will need to address rising prices to restore support for the struggling party.",
      "She also faces another big test when she hosts a possible summit later this month with Mr. Trump as his trip to Asia to attend international conferences is planned.",
      "In her first press conference Saturday as LDP leader, Takaichi vowed to ensure strengthening of the Japan-U.S. alliance as essential to her country's diplomacy and security, while also seeking to expand trilateral partnerships including South Korea, Australia and the Philippines.",
      "Takaichi said she will honor the tariffs and investment agreements between the government of the current prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba and the Trump administration.",
      "One of Takaichi's most urgent tasks is to secure cooperation from the opposition. The LDP seeks to expand its current coalition with the moderate centrist Komeito to include at least one of the key opposition parties, which are center-right.",
      "But instead of finding a third partner, Takaichi is on the verge of losing Komeito, which is critical of her regular visits to the Yasukuni Shrine and her recent emphasis on stricter measures against the growing foreign population in Japan.",
      "In a rare move that shakes their 26-year-partnership, Komeito leader Tetsuo Saito told Takaichi on Saturday that his party has \"big worry and concern\" about her positions and would not stay in the coalition unless these positions are dropped.",
      "As new party president, Takaichi's first job is to decide a lineup of top LDP party posts, which she is expected to announce Tuesday.",
      "Takaichi has turned to the LDP's most powerful kingmaker and former prime minister Taro Aso, a conservative who backed her and reportedly influenced Saturday's party vote. She is expected to appoint him as deputy prime minister and name his brother-in-law and former Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki as party secretary general.",
      "Aso on Monday met with a senior official of the key opposition Democratic Party for the People about possible cooperation. Another opposition party, Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin no Kai, had been open to a coalition under Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who lost to Takaichi in Saturday's runoff vote, but that is now up in the air.",
      "Political watchers say Takaichi is considering appointing those who voted for her in the runoff as a reward. Among them is Toshimitsu Motegi, who is close to Aso and has served in key ministerial posts including as foreign and trade ministers. He is being considered for the position of top diplomat.",
      "Takaichi has also suggested appointing a number of former Abe faction lawmakers implicated in slush funds and other scandals to senior posts, despite public criticism over the party's lack of reform measures and subsequent election losses.",
      "Yoshihiko Noda, head of the largest opposition, centrist Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, criticized the idea, calling it \"totally unthinkable.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Oct 2025 09:37:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Nobel Prize committee chair says discoveries by the trio of researchers were \"decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions.\"",
    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",
      "The award is the first of the 2025 Nobel Prize announcements and was announced by a panel at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.",
      "Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics Oct. 13.",
      "The award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who founded the prizes. Nobel was a wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite. He died in 1896.",
      "The trio will share the prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (nearly $1.2 million).",

      "Family law attorney Patrick Baghdaserians of Baghdaserians Law Group criticized Phypers for calling Sheen and Glanville to testify, telling Fox News Digital that the \"witness testimony scope is not only irrelevant but seemingly geared towards intimidating and embarrassing Ms. Richards.\"",
      "\"The scope of testimony proffered for Mr. Sheen and Ms. Glanville is largely irrelevant as to whether abuse occurred between the parties,\"\u00a0the legal expert said.",
      "Baghdaserians told Fox News Digital that he found the \"inflammatory and derogatory statements\" about Richards in the witness list to be \"highly unusual.\" He went on to say that it was unlikely that Sheen and Glanville would be allowed to take the stand.",
      "\"In a domestic violence setting, abuse is based on admissible evidence,\" he said. \"Character or historical tendencies generally carry very little weight. For example, whether a victim allegedly had a past problem with drugs or alcohol is largely irrelevant when it comes to whether abuse occurred.\"",
      "Baghdaserians added, \"There is a strong public policy to exclude irrelevant and embarrassing testimony in court. This is even more important when the offered irrelevant testimony is being proffered to seemingly embarrass and or intimidate a purported victim of domestic violence.\"",
      "\"Given this strong public policy, I cannot imagine the judicial officer in this matter allowing either Mr. Sheen or Ms. Glanville to testify against Ms. Richards.\"",
      "Sheen and Richards were married from 2002 to 2006.\u00a0 (Stephen Shugerman)",
      "Sheen and Richards were married from 2002 to 2006 and share daughters Sami, 21, and Lola, 20. In 2005, Richards filed for divorce, citing Sheen's drug addiction as a contributing factor in the breakdown of their marriage.",
      "The \"Two and a Half Men\" star has been open about his own past struggles with alcoholism and substance abuse, and he has been sober since 2017. Sheen has never publicly accused Richards of drug use.",
      "For several years, the two battled in court over child custody and financial support. However, they have since developed an amicable relationship. In a 2023 interview with People, Sheen told the outlet that he and Richards are \"absolutely friendly.\"",
      "The two reunited for her reality show, \"Denise Richards & Her Wild Things.\" (Getty Images)",
      "\"We went through so much s--- together that I don\u2019t think either one of us has any energy left to be divisive,\" he said. \"The only thing that matters is the kids. We knew we had to park our nonsense and focus on the children, because they had nothing to do with any of our crud.\"",
      "\"Even in the hottest portions of depths of the inferno, we were still able to maintain a perspective that yes, the children need to come first,\" Sheen added. \"Now we\u2019re super friendly, and we\u2019re actually able to process so much of it through humor these days.\"",

      "Meanwhile, Glanville and Richards' relationship has been rocky and fraught with tension in recent years. The two formerly co-starred on \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\" but Richards left the show in 2020 after Glanville claimed that they had an affair while the \"Starship Troopers\" actress was married to Phypers.",
      "During a 2020 episode of the show, Glanville claimed that Phypers was \"OK\" with their alleged affair and that she \"knew\" that the former couple \"have an understanding.\"",
      "\"Like, she could be with girls if she wanted to. And as long as, you know, it wasn\u2019t with a guy,\" Glanville said.",
      "'REAL HOUSEWIVES' STAR BRANDI GLANVILLE DETAILS ALLEGED AFFAIR WITH CO-STAR DENISE RICHARDS IN NEW SUPERTEASE",
      "Richards has vehemently denied Glanville's claims. In February 2020, she replied to a fan's comment on Instagram, saying that she and Phypers \"absolutely\" did not have an open marriage and she was \"100% monogamous to my husband.\"",

      "A source also spoke to the outlet, shedding some light on why Phypers wanted Glanville to take the witness stand amid his divorce from Richards.",
      "\"In [an] effort to not allow this [divorce] case to be a Brandi 2.0, Glanville is being called to testify on Richards\u2019s credibility and manipulative moves,\" the insider said.",
      "\"Denise did [Glanville] dirty,\" the source added. \"Aaron Phypers\u2019 witness list includes people who can deny Denise Richards credibility on telling the truth.\"",

      "However, family law attorney\u00a0Holly Davis\u00a0of the firm Kirker Davis agreed with Baghdaserians' assertion that it was unlikely Glanville and Sheen would be allowed to provide witness testimony during the hearings.",

      "The legal expert said, \"The only way this testimony actually gets in to the record over a relevancy objection is if the attorney can somehow show that Denise Richards has a modus operandi when she divorces people, otherwise dragging a person into court to testify that a person lied or did drugs ten years ago is a waste of the court\u2019s time and could be achieved by the testimony of Denise and her husband.\"",
      "\"This is a messy, ugly, high conflict case that will eat up all of the parties\u2019 resources,\" Davis added. \"Denise and her husband need to settle the case, move on with their lives, and forget they ever met if they know what\u2019s good for them. If they continue at this rate, both sides will lose ultimately at a final hearing.\"",

      "The national DSA organization and its chapters, including the NYC-DSA, have shared views on several issues that they have been vocal about, including their disdain for ICE and cracking down on on \"bad landlords\" by having the city take control of properties when a landlord refuses to make repairs or \"demonstrates consistent neglect\" of their tenants.",

      "A Fox News Digital review found that multiple staff members of Mamdani's campaign are directly involved with DSA, including Tascha Van Auken, who has been paid over $100K by the campaign and is the campaign\u2019s field director. In a July 2025 profile piece, she explained how the Mamdani campaign adopted the DSA's model of canvassing.",

Today, it ranks among the world's largest automakers by revenue and is fifth in volume globally. The company houses 14 well-known brands, including Jeep and Dodge, as well as Peugeot, Maserati and Vauxhall, and operates manufacturing infrastructure across more than 130 countries. That global scale naturally makes it a tempting target for cyber adversaries.",
      "Stellantis confirmed hackers stole customer contact details in a recent breach. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "In its public statement, Stellantis clarified that only contact information was taken. Since the compromised third-party platform does not host financial or deeply sensitive personal data, Stellantis asserts that Social Security numbers, payment details and health records were out of reach of the attackers. In response, the company activated its incident response protocols, launched a full investigation, contained the breach, notified authorities and began alerting affected customers. It also issued warnings about phishing and urged customers not to click suspicious links.",

A data removal service can help track down and request the deletion of your information from these databases, reducing your long-term exposure.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Stolen emails and phone numbers could fuel phishing campaigns. (REUTERS /Rebecca Cook)",
      "The most immediate risk after a breach like this is targeted phishing. Attackers now have legitimate contact details, so their emails and texts can look convincingly real. Be skeptical of any message claiming to be from Stellantis, your car brand or a related service, especially if it urges you to click a link, download an attachment or share personal details.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

A password manager can create strong, unique passwords for every account. That way, one breach will not put your other accounts at risk.

      "Attackers often combine exposed contact information with other data to build complete identity profiles. Identity theft protection services monitor for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized credit applications or changes to official records, and alert you early so you can act before serious damage occurs. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at CyberGuy.com.",
      "After a breach, it is worth auditing your accounts, not just with Stellantis but also with related services such as financing portals, insurance accounts or loyalty programs.

      "Even giants in manufacturing are vulnerable when cloud platforms and third-party systems are part of their customer workflow. The same patterns seen in attacks on Google, LVMH and others have now reached the auto industry in a serious way. As Stellantis confronts the fallout, the broader lesson is clear. Organizations must treat the surfaces exposed by their service providers and SaaS integrations with as much vigilance as their own core systems.",

And while there is some truth to that, it does not mean that Macs are immune. Modern malware is smarter, more targeted and often designed to slip past built-in defenses quietly. Recently, I heard from Jeffrey from Phoenix, Arizona, who's been dealing with this exact situation.",

      "WHY IPHONE USERS ARE THE NEW PRIME SCAM TARGETS",
      "Mac malware often hides in the background, making it hard to spot at first. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Signs your Mac might be infected",
      "Spotting malware on macOS is not always straightforward. Many threats are designed to stay hidden, running quietly in the background while collecting data or opening a backdoor for attackers. Still, there are a few red flags that usually signal something is wrong.",
      "One of the first signs is slower performance or frequent overheating. If your Mac suddenly takes a long time to boot, runs hot during light tasks or lags when performing simple actions, it might be doing more behind the scenes than you realize. Apps that crash or freeze more often than usual are another warning sign. Occasional app failures are normal, but if built-in tools like Safari, Notes or Mail begin acting unstable, it may point to malicious interference.",
      "It is also worth paying attention to what is happening under the hood. Checking Activity Monitor for unknown processes or unusually high CPU or memory usage can reveal malware that tries to hide itself with random or unfamiliar names. Redirected web traffic is another classic symptom. If your browser takes you to strange websites, shows pop-ups, or installs new extensions you never approved, adware or spyware might already be present.",
      "Finally, unexplained changes to your security settings should always raise suspicion. If you notice your firewall turned off, privacy permissions modified, or login items appearing without your knowledge, something could have gained unauthorized control of your system.",

      "Strange app behavior, pop-ups or overheating may signal something\u2019s wrong. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How macOS protects you by default",
      "Apple has built several layers of defense into macOS, many of which run silently in the background to keep your system secure. Knowing how they work can help you understand what protections are already in place and where you might still need to add more safeguards.",
      "Gatekeeper is one of the most important built-in security tools. It checks every app before it runs to make sure it comes from a verified developer, warning or blocking you if the app is not trusted. Another layer of defense is XProtect, Apple's built-in malware scanner. It updates automatically and can stop many known threats from running, although it is not as thorough as specialized antivirus software.",
      "System Integrity Protection, or SIP, is another important safeguard. It locks down critical system files and processes so that malware cannot tamper with them even if it gains access. macOS also uses sandboxing and strict permission controls to contain threats. Apps run in isolated environments and must explicitly request permission to access sensitive data such as your camera, files, or location.",
      "Together, these features make it significantly harder for malicious software to infect your Mac or cause serious damage. However, they are not perfect. Attackers are constantly developing new techniques to bypass these protections, and many threats rely on human error rather than technical exploits. That is why taking additional precautions is still essential, even on a Mac.",

      "If you find yourself dealing with a Mac that's already compromised, these steps can help you get back in control:",
      "Unplug Ethernet or turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. This prevents malware from sending more data out or pulling in additional malicious code.",
      "Use an external drive or cloud service you trust. Avoid copying entire system folders \u2013 just grab personal documents, photos and files you can't replace. You don't want to back up the malware along with them.",
      "Restart your Mac and hold the Shift key. Safe Mode prevents some malware from launching and makes it easier to run cleanup tools.",

      "If malware persists, wiping your system may be the only option. Erase your Mac's drive and reinstall macOS from scratch. Restore only the clean files you backed up earlier.",
      "If your iPhone, iPad or other personal devices are showing strange behavior, run security scans, update their software and reset key passwords. Malware can sometimes spread through shared Wi-Fi networks, cloud accounts or files.",

      "macOS's built-in protections are useful but basic. A strong antivirus adds an extra layer by detecting threats in real time, blocking malicious downloads and even identifying new types of malware before they spread. A strong antivirus also scans email attachments and browser activity, areas where many Mac users are most vulnerable.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Malware often tries to run at startup so it can operate undetected. Regularly check System Settings to make sure only trusted apps are launching automatically, and use Activity Monitor to investigate anything suspicious.",
      "If your personal data has already been exposed, an identity theft protection service can monitor for suspicious activity, alert you to breaches and help you recover quickly if something does go wrong. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

If your device is behaving strangely, taking action early is the best way to prevent deeper damage.",

      "Kurt the CyberGuy reports on how Instagram safety tools are not 'foolproof' for kids, shares tips for how to protect teens online and more on 'Fox & Friends.'",
      "Meta is rolling out new protections aimed at making social media safer for young people. In September 2024, Instagram introduced Teen Accounts, which come with built-in safeguards that limit who can contact teens, what content they see and how long they spend on the app.",
      "Since then, adoption has been strong: 97% of teens ages 13-15 kept the default settings, and 94% of parents say Teen Accounts are helpful. Now, Meta is expanding those protections beyond Instagram. Teen Accounts are coming to Facebook and Messenger worldwide, bringing stronger safety standards to more of the apps teens use every day.",

      "Critics and researchers question Meta's teen safety tools",
      "However, not everyone agrees that these protections go far enough.\u00a0Research regarding the effectiveness of Instagram's teen safety features, as reported by child-safety advocacy groups and corroborated by researchers at Northeastern University (Sept. 25, 2025), paints a different picture. The study found that only eight of 47 safety features tested were fully effective, and internal documents suggest that Meta was aware of some shortcomings. Critics also argued that certain protections, like manual comment-hiding, place the burden on teens themselves rather than preventing harm upfront. They questioned whether time management tools were robust enough, giving some features middling grades despite functioning as described.",
      "\"Misleading and dangerously speculative reports such as this one undermine the important conversation about teen safety,\" Meta told CyberGuy, \"This report repeatedly misrepresents our efforts to empower parents and protect teens, misstating how our safety tools work and how millions of parents and teens are using them today.",
      "\"Teen Accounts lead the industry because they provide automatic safety protections and straightforward parental controls. The reality is teens who were placed into these protections saw less sensitive content, experienced less unwanted contact and spent less time on Instagram at night. Parents also have robust tools at their fingertips, from limiting usage to monitoring interactions. We'll continue improving our tools, and we welcome constructive feedback.

      "The program has already reached hundreds of thousands of students, with a goal of teaching one million middle school students in the coming year.

For educators, the School Partnership Program provides a direct connection to Meta, ensuring reports of unsafe behavior get attention quickly. Students benefit too, with a curriculum designed to give them practical tools for navigating online life safely.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Meta's expansion of Teen Accounts marks a major shift in how social platforms approach safety. By adding built-in protections, the company reduces risks for teens without requiring parents to manage every setting. At the same time, the School Partnership Program gives educators new tools to protect students in real time. The online safety curriculum goes one step further by teaching kids how to recognize threats and respond confidently. Still, advocacy groups and independent researchers question whether these efforts are enough, and Meta's strong defense shows just how high the stakes are in the teen safety debate. As teens spend more of their lives online, the responsibility to protect them grows. The real test will be how well these tools hold up against evolving online threats.",

      "Victims are instructed to copy it, open File Explorer, and paste it into the address bar. While it appears harmless, this action secretly runs code that starts the malware infection process.",
      "This method is part of a family of attacks known as ClickFix, where people are tricked into pasting commands into system dialogs. FileFix, created by Red Team researcher mr.d0x, builds on that idea by exploiting the File Explorer address bar instead. In this campaign, the attackers improved the trick by hiding the malicious command behind long strings of spaces, so only the fake file path is visible to the victim.",

StealC goes further by attempting to compromise cloud accounts from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure, VPN services like ProtonVPN and even gaming accounts from Battle.net and Ubisoft. In addition, it can take screenshots of the victim's desktop, giving attackers a live view of sensitive activity.",

      "Attackers rely on panic. Treat any message claiming your Meta account or other services will be disabled within days with caution. Verify the alert directly through official platforms rather than clicking links or following instructions from an email or web page.",

      "FileFix and StealC thrive on the information they can extract from a device or linked accounts.

      "GOOGLE CONFIRMS DATA STOLEN IN BREACH BY KNOWN HACKER GROUP",
      "Chrome users are urged to update immediately to block active zero-day attacks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A critical flaw in Chrome's V8 engine",
      "The newly patched vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-10585, stems from a type confusion weakness in Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered and reported the bug on Tuesday, and the company shipped a fix the following day, Bleeping Computer reported.",
      "Google confirmed that the flaw was being exploited in the wild, though it did not share technical details or name the groups behind the attacks. TAG has a history of uncovering zero-days tied to government-sponsored spyware campaigns aimed at high-risk individuals such as opposition leaders, journalists and dissidents.",
      "The fix was delivered through Chrome version 140.0.7339.185/.186 for Windows and macOS, and version 140.0.7339.185 for Linux. These updates will gradually reach all users in the Stable Desktop channel over the coming weeks.",
      "While Chrome typically updates automatically, you can apply the patch immediately by navigating to the \u2018About Google Chrome\u2019 section.

      "Then in June, another flaw in the V8 engine, CVE-2025-5419, was patched after being spotted by TAG. July saw the release of a fix for CVE-2025-6558, which allowed attackers to bypass Chrome's sandbox protection.

      "Many zero-day attacks are delivered through malicious websites or email attachments. Avoid clicking unknown links or downloading files from unverified sources, especially if they prompt you to disable security settings. Also, use strong antivirus software to add another layer of defense to detect malicious code that tries to run through compromised browsers. A strong antivirus can spot suspicious activity before it takes hold. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Even if attackers manage to steal your login details through a browser exploit,\u00a02FA makes it much harder for them to break into your accounts. Use an authenticator app instead of SMS when possible for stronger protection.",
      "If attackers exploit the browser to steal login data, a password manager keeps your credentials safe and helps generate unique, complex passwords. Even if one account is targeted, it prevents a domino effect across your logins.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Some extensions can be abused to make attacks worse. Stick to extensions from trusted developers, review permissions carefully and uninstall anything you no longer need.",
      "Chrome updates are critical, but attackers can also exploit holes in Windows, macOS, Android or iOS. Regular OS updates patch vulnerabilities across the system, reducing the chances of a browser exploit spreading further.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The fact that Chrome has already faced six zero-day attacks this year shows how relentless attackers are and how even the most popular software can have serious gaps. These flaws are not just bugs, but opportunities for hackers to exploit millions of users before fixes roll out. The pattern also highlights the growing sophistication of threat actors, including state-backed groups targeting high-risk individuals. No browser is completely safe, and the battle to secure widely used software is ongoing and far from over.",

      "Fox News Digital spoke with Cornell law professor William Jacobson, founder of the Equal Protection Project, following the two-year remembrance of the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel.",
      "Two years after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack on Israel, antisemitic \"venom\" infecting America\u2019s colleges hasn\u2019t faded \u2013 it\u2019s evolved, a professor said.",
      "The protests may have quieted, but \"venomous\" hatred has gone underground, and it\u2019s spreading through classrooms, faculty lounges, and student groups, William Jacobson, a Clinical Professor of Law at Cornell Law School, said.",
      "He says universities have learned to\u00a0mask the problem, cracking down on encampments and visible disruptions while the ideology driving the hate has only hardened.",
      "\"There has been a gross campaign at the international level to demonize Israel,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"False accusations of genocide. These are all percolating under the surface on the campuses. In some ways, the situation\u2019s worse underneath.\"",

      "He argues that the same ideas that fueled the pro-Hamas protests of 2023 have now been absorbed into campus culture, where they are \"more organized, more coordinated, and more dangerous\" than before.",
      "\"People should not be complacent that these issues were brewing before October 7th,\" he warned. \"They\u2019ve been pushed now back below the surface, but it\u2019s still brewing on campuses and nobody should kid themselves.\"",
      "He also accused elite universities of\u00a0stalling the federal crackdown on campus antisemitism, saying they are \"playing hide-and-seek\" with the Department of Education's investigations, and are betting they can simply outlast them.",
      "\"I think the schools think they can outlast the Trump administration,\" said Jacobson. \"That they can rope-a-dope it for two to three more years. And then perhaps they'll be rescued by a new administration.\"",
      "He said many top universities care less about donor backlash and more about protecting the billions in federal funding that keep them afloat.",
      "\"They take a longer-term view. They think this is going to blow over,\" he said. \"For every alum who withholds a contribution because of anti-Israelism on campus, there's probably another, probably a foreign donor, who makes up for it.\"",
      "\"What they do care about is federal funding, because federal funding is on a scale that so far surpasses private donations that it's something they can't ignore,\" he continued. \"If Trump ends up prevailing in a lot of these lawsuits, and I believe he will, that\u2019s going to put certain schools in a very bad situation.\"",
      "At Harvard University, federal officials have recently renewed efforts to limit the school\u2019s eligibility for certain research grants and new government contracts, according to a recent Fox News Digital report. The Trump administration has argued that universities found to have violated anti-discrimination laws should not receive federal funding.",
      "He likened far-left universities to\u00a0\"people clinging to a lifeboat after their ship was just sunk,\"\u00a0waiting for a change in political tides.",
      "\"They're hanging on to the lifeboat waiting for help to arrive,\" he said. \"They will probably think we\u2019ve been here before, and we'll ride this one out.\"",

      "\"People were marching, calling for an Intifada. People were marching, celebrating October 7th,\" he said. \"Let\u2019s not forget, in many ways, the most important day for campuses was not October 7th \u2013 it was October 8th.\"",
      "That next day, he said, some faculty members began\u00a0openly excusing Hamas\u2019 actions as part of \"decolonization.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s when [the] faculty started to make excuses for what Hamas and the Palestinians had done,\" he said. \"There was open sympathy for it. There was talk about, well, what did you think decolonization really means? It\u2019s not just class papers \u2014 it\u2019s a revolution.\"",
      "He pointed to examples at Harvard University and Cornell University, where one professor admitted he felt \"exhilarated\" after the attack before later walking the comment back.",
      "\"That nastiness that was there on October 7th and 8th is still there,\" he said. \"But it\u2019s in some ways even worse because there are organized attempts to spread that sort of venom throughout the campuses.\"",

      "Blair concluded, \"The\u00a0right to life, guaranteed under Section 33 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution, is meaningless unless the state acts decisively to punish those who violate it.

    "story": [
      "The US withdrawal from Iraq poses a serious threat of a power vacuum as Iran has drastically expanded its operations across Syria and Iraq.",
      "Just six months after the Trump administration said it would begin drawing down U.S. forces in Syria, the U.S. confirmed this week it will also begin reducing the number of U.S. forces in Iraq under an agreement reached by the Biden administration \u2013 a move security experts warn could benefit Iran and its \"shadow empire.\"",
      "The changes come amid a perceived reduction in threat from the terrorist network ISIS and a growing U.S. desire to end \"forever wars.\"",
      "But a reduced U.S. presence in both Iraq and Syria has security experts deeply concerned about the power vacuum it will create in both countries, and the immediate threat that Iran poses.",
      "US \u2018UPS THE ANTE,\u2019 DESIGNATES IRAN-BACKED GROUPS IN IRAQ TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS",
      "Iran for decades has been expanding its influence in both Iraq and Syria, and it has established a complex and highly embedded presence in the region militarily, politically, economically and socially, making it difficult to divert or thwart its influence even amid a regime change in Syria.",

      "\"The relationship between Islamic Revolutionary Iran and Syria goes all the way back to the '80s. It's not something that just started with the advent of the Syrian civil war,\" Gregg Roman, Executive Director of the Middle East Forum, told Fox News Digital. \"They took 40 years of relations and eventually turned that into an enterprise.\"",
      "Iran has used Shia militant forces from not only Syria, but Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon, to construct a \"parallel military infrastructure\" in coordination with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) that has transformed Syria into an \"Iranian forward operating base.\"",
      "According to an investigative report compiled by the Middle East Forum, using on-the-ground sources embedded in Iranian military installations across Syria since 2018, Iran has not only constructed underground tunnels and weapons depots for its disposal. Tehran has embedded itself deeply into the everyday lives of Syrians through an integrated system that has blended military duties with civil programs.",
      "It\u2019s\u00a0command structure also transcends traditional nation-state borders by integrating Iranian, Lebanese and Iraqi commanders.",
      "While Iran now faces opposition in Syria following the collapse of the Bashar al-Assad regime with the December 2024 takeover by the Sunni paramilitary organization Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham\u00a0(HST) \u2013 once deemed by the U.S. as a terrorist organization deriving from al Qaeda \u2013 Tehran has the potential to take advantage of that of lack of a unified government across Syria, as well as an immensely complex geopolitical dynamic where Israel, Turkey and Russia are all vying for more influence in the nation.",

      "Roman pointed out that if HST, in coordination with the Kurds in the northeast or the Druze in the southwest, are not able to create a \"bulwark\" against Iranian influence, then Tehran could be well positioned to expand its regional interest under its \"shadow empire.\"",
      "\"Perhaps most concerning is the precedent established by Iran\u2019s success in constructing this shadow empire,\" the report found. \"The ability to build parallel military infrastructure, operate independently of host government control, and maintain strategic capabilities despite international scrutiny provides a template that could be replicated elsewhere in the region.\"",
      "Though its strategy may be slightly different, Iran has repeatedly used power vacuums to extend its reach and counter U.S. influence, as seen in both Afghanistan, where it backed the Taliban, and in Iraq, where it began backing Shia militia groups fighting the U.S. as early as 2003.",
      "\"The Iranians have a strategy in Iraq, and it's effective,\" Bill Roggio, expert terrorism analyst and senior editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 \"Long War Journal,\" told Fox News Digital. \"They're using military, political and economic means to achieve their goals, and their proximity to Iraq really helps them achieve that.\"",
      "Roggio said there are hundreds of thousands of Iran-backed militants in Iraq who are largely a part of the Popular Mobilization Forces, which were heavily influential in fighting ISIS and are a part of the Iraqi Armed Forces under the command of the prime minister, but which are also heavily influenced by Tehran.",

      "\"They wield significant influence in the Iraqi government. They occupy a large, dominant block in the Iraqi parliament. And these militias also have economic power,\" Roggio said. \"Iran built these militia forces along the same lines as Hezbollah, and they essentially want them to ultimately become like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is in Iran.\"",
      "Both Roman and Roggio expressed concern over the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region and, more significantly, the removal of U.S. influence at a time when Iran is looking to heavily counter Washington and its interests.",
      "\"We haven't learned the lessons of Afghanistan and even the lessons of Iraq,\" Roggio said. \"I don't care if we have 100 or 100,000 troops in Afghanistan or anywhere else. Do we have the right troops to achieve the mission that we put out for them?",
      "\"We talk about numbers of troops. \u2026 We're not really talking about what is our mission in Iraq? Is it a counter-ISIS mission? Is it a stave off Iranian influence mission?",

We operate in timeframes and two and four-year election cycles,\" Roggio said. \"Ultimately, Iran is looking to drive the U.S. from the region and expand its influence in neighboring countries, be it Afghanistan, be it Iraq, be it the Gulf states.",

    "summary": "As Trump clashes with Democratic governors, several former Republican governors are raising concerns about strong-arm tactics and constitutional crises.",
    "story": [
      "As President Donald Trump clashes with Democratic governors over his push to deploy federalized National Guard troops to their cities, several former Republican governors are raising concerns about strong-arm tactics and constitutional crises \u2014 while also noting that the president has wide latitude to deploy the guard.",
      "The three former governors, who have long histories of criticizing Trump, also expressed a sense of resignation, saying they believe he will charge ahead unless the courts rein him in.",
      "\u201cThis is infuriating,\u201d former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who left the Republican Party in 2022 after years of opposing Trump and endorsing his opponents, said in an interview. \u201cIt is stoking resentment and fanning the flames. But as a governor there is nothing you can do to really stop the president from federalizing the guard.\u201d",
      "Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich expressed concern with the communication between the Trump administration and state and local officials.",
      "\u201cI would say: \u2018Here are my problems. What can you do to help me? Work with me. Don\u2019t just shove stuff down my throat,\u2019\u201d said Kasich, a Republican who ran against Trump in the 2016 GOP presidential primaries and has since been a prominent anti-Trump voice in the party.",
      "While these former governors are critics, their perspectives as former chief executives of their states are instructive when active Republicans dealing with the White House and its political objectives on a daily basis are less inclined to publicly scrutinize Trump.",
      "Sitting GOP governors were less eager to weigh in on the matter, which could escalate if Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, a step he said he would consider if resistance from mayors, governors and courts makes it \u201cnecessary.\u201d Roughly a dozen GOP governors, through their spokespeople, either declined or have not yet responded to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cUninformed criticisms from irrelevant former politicians shouldn\u2019t be given the time of day,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an emailed statement. \u201cPresident Trump is lawfully taking action to protect federal officers and assets amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness that Democrat leaders, like [Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom] have refused to quell. Why aren\u2019t these washed up nobodies concerned with Democrat inaction to address violent crime and riots?\u201d",
      "The political fallout is falling largely along partisan lines.",
      "The White House has cast Trump\u2019s desire to send troops into Democratic-run cities and states as an effort to curb crime and protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and facilities that administration officials say are being targeted by rioters. Trump most recently has called for deploying federalized guard members to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, drawing pushback and lawsuits from the Democratic governors in those states.",
      "A Trump ally, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, is on record embracing the administration\u2019s efforts, writing Sunday on X that he had \u201cfully authorized\u201d Trump to deploy 400 Texas National Guard members to other states. And Trump\u2019s push to mobilize the National Guard and other federal law enforcement agencies in Memphis, Tennessee, has met with support there from Republican Gov. Bill Lee.",
      "\u201cYou can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let [the] Texas Guard do it,\u201d Abbott wrote in his social media post. \u201cNo Guard can match the training, skill, and expertise of the Texas National Guard.\u201d",
      "Peter Finocchio, a spokesperson for Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, did not specifically address the recent developments in Oregon and Illinois but described the governor's administration as supportive of Trump's goals. Finocchio noted the Virginia National Guard's mobilization last month of about 40 soldiers and airmen to \u201cprovide administrative and logistics support to ICE at locations across the Commonwealth.\u201d",
      "The mission, Finocchio added, is expected to continue through Nov. 15.",
      "At a news conference Monday, Pritzker suggested that Trump was trying to sow unrest so he can invoke the Insurrection Act. The measure \u2014 which allows the president to mobilize the U.S. military to conduct civilian law enforcement activities under certain circumstances \u2014 was last used during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is following a playbook: Cause chaos, create fear and confusion, make it seem like peaceful protesters are a mob by firing gas pellets and tear gas canisters at them,\u201d Pritzker said.",
      "Pritzker also threatened this week to withdraw from the National Governors Association if the nonpartisan group does not take a stand against Trump's National Guard moves.",
      "Illinois sued Monday to block the Trump administration from deploying troops to Chicago. A judge declined to immediately block the administration\u2019s move and instead scheduled a hearing for Thursday.",
      "Earlier, a federal judge in Oregon had blocked the Trump administration from deploying federalized National Guard members from California or other states to Portland\u2019s streets. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, had also blocked the administration from deploying Oregon National Guard troops in Portland.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a real constitutional dilemma that is unprecedented and it will have to be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who briefly challenged Trump for last year\u2019s Republican presidential nomination.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for the courts to step in and say, \u2018We\u2019re going to override the executive branch,\u2019\u201d added Hutchinson, a former U.S. attorney who stressed that he was offering more analysis than personal opinion.",
      "Hutchinson noted that he approved the deployment of Arkansas National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to protect federal assets in late January 2021, after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and before the inauguration. He also noted that in 1957, President Dwight Eisenhower deployed the 101st Airborne Division to Arkansas to enforce integration at Little Rock Central High School over the objections of then-Gov. Orval Faubus, who had mobilized the state national guard to stop Black students from entering the school.",
      "\u201cHe was enforcing federal law as interpreted by the courts,\u201d Hutchinson said of Eisenhower. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of latitude given to the president.\u201d",
      "Whitman, who also was President George W. Bush\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency administrator, suggested that governors could try to wrestle the bully pulpit away from Trump.",
      "\u201cThere is going to be crime in cities and small towns,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, it happens when humans get together, but that\u2019s vastly different than cities burning down. I remember the \u201960s when the cities were burning. That is not happening. We have mostly peaceful protests outside ICE offices. ... If you are a governor, go walk the streets and take the press. There are periods where you will have drug users and homeless, and you need to be up front about that. You have to show what is and is not true, use visuals.\u201d",
      "Kasich, who said he was upset about a recent aggressive ICE operation involving a helicopter at a Chicago apartment complex, urged more pragmatic discussions about crime and immigration. Kasich marveled at the success that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, has had in courting the president on initiatives important to her state. Whitmer, like Pritzker and California's Newsom, another Democrat opposed to Trump\u2019s deployments, is seen as a potential White House contender in 2028.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s running for president, but I can\u2019t blame it all on them, either,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much communication coming the other way,\u201d from the Trump administration to the governors.",
      "Whitman was blunter when assessing the partisan politics, asserting that Trump is \u201cabsolutely\u201d targeting Democratic states.",
      "\u201cAnd what I want to say to Republicans who voted for him in those states,\u201d Whitman added, \u201cis, \u2018How is that working out for you? Are you happy?\u2019\u201d"

    "summary": "The Supreme Court considers a free speech challenge to a Colorado law that bans conversion therapy aimed at young LGBTQ people.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court appeared poised Tuesday to back a free speech challenge to a Colorado law that bans conversion therapy aimed at young people questioning their sexual orientations or gender identities in a case likely to have national implications.",
      "A ruling against the state could affect more than 20 states that have similar bans and raise new questions about other long-standing state health care regulations.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority that often backs conservative free speech claims, heard oral argument in a case brought by Kaley Chiles, a Christian therapist, who says the 2019 law violates her free speech rights under the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment.",
      "Conversion therapy, favored by some religious conservatives, seeks to encourage gay or lesbian minors to identify as heterosexual and transgender children to identify as the gender identities assigned to them at birth. Colorado bans the practice for licensed therapists, not for religious entities or family members.",
      "The practice is widely discredited by medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Conversion therapy is ineffective, research has found, and can even be harmful, increasing risk of suicide among people subjected to it.",
      "At issue in the case is whether such bans regulate conduct in the same way as regulations applying to health care providers, as Colorado argues, or speech, as Chiles contends. Chiles says she does only talk therapy.",
      "Based on the questions asked during oral argument, a Supreme Court majority is likely to conclude that Colorado is trying to regulate speech in a way that favors one viewpoint over another.",
      "Drawing a distinction between speech that encourages minors to embrace their gender identities or sexual orientations while prohibiting them from questioning it \"looks like blatant viewpoint discrimination,\" conservative Justice Samuel Alito said.",
      "Justices seemed skeptical of the state's argument that the speech in question is tied to the kind of conduct that medical regulators often impose restrictions on.",
      "\"Just because they are engaged in conduct doesn't mean their words aren't protected,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said.",
      "He and other justices pointed to a 2018 Supreme Court ruling in which the conservative majority backed a free speech challenge to a California law that requires anti-abortion pregnancy centers to notify clients about where abortion services can be obtained.",
      "The court's liberal justices asked more probing questions of Chiles' lawyer, but, of the three, only Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson seemed to fully embrace the state's arguments in favor of the ban.",
      "She brought up the Supreme Court's ruling this year that states could ban gender transition care for minors in a case involving a Tennessee law. She questioned why the court would give states deference in one scenario but not the other.",
      "\"It just seems odd to me that we might have a different result here,\" she said.",
      "A recurring question that was raised is whether a ruling against Colorado would also limit the potential for conservative states to enact what conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch called \"mirror-image\" laws that would ban therapy that encourages youths to embrace their gender identities or sexual orientations.",
      "\"Can a state pick a side?\" Justice Amy Coney Barrett, another conservative, asked.",
      "Hashim Mooppan, representing the Trump administration in support of the challengers, said the First Amendment would bar both types of laws.",
      "Referring to the ruling earlier this year, he said that under Colorado's legal theory, Tennessee could have banned gender-affirming talk therapy, as well as treatments like puberty blockers and hormones that were at issue in that case.",
      "\"We think that's a strong reason to support our position,\" Mooppan said.",
      "The Supreme Court has, in major cases, backed LGBTQ rights, legalizing same-sex marriage in 2015 and ruling five years later that a federal law barring employment discrimination applies to both gay and transgender people.",
      "But in another line of cases, the court has backed free speech and religious expression rights when they conflict with anti-discrimination laws aimed at protecting LGBTQ people.",
      "The court backed a religious rights challenge this year to a Maryland school district's policy of featuring LGBTQ-themed books in elementary schools.",
      "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, said in court papers that a ruling against the state would imperil not just conversion therapy bans but also other health care treatments that experts say are unsafe or ineffective.",
      "Chiles, represented by the conservative Christian group Alliance Defending Freedom, countered in her court papers that therapy is \"vital speech that helps young people better understand themselves.\"",
      "The state is seeking to \"control what those kids believe about themselves and who they can become,\" the lawyers said.",
      "After the oral argument, Chiles said outside the court that if not for the ban, she would have clients seeking counseling for gender identity or sexual orientation.",
      "\"There are numerous adolescents and their families who have the goals that Colorado says are not allowed, and we are hopeful that in the future, we will be able to have a therapeutic relationship back,\u201d she said.",
      "The court might not issue a definitive ruling on conversion therapy bans; it could focus more narrowly on whether lower courts that upheld the ban conducted the correct legal analysis.",
      "If the law infringes on speech, it must be given a closer look under the First Amendment, a form of review known as \"strict scrutiny,\" which the justices could ask lower courts to do instead of doing it themselves. Under that approach, judges consider whether a government action that infringes on free speech serves a compelling interest and was \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to meet that goal.",
      "The Trump administration filed a brief urging the court to find that the law does burden speech while also saying a ruling in favor of Chiles would not upend state regulations in other areas."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/higher-health-insurance-premiums-affordable-care-act-employer-rcna235925",
    "published": "Tue, 07 Oct 2025 18:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts say there\u2019s no single, across-the-board increase, but increases are likely for many people on employer-sponsored health insurance plans next year.",
    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re among the roughly 165 million Americans who get your health coverage through work, not the government, you might be wondering: Is my plan next, now that health insurance premiums for Affordable Care Act plans are set to rise next year?",
      "Experts say there\u2019s no single, across-the-board increase, but increases are likely for many people on employer-sponsored plans. And even if your monthly premium stays the same, you could still end up paying more through higher deductibles or copays.",
      "\u201cLast year, health insurance premiums went up. This year, they went up. And next year, they\u2019ll go up,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Schulman, a professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine who researches employer-based health insurance.",
      "Have you gotten a notice about health insurance premium hikes for next year? Whether you receive benefits from the Affordable Care Act or private insurance from your employer, we\u2019d like to hear from you. Please contact us at tips@nbcuni.com or reach out to us here.",
      "So, how much could your plan go up?",
      "Unlike ACA plans, in which insurers publicly file proposed rate increases with states and federal regulators, employers often negotiate plans with insurers privately, said Gary Claxton, director of the Program on the Health Care Marketplace at KFF, a health policy research group. That means your premium increase might not be apparent until open enrollment.",
      "Even so, recent employer surveys shed some light on what companies expect to pay next year \u2014 though they may not pass the entire increase onto the employee.",
      "A September report from the benefits consulting firm Mercer found employers say health care plan costs could rise by nearly 9% on average in 2026 if they don\u2019t take action to control costs. The survey was based on more than 1,700 U.S. employers. Another report from the consulting firm Aon projects employer health care costs will climb 9.5% next year, based on data from more than 1,000 U.S. companies. HR consulting firm Segal estimates a 9% increase for health plans and 11% for prescription drugs.",
      "Claxton said some employers will decide to pass some of the additional costs onto employees through premiums. The Mercer report, for example, said the average cost of coverage per employee is expected to be 6% to 7% \u2014 the biggest increase in more than a decade \u2014 a jump that will likely show up in workers\u2019 premiums.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re seeing a big increase of 6.5%, it\u2019s likely that the employee contribution, the employee share of the premium, is going to go up by the same amount,\u201d said Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer.",
      "Other companies, however, may keep premiums steady, but raise deductibles or copays, Claxton said.",
      "Others, in a competitive labor market, might absorb the entire cost increase themselves.",
      "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s better to eat that cost as opposed to upsetting your employees, particularly if it\u2019ll mean that some of them will leave,\u201d Claxton said. \u201cIt\u2019s often more expensive to recruit new workers.\u201d",
      "It also depends on how big the company is and whether its employees are healthy enough for it to take on the financial risk.",
      "\u201cIf you have a really young workforce, your premiums are going to be lower,\u201d Claxton said. \u201cIf you have an older workforce, they\u2019re going to be higher. If you\u2019re an employer with only a few hundred employees, if you get a couple really sick people, you can see a big increase from year to year, particularly if that sickness is going to persist.\u201d",
      "Schulman said some companies may try to control costs instead by limiting which doctors and hospitals employees can use, also called \u201cnarrow network.\u201d",
      "Still, he said, the premium increases have been a growing trend: Health insurance costs as a percentage of median family household income have increased from 13% to 25% from 2000 to 2021.",
      "\u201cThese are enormous increases in health insurance premiums, Schulman said.",
      "Why is insurance getting more expensive?",
      "In the reports from Mercer and Aon, employers cited many of the same cost pressures that are driving up ACA premiums, including rising hospital costs and pricey prescription drugs, like GLP-1s, and a growing number of people seeking care \u2014 thanks in part to convenient options like telehealth that are making it easier for people to get help.",
      "JoAnn Volk, a research professor and co-director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, said the increases are largely due to rising health care costs.",
      "Georgetown\u2019s McCourt School of Public Policy sent a memo last month to Democratic senators who requested information about the proposed rate increases under ACA plans. Volk said many forces cited hitting ACA plans \u2014 including higher prices, more use of services and inflation \u2014 are hitting employer plans, too.",
      "What\u2019s more, people are spending more. Health care spending jumped about 8.2% in 2024 and is projected to grow another 7.1% this year, outpacing spending across the broader economy, according to a June study published in Health Affairs. Health spending may slow slightly in 2026 as fewer people are expected to have health insurance, but costs will likely keep rising faster than the overall economy.",
      "Some employers could raise premiums next year, while others may have already locked in rates and won\u2019t adjust them, Volk said.",
      "In the coming year, they may also factor in new employees who previously had coverage through the ACA marketplace or another individual plan.",
      "\u201cSome employers start on a fiscal year, which might be summer of next year, and they would be more likely to say, \u2018We have some sense now of who\u2019s coming back into the employer plan, then the prices may adjust to reflect that,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "The latest season of \u201cMonster\u201d tells the story of Ed Gein, a Wisconsin man who killed at least one person and dug up bodies from a cemetery. But there are some killers so vile, the creators of the show say they won\u2019t make a season about them.",
      "Ian Brennan, one of the creators of Netflix\u2019s \u201cMonster\u201d series, told TODAY.com during the \u201cMonster: The Ed Gein Story\u201d red carpet premiere that murderers like Ted Bundy will never get the \u201cMonster\u201d treatment.",
      "\u201cTed Bundy is just a monster. It\u2019s just about sadism and sexual violence. We just don\u2019t find that interesting,\u201d Brennan says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, not only is that hard to watch, that\u2019s like hard to write. Like, I just don\u2019t, there\u2019s not a mind there that you want to get inside, or even to get inside.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a deep banality to most evil, really, and that\u2019s why someone like Ed (Gein) is so interesting,\u201d he added. \u201cI hesitate to even call him evil, that\u2019s like the wrong vocabulary to even describe him. He was just so deeply strange.\u201d",
      "Brennan said he and Ryan Murphy, the co-creator of \u201cMonster,\u201d try to find stories that are multi-dimensional for the series.",
      "\u201cRather than recoil, you just sort of want to lean in,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cAnd whenever we get to a place where we\u2019re leaning in on something, even as as macabre and dark and strange and upsetting as the Ed Gein story, you know you\u2019re on to something.\u201d",
      "Brennan described Gein as \"a very, very fascinating person\" who \"contains multitudes.\"",
      "\"A big part of this series is starting seasons and abandoning them, because you never know quite know what's gonna feel right. Sometimes we start writing and it's like, 'Eugh,' particularly when you're dealing with murder,\" he said. \"Most murders, most murderers are not interesting. They're just tragic and awful and violent and sadistic. So it takes like, an interesting curveball that can sort of get past all those criticisms internally and be something you want to spend eight hours with.\"",
      "Brennan previously said in an interview with Variety published on Sept. 30 that serial killers like the Golden State Killer and John Wayne Gacy have \"nothing redemptive\" in their stories.",
      "\u201cThe second the name comes up for us, every year, both of us go, No. There\u2019s no pathos,\u201d Brennan said of Gacy.",
      "As for Bundy, Murphy told Variety: \u201cWhen you look at those crimes, what are the themes there? It doesn\u2019t ask you any questions about society. It feels too murderous \u2014 not interesting enough.\u201d",
      "While there may never be a full season about Bundy, the serial killer does make an appearance in \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story.\" Here's what to know about the fictional connection between Ed Gein and Ted Bundy.",
      "Did Ed Gein Help Find Ted Bundy?",
      "In the last episode of \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\" Gein, played by Charlie Hunnam, appears to help authorities find Bundy, though it also could be a figment of his own imagination as he thinks through the killers he could have influenced after he inspired movies like \"Psycho.\"",
      "In real life, Gein had no connection to Bundy's arrest.",
      "Gein was arrested in 1957 after investigators found the body of Bernice Worden, a local hardware store owner, hanging by the heels on his property, according to the Associated Press.",
      "When investigators went inside Gein's home, they found a house of horrors, including severed body parts, furniture made of human skin and more, according to the AP.",
      "After his arrest, Gein admitted to killing two people and digging up the graves of several women in interviews with investigators, according to a transcript of the interviews included in the book, \u201cThe Ed Gein File\u201d compiled by John Borowski.",
      "Gein was sent to a psychiatric hospital after his arrest, and in 1968, a judge found him guilty of murder, though the same judge later ruled Gein was insane at the time of the crime and sent him back to the facility, according to the Associated Press.",
      "In 1978, Gein was transferred to the Mendota Mental Health Institute, where he would remain until his death in 1984, meaning he was in the hospital when Bundy committed his crimes and was unable to help authorities with Bundy's arrest.",
      "Bundy was convicted of killing three people, though he confessed to killing more than two dozen women and girls, and he's suspected in the murderers of even more, according to the FBI.",
      "A Pensacola, Florida, police officer initiated a traffic stop on Feb. 15, 1978, after he noticed an orange Volkswagen Beetle was stolen, according to the FBI. Bundy, inside the car, resisted arrest but was eventually taken into custody.",
      "The officer didn't know who Bundy was, but he was later identified, as he had been added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on Feb. 10, 1978, according to the FBI.",
      "After Bundy was convicted, he was sentenced to death and was executed by electric chair on Jan. 24, 1989."

    "story": [
      "Mayci Neeley of Hulu's \u201cThe Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" says in her new memoir that by age 20, she had been abused, drugged and raped by her ex-boyfriend. She moved on to a healthy relationship and accidentally became pregnant, she says, only to find out that her boyfriend was cheating on her.",
      "She started sending vicious text messages to him, she recalls, while he begged for forgiveness. His last text to her was a typo of a single letter: \"J.\"",
      "Just a few hours later, Neeley says, she was at lunch with her mom when she learned via Instagram that the father of her unborn child, was killed in a car crash. She says she realized that he might have died while texting her.",
      "\"I was severely depressed,\" Neeley says in a video interview with TODAY.com. \"I\u2019ve never felt like that my entire life. I kind of just felt like my life was over. I had nothing to look forward to.\"",
      "Though Neeley's life now may look practically perfect on \"Secret Lives\" and her popular social media accounts, she has, in fact, been hiding secrets of her own that she finally reveals in her new autobiography, \"Told You So.\"",
      "Neeley was a Division 1 tennis star at Brigham Young University. She says she managed to party as much as she played, partly to escape memories of her abuser. Finding a new boyfriend seemed to help her maintain stability ... until she learned that she was pregnant and that he had been unfaithful.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t want to become a mom that young. I was not ready. I\u2019ll just put it that way,\" she says.",
      "Once she gave birth to her son Hudson, however, her outlook shifted dramatically.",
      "\"Something just switched inside of me,\" she explains. \"Those feelings you feel when you have a baby are so magical that I just couldn't imagine life without him. He is what I was put on earth to do, even though I'm so young. I was like, 'This is my purpose.' He made my life make sense again.\"",
      "With the support of her family, Neeley says, she returned to college and her tennis team, and she began clinging more to her Mormon beliefs. She met and married Jacob Neeley in 2018. The couple is raising 10-year-old Hudson, as well as 4-year-old Harlow and baby Charli, born last July.",
      "Introducing Hudson to His \"Bio Dad\"",
      "On the advice of a therapist, Mayci and Jacob began telling Hudson about his biological father when he was around 4 years old.",
      "\"The day we told him, he was very casual because he was so young,\" she recalls. \"And then as he got older, it was such a normal part of his life that it was never a secret.\"",
      "Hudson's biological grandparents still spend time with their grandson. \"I invite them to Hudson's baseball games and stuff like that so he can hear about his bio dad from them,\" Neeley says.",
      "\"We've tried our best to keep it natural and casual, to where it's not a secret, but we're not putting pictures of his bio dad around the walls,\" she says.",
      "Reliving Past Trauma",
      "Because Neeley told her story to friends and relatives so many times in the last 10 years, she says she feels almost \"desensitized\" to her traumatic past. But writing everything down in book form was another story.",
      "\"I was doing a lot of it pregnant too,\" she says. \"Your emotions are a little more heightened. It wasn't easy process by any means.\"",
      "She remains extremely close to her parents: Her mother helped care for Hudson while Neeley finished college and her father inspired her to write this book.",
      "\"He was so mad learning more about the abuse I went through,\" Neeley said of her father reading her book. \"He's like, 'Why wouldn't you have told me?' I was like, 'Because I didn't want you to go to jail!'\"",
      "Though Neeley says she was often \"annoyed\" with her mother's endless positivity,  her mom was also her \"best friend\" throughout the process.",
      "\"Everything that we went through \u2014 me getting pregnant \u2014 especially for a Mormon was not ideal,\" Mayci says. \"My parents really were my rock during that time.\"",
      "\"They pushed me to know that just because you're pregnant doesn't mean you have to give up on your dreams,\" she says.",
      "Being Labeled a \"Pot Stirrer\"",
      "On Hulu's \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,\" Neeley often gets criticized for being \"a pot stirrer\" or \"riding the fence.\" But the comments don't concern her.",
      "\"I have a very thick skin,\" she says.",
      "\"I've been through so much that the drama, the he-said/she-said, doesn\u2019t matter. At the end of the day, there\u2019s a lot worse things going on, so I just don\u2019t like to insert myself in things that aren\u2019t specifically about me.\"",
      "In fact, Neeley is so diplomatic that she has been splitting her \"Dancing With the Stars\" votes 50/50 between her two \"Secret Lives\" castmates, Whitney Leavitt and Jennifer Affleck.",
      "\"I love both of them. I want them to both succeed,\" she says.",
      "And will she watch castmate Taylor Frankie Paul look for love as \"The Bachelorette\"?",
      "\"100%!\" she says excitedly. \"I will be throwing watch parties. I will be ready.\"",

      "Cillo worked for the city of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, for the duration of his 33-year career. \u201cRetirement did hit me. All of a sudden, after the same duties for 33 years now, I have all this free time on my hands, And I don\u2019t know if I necessarily liked it,\u201d he said.",
      "That\u2019s when he reached back to something he said he \u201cnever stopped thinking about\u201d: Football.",
      "Cillo said he fell in love with the game at 8, but as a teenager, fell into \u201ca crowd that may not have been the best for me\u201d and lost touch with the sport.",
      "Mike Clark, the head coach of Lycoming College\u2019s football team, recalled, in a taped segment for TODAY with Jenna & Friends, how Cillo became a Warrior. A trustee mentioned Cillo, a \"local guy\u201d and a \u201cwell liked super weight lifter\u201d who wanted to play football, to him.",
      "\u201cI was caught off guard a little bit especially when I found out he was 58 but the more we talked, I said, 'Look, give him my cell phone number. We\u2019ll meet and we\u2019ll talk about how we can maybe make this work,'\u201d Clark said.",
      "Clark took a chance on Cillo. \u201cIf he looked like the 58 year old version of me, I probably wouldn\u2019t let him played, right? But the guy\u2019s legitimately strong,\u201d he said.",

      "Steve Weinster, associate head coach, said everyone was \u201con the sideline cheering\u201d when Cillo played during a Sunday game.",

      "\u201cDeveloping the guys on our team and helping them become not just better players and hopefully winning games, but helping them become better men and achieve the goals that they want to achieve,\u201d he said.",
      "Cillo said he\u2019s fallen in love with the sport again. \u201cThe same thing in football that appealed to me as a child still appeals to me to this day. I still feel like it is the greatest sport in the world. And just to be out on that field going through the grind every day with a group of guys with a common goal, it\u2019s a special time for me. It really is. I\u2019m enjoying every day of it,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking to Cillo on TODAY with Jenna and Friends on Oct. 7, Willie asked Cillo what it was like to jog on the field for the first time.",
      "\u201cIt was everything I thought it would be and maybe more honestly,\u201d Cillo said. \u201cSomebody that has always had this spirit of competition to them, and I just love to compete.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect when I came in and how players would treat me. My mindset was, \u2018I\u2019m going to earn their respect in the weight room, in the conditioning, on the football field.\u2019 Our relationship has grown and grown. It\u2019s getting better all the time,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cI was probably more nervous about that than the football part of it \u2014\u00a041 years away from the classroom. But I have adapted rather quickly and actually doing quite well,\u201d Cillo told Jenna.",
      "Jenna and Willie surprised Cillo, a Raiders fan, with tickets to the upcoming Raiders v. Eagles match, plus a swag bag.",
      "This wouldn\u2019t be the first time he attended a Philadelphia game in Raiders gear. \u201cI actually did that in the 1980s when Bo Jackson was coming from baseball to football and it was very educational,\u201d Cillo laughed."

    "summary": "Did Ed Gein inspire \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and other horror movies? Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Director Tobe Hooper terrified audiences in 1974 with \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" featuring an iconic horror movie villain who wears a mask made out of his victims' skin.",
      "While the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface is a fictional creation, aspects of his character borrow from the real story of Ed Gein \u2014 which is why the horror character makes an appearance in the finale of \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story.\"",
      "Nearly 20 years before \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" drew screams from theater goers, Gein made headlines for a pair of grisly murders and a collection of chilling human artifacts at his farm in Wisconsin.",
      "Gein is portrayed by actor Charlie Hunnam in the new Netflix series \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\" which began streaming on Oct. 3. Gein's influence on the horror and suspense genres has been profound, from films in the 1960s to the present day.",
      "Here is how Gein is connected to \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\" which has spawned eight sequels as well as comics and video games.",
      "Who was Ed Gein?",
      "Raised with his older brother on an isolated Wisconsin farm by his domineering mother and abusive father, Gein became infamous for a pair of murders and other crimes discovered by local authorities in 1957.",
      "Gein confessed to killing two local woman after the corpse of one of them was found decapitated on his property. He also told authorities he exhumed the bodies of several women from a local cemetery.",
      "A 1957 report issued by Central State Hospital in Wisconsin said an investigation of his home \"revealed several so-called human masks, the use of human skin as upholstery material for a chair and other remains of human anatomy.\"",
      "Gein spent the rest of his live in mental institutions after his arrest in 1957 and died at 77 in 1984.",
      "How did Ed Gein Influence 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"?",
      "The fictional plot line of \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" has to do with a group of teens who are attacked by a ghoulish family of cannibals at a rural home in Texas after their van runs out of gas and they go looking for help.",
      "While that part does not mirror Gein's story, the character of Leatherface, who was played by Gunnar Hansen in the original film, is inspired by Gein's crimes. Hooper was aware of the story when he made the film.",
      "\"I had relatives from Wisconsin and they would pay us a visit when I was about four or five years old,\" Hooper told The Flashback Files in 2015. \"They told us the story about this man who lived in the next town from them, about 27 miles or so, who was digging up graves and using the bones and skin in his house. That was all I knew about it. They didn\u2019t mention his name. But to me he was like a real boogeyman.\"",
      "Leatherface, a mentally disabled man child, wears the papery skin of his victims as a mask on his own face in the films. Authorities who searched Gein's Wisconsin home in 1957 found masks made out of women's skin. He denied any accusations of cannibalism, which differs from the family in \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\"",
      "Gein told police that he disinterred bodies of women from the Plainfield Cemetery near his home in Wisconsin, according to official reports in the book \"The Ed Gein File\" produced by John Borowski. Gein stripped the skin from the skulls, but told interviewers he has no memory of his crimes.",
      "In \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and its sequels, Leatherface can be seen hanging his victims on hooks like a butcher readying to eviscerate a pig. When the body of one of Gein's victims, Bernice Worden, was found on his property in 1957, her corpse was decapitated and hung upside down like livestock at a slaughterhouse, according to police and news reports.",
      "The family's home in the horror movie also has furniture made from the bones of humans and animals. Human remains turned into lampshades and other furniture were found in Gein's home.",
      "Also, the deranged family in the movies lives in a foreboding home in a remote wilderness in Texas. Gein also lived in isolation on a farm in Plainfield, Wisconsin.",
      "A notable difference is that there was no evidence Gein used a chainsaw to murder or dismember his victims, whereas it's an integral part of what makes Leatherface so terrifying. Gein's two known victims were killed by gunshot.",
      "\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" isn't the only iconic horror movie to draw from Gein's story. His overall cultural impact is examined in \"Monster.\"",
      "\u201cHe was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u2018Psycho,\u2019 Buffalo Bill in \u2018Silence of the Lambs\u2019 and \u2018Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\u2019 so he had this huge cultural influence,\u201d Charlie Hunnam, who plays Gein in \"Monster,\" told TODAY on Sept. 30. \u201cWe sort of go back and look at the inspiration behind the inspiration for those films.\u201d"

      "\u201cWhen I told them, \u2018Hey, Mom and Dad, I\u2019m going on this show, they\u2019re going to take my phone, they were like, \u2018Are you being kidnapped?\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "When it came time to decide if she was going to leave or not, Anna said she was very emotional and worried that she'd taken the spot of someone else who may have continued on with the experiment.",
      "\u201cI was a wreck,\u201d she said. \u201cMy eyes were almost swollen shut from crying. I was embarrassed.\u201d",
      "In her emotional state, Anna opted not to go on camera again and tell Patrick she was leaving. She did feel guilty, but said she has made peace with how things panned out.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I regret it because I don\u2019t think the connections were strong enough to have a successful marriage from there,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Despite being headlined by a genuine star and staged at one of London\u2019s premier theaters, a play about the foundation of a sprawling and troubled public service seemed unlikely to provoke night after night of standing ovations.",
      "But that\u2019s what happened with \u201cNye,\u201d an unlikely hit about the creator, and origin story, of Britain\u2019s taxpayer-funded National Health Service.",
      "The play, written by Tim Price and directed by Rufus Norris, came at an inflection point for the NHS, as it\u2019s known. Almost 80 years after it was founded, the medical service once touted as the envy of the world is \u201cbroken\u201d and suffering the \u201cbiggest crisis in its history,\u201d the government says. The crisis at this national bedrock is part of a bigger malaise at the heart of British culture: rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m terrified, not just for the NHS, but for the whole of our society,\u201d Michael Sheen, who starred as Aneurin \u201cNye\u201d Bevan, the founder of the NHS, told NBC News in an interview. \u201cOnce it\u2019s torn down, then I guess people will think about what they\u2019ve lost.\u201d",
      "Sheen, 56, better known to international audiences as Tony Blair in \u201cThe Queen,\u201d David Frost in \u201cFrost/Nixon\u201d and the angel Aziraphale in the Amazon Prime series \u201cGood Omens,\u201d has spent much of the last two years honing his portrayal of Bevan, the socialist politician who dragged himself out of Wales\u2019 coal mines to will the NHS into existence.",
      "Though second nature to Brits, the ideal of the NHS is unfamiliar to many Americans: British people have universally free health care at the point of access \u2014 from ambulances attending car accidents to insulin for diabetes to cancer care to childbirth. Though some people do have private insurance, the idea of having to choose between illness and financial ruin is shocking in the U.K.",
      "Now, the Labour Party, which created the then-radical NHS in 1948, is battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity. It has a colossal task if it is to fix the crumbling hospitals replete with overworked doctors and bed-lined corridors.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer must turn around a behemoth whose budget of 200 billion English pounds ($269 billion) represents some 40% of all government spending, and whose 1.4 million employees are the world\u2019s seventh-largest workforce. In the United States, only the Department of Defense, Walmart and Amazon employ more people.",
      "Through all this, the core NHS ideal endures. Everyone in the U.K. has a story of a relative, or themselves, receiving the type of world-class care that puts a terrifying financial strain on millions of Americans. (In the past six years, this reporter\u2019s mother has had a single mastectomy and reconstruction, as well as three titanium plates in a shattered ankle, without having to pay a pound for the care.)",
      "But just as common are the tales of maddening, hourslong waits in overstretched emergency rooms, or weeklong delays just to see a community general practitioner. Many critics blame the sprawling crisis on years of underfunding by the now-ousted Conservative government of 2010-24, whose response to the 2008 financial crisis was to make drastic cuts to public services.",
      "It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that a largely liberal London-theatergoing audience responded with applause and tears at the hagiography of Bevan at the National Theater. Though relatively unknown in wider society, admirers see Bevan as a founding father of modern Britain; his ideal of the NHS today is not just popular, it defines the country itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far from perfect,\u201d said Alison Ferris, 40, a nurse at a hospital in Canterbury, in southeast England. \u201cBut I do the best that I can for anyone that comes in front of me. I treat every patient like I would treat my loved ones.\u201d",
      "Though the concept remains revered, public satisfaction in the NHS in practice cratered to 52% in 2023 from a high of 70% in 2010, according to the King\u2019s Fund, a top think tank tracking British health care.",
      "\u201cWe have to fight for the NHS, the same as the NHS was fought for when it was created,\u201d said Ferris\u2019 mother, Caroline Heggie, 70, a hospital union representative, who like her daughter had come to see the last night of \u201cNye\u201d at the National Theater last month. \u201cWe can\u2019t go the way of privatization, we can\u2019t go the way of America. That\u2019s what we\u2019re up against.\u201d",
      "Like Bevan, Sheen is a Welsh firebrand unafraid to wear his leftist politics. But he also lived for 14 years in Los Angeles, so knows too well what life is like without socialized health care.",
      "\u201cThe idea of this health care system that we have here, just seemed so alien to them over there,\u201d Sheen, who now lives back in his Welsh hometown of Port Talbot, says of his former American hosts. He says that \u201cseeing people go into hospitals with serious injuries or illnesses, and being asked to produce their checkbook before they can be treated\u201d would shock most Britons.",
      "The crisis at the NHS coincides with an uptick in hostility toward immigrants \u2014 even though they are often people\u2019s doctors, nurses and hospital cleaners. Almost 20% of NHS staff have a non-British nationality, with Indians, Filipinos, Nigerians, Irish and Poles making up most of their number.",
      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform U.K. party and an ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading some polls to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. He has become the first prospective leader to question the funding model of using taxes to fund the NHS \u2014 historically taboo.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work \u2014 it\u2019s not working,\u201d Farage told NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News in May. \u201cWe\u2019re getting worse bang for the buck than any other country, particularly out of those European neighbors.\u201d",
      "Opposing Farage\u2019s proposal, however, leaves open the specter of privatization, which many say has been creeping up even before the Health and Social Care Act 2012 opened up the NHS to bids from private contractors.",
      "Farage isn\u2019t the only person dissatisfied. Indeed, the NHS has slipped from being a world leader on many metrics.",
      "\u201cCorridor care\u201d is now a year-round crisis, and the number of people waiting 12 hours or more to be admitted into an emergency room rose from 47 in summer 2015 to 74,150 this summer. Targets have lagged for years in everything from ambulance attendance times to cancer diagnoses. Meanwhile, a 7 million-strong waiting list means many people feel abandoned for months, in pain, before getting hip or knee replacement and other types of surgery.",
      "There is ample evidence to suggest that economic austerity policies imposed during 14 years of Conservative Party rule are at least partly to blame, according to Max Warner, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a London research group.",
      "\u201cIt is true that a lot of NHS performance measures over the 2010s were broadly getting worse, having started off relatively well,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s worth saying that productivity did grow, so it\u2019s a nuanced picture and causality is difficult.\u201d",
      "The Conservatives argued that they kept NHS spending up, protecting it from the brutal cuts that crushed almost every other government department at the time. But this 2% yearly growth still fell well short of the 3.8% yearly average since the 1980s, and, according to critics, was insufficient to cope with an aging population and the rising prices of cutting-edge drugs.",
      "Far from the envy of the world, Britain has been scrimping by spending 37 billion pounds ($53 billion) on the health services each year, well below Germany, France and Australia, a landmark review found last year.",
      "The current Labour government has outlined plans to raise spending to around 3% \u2014 an improvement but still short of what many advocates had hoped. At his annual Labour Party conference this week, Starmer announced that a digital overhaul named NHS Online would launch in 2027, describing it as \u201ca new chapter in the story of our NHS.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, whatever the model, cash is key, according to Roy Lilley, who ran an NHS hospital in the 1990s as chairman of Homewood NHS Trust in Surrey, west of London.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you pay for your health care,\u201d said Lilley, today a consultant whose newsletter hits 300,000 inboxes. \u201cWhether you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018insurance,\u2019 or you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018taxes,\u2019 it\u2019s still your trousers.\u201d",
      "He remains optimistic, however, pointing to some waiting metrics improving and a general recovery from the hammerblow of the pandemic, which drained resources and mentally scarred doctors.",
      "Still, Sheen \u2014 never shy to mix acting with activism \u2014 believes it\u2019s no coincidence that the NHS is in crisis just when its origin story begins to vanish from living memory.",
      "\u201cThe crisis that we seem to be experiencing makes it all the more important to go back to the beginning and to look at what was behind the founding of the NHS, and what the principles were,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes incredibly important to tell the story of it and to remind people of what it was actually like, so that we don\u2019t forget.\u201d"

      "The humble soybean is the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to reshape global trade.",
      "Used in everything from animal feed to fuel, soybeans regularly rank among the most valuable U.S. agricultural exports, towering over higher-profile crops like corn and cotton.",
      "More than $30 billion worth of American soybean products were exported in fiscal year 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "For American soybean farmers, their top overseas market has long been China, which bought around a third of the export crop \u2014 approximately $12 billion worth of American soybean products \u2014 in the last calendar year, USDA data shows.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war leaves U.S.-China relations somewhere between frosty and openly hostile, America\u2019s soybean farmers appear to be an early casualty.",
      "An embargo in all but name",
      "So far, China has not purchased any U.S. soybeans during this year\u2019s main harvest period, with sales falling to zero in May.",
      "This has pushed many American farmers reliant on soybeans nearly to the breaking point.",
      "It has also complicated the Trump administration\u2019s plans to provide billions in foreign economic aid to Argentina.",
      "Buenos Aires recently sold more than 2.5 million metric tons of soybeans to Beijing, after briefly suspending its export tax on the soy products.",
      "U.S. officials blame China for the looming crisis facing American soybean producers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the Chinese leadership has decided to use the American farmers, soybean farmers in particular, as a hostage or pawn in the trade negotiations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday on CNBC.",
      "Farmers view the situation differently, however. They want Trump to reach a trade deal with China that ends the unofficial embargo on soybeans. But instead, what they see is the White House preparing to bail out one of their chief rivals for the Chinese export market.",
      "\u201cThe frustration is overwhelming,\u201d American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said in a recent statement.",
      "Meanwhile, China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest buyer of soybeans \u2014indicated last week that it won\u2019t resume U.S. purchases unless more Trump tariffs are lifted.",
      "\u201cAs for soybean trade, the U.S. side should take proactive steps to remove relevant unreasonable tariffs, create conditions for expanding bilateral trade, and inject more stability and certainty into global economic development,\u201d Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Beijing.",
      "Emergency relief is coming",
      "The Trump administration will announce new support for farmers, \u201cespecially the soybean farmers,\u201d on Tuesday, Bessent said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also going to be working with the Farm Credit Bureau to make sure that the farmers have what they need for the next planting season,\u201d he added.",
      "Bessent personally owns as much as $25 million worth of farmland in North Dakota that produces corn and soybeans, according to his recent financial disclosures.",
      "He said soybeans would be a topic of discussion at the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum later this month.",
      "Trump is also aware of the impact his trade policies are having on American farmers, starting with soybean growers.",
      "\u201cThe Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for \u2018negotiating\u2019 reasons only, not buying,\u201d the president posted Wednesday on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The question is whether this aid will come soon enough to save this year\u2019s massive harvest of soybeans.",
      "At the center of the firestorm is Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who warned this week that \u201cthis moment of uncertainty in the farm economy is real.\u201d Speaking on Fox Business Network, she emphasized that Trump has long supported U.S. farmers.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the President\u2019s November victory,\u201d the White House said in a statement Thursday. \u201cHe has made clear his intention to use tariff revenue to help our agricultural sector, but no final decisions on the contours of this plan have been made.\u201d",
      "The Argentina factor",
      "The current U.S.-China stalemate over soybean exports is also complicating another American foreign policy conundrum: what to do about Argentina\u2019s faltering economy.",
      "As U.S. soybean exports to China screech to a halt, Argentina\u2019s farmers jumped at the opportunity to sell China their own soybeans.",
      "From their perspective, a potential U.S. economic aid package has nothing to do with their soybean exports, and everything to do with the personal and political alliance between Trump and libertarian President Javier Milei.",
      "Milei was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his 2024 election victory, and he has become a familiar face at U.S. political events attended by the president\u2019s MAGA supporters.",
      "At a Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C. in February, Milei gifted then-Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk a red chainsaw.",
      "Musk then waved it around onstage, calling it \u201cthe chainsaw for bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "Eight months later, Milei\u2019s popularity with voters has plunged, raising doubts about the future of his market-friendly economic reforms and strict austerity measures.",
      "Local elections in early September dealt a blow to Milei\u2019s party, triggering massive turmoil in Argentina\u2019s stock and currency markets.",
      "A few weeks after the market plunge, Bessent announced on social media that the U.S. was prepared to deploy billions of dollars to support the South American country.",
      "A presidential delegation from Buenos Aires is expected to visit the White House next week to finalize the U.S. foreign aid deal.",
      "This has infuriated the soybean farmers.",
      "\u201cU.S. soybean prices are falling, harvest is underway, and farmers read headlines not about securing a trade agreement with China, but that the U.S. government is extending $20 billion in economic support to Argentina while that country drops its soybean export taxes to sell 20 shiploads of Argentine soybeans to China in just two days,\u201d Ragland said.",
      "Meanwhile, Milei has also secured a currency swap line for Argentina from China, a situation that gives pause to some in Washington.",
      "In response, Milei has said Argentina will maintain its mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship with China.",
      "Tensions inside the Trump administration over China, Argentina and the soybean farmers broke into the open last week.",
      "While attending the U.N. General Assembly, Bessent received a text message from a contact labeled \u201cBR.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe bailed out Argentina yesterday \u2026 and in return, the Argentine\u2019s removed their export tariff on grains, reducing their price, and sold a bunch of soybeans to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,\u201d read the message, widely presumed to come from Rollins.",
      "\u201cSoy prices are dropping further because of it. This gives China more leverage on us,\u201d the message concluded.",
      "Spokespeople for Bessent and Rollins did not respond to questions about the text message exchange."

    "summary": "ANALYSIS: Even if Trump succeeds in the Middl East where his predecessors failed, a Nobel prize would still be a longshot.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump likes to enumerate the peace deals he says he forged \u2014 seven at last count.",
      "But two that have eluded him potentially mean the most to his legacy and his dogged pursuit of the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "The first is the Russia-Ukraine war, which is no closer to ending now than when Trump took office in January. The other is Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Here, he may have just achieved a breakthrough.",
      "Up against a Sunday deadline that Trump had set, Hamas said Friday that it would meet a major condition that the president laid out in his 20-point plan for the war\u2019s end: releasing all the hostages, living or dead. Hamas\u2019 caveat was that \u201cthe field conditions for the exchange are met.\u201d",
      "Hamas also said it was prepared to enter into negotiations and turn over administrative control of Gaza to a Palestinian body of technocrats.",
      "Trump had been waiting on an answer from Hamas since Monday, when he released his peace plan at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He took Hamas\u2019 announcement as a good sign.",
      "\u201cBased on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE,\u201d he wrote on his social media site. \u201cIsrael must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!\u201d",
      "Ruby Chen, a hostage family member and a leading advocate, told NBC News: \u201cIt\u2019s a positive \u2014 we have cautious optimism. We know the president cares a lot about the hostages, so let\u2019s hope this is our time.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not done. There are still a lot of missing pieces, but it\u2019s positive,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump posted a video on Truth Social on Friday night in response to Hamas\u2019 announcement, saying: \u201cThis is a big day. We\u2019ll see how it all turns out. We have to get the final word down in concrete.\u201d",
      "The Middle East is a part of the world where conflict seems eternal, peace sporadic. Since President Harry Truman recognized the Jewish state in 1948, many presidents have tried to usher in peaceful relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, only to see conflict erupt again and again.",
      "Like Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and others before him, Trump is working to negotiate an accord among longtime combatants \u2014 an effort that dovetails with the White House\u2019s public campaign to get him the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "\u201cIf not now, when?\u201d said Richard Goldberg, who served on the National Security Council staff in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Even some of Trump\u2019s detractors said that Hamas\u2019 new position could be an encouraging step toward ending the war.",
      "\u201cLike the rest of the world, I\u2019m hoping this news means imminent return of the hostages and action addressing the Gaza humanitarian crisis, along with a ceasefire and path to peace and normalizing relations in the region,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News.",
      "Some were more skeptical, questioning whether Hamas can be trusted to follow through on its commitments.",
      "Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank, said, \u201cI\u2019d be a bit more cautious given that Hamas is a terrorist organization with a track record of saying one thing and doing another.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis may be the beginning of the end, but there is still more work to do,\u201d said a former Western diplomat with experience in the Middle East. \u201cHamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases. Trump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019 bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",
      "A European diplomat who has been closely engaged in the process said the situation remained extremely urgent: \u201cGet the hostages home. Worry about the details next.\u201d",
      "The diplomat acknowledged that as with any deal of this kind, the details and terms need to be worked out as the process moves forward.",
      "Even if Trump succeeds where his predecessors failed and creates conditions for Palestinians and Israelis to live together peacefully, a Nobel Peace Prize would still be a long shot.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties have criticized the Trump administration for launching deadly attacks on alleged foreign drug boats. Though he has embraced the title \u201cPresident of Peace,\u201d Trump just rebranded the Defense Department as the \u201cDepartment of War.\u201d",
      "The prize is awarded each year by five appointees of Norway\u2019s parliament. During Trump\u2019s first term, one member of parliament, Christian Tybring-Gjedde, was at the hairdresser waiting for his wife when his cellphone rang.",
      "Trump was calling.",
      "With the hair dryers whirring, Tybring-Gjedde said he had trouble hearing. The president thanked him for nominating him for the prize, Tybring-Gjedde said in an interview.",
      "Earlier this summer, Trump called another Norwegian, former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, and during the conversation also brought up the prize.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure he [Trump] really understands how this is done,\u201d Tybring-Gjedde said. \u201cThe Norwegian government has nothing to do with the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d",
      "A phone call may not sway anyone, but the Nobel judges would be hard-pressed to defy a president who brokered a Middle East peace deal at long last, Trump\u2019s supporters say.",
      "\u201cIt will be interesting if he does pull it off how the Nobel committee manages to ignore the fact that he did it,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican ally of the president, told NBC News."

      "Egypt\u2019s state-owned Al-Qahera News television station reported that the talks began with a meeting between Arab mediators and the Hamas delegation. Mediators will then meet with the Israeli delegation, the station said.",
      "Egyptian and Qatari mediators will discuss the outcome of their meetings with both parties, before U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff joins the talks, it said.",
      "\"I really think we\u2019re going to have a deal. We have a really good chance of making a deal, and it will be a lasting deal,\" President Donald Trump told reporters at a media gathering Monday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a briefing Monday that Witkoff and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner were holding talks with \"their respective parties from all sides.\"",
      "\"The president wants to see a ceasefire. He wants to see the hostages released, and the technical teams are discussing that as we speak to ensure that the environment is perfect to release those hostages,\" Leavitt said. \"They\u2019re going over the lists of both the Israeli hostages and also the political prisoners who will be released. And those talks are underway, and the president is very much on the ball and is being apprised of this situation.\"",
      "On the anniversary eve of Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, and subsequent military operation by Israel, representatives from all sides arrived in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to discuss a 20-point peace plan tabled by Trump to halt the conflict.",

      "Al-Hayya, whom Israeli President Isaac Herzog described as a \"murderous terrorist\" in the wake of the Qatar strike, arrived in Egypt early Monday, Hamas said in a statement.",
      "Israel\u2019s delegation will be led by Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office Sunday.",
      "The two sides have agreed on parts of Trump\u2019s proposal.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner traveled to Egypt to help hammer out the deal\u2019s remaining sticking points, a senior White House official told NBC News on Saturday.",
      "Trump called the talks \"very successful, and proceeding rapidly,\" and said Monday\u2019s meetings was just a case of technical teams clarifying \"final details.\" He wrote in a social media post that \"the first phase should be completed this week.\"",
      "Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian American mediator, said in an interview that Hamas leaders were optimistic about the prospects of arriving at an agreement and feel specifically reassured by Trump's recent comments. They believe Trump is the only person who can pressure Netanyahu into a deal, Bahbah added.",

      "On Monday, the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters, a group that coordinates efforts for those still held in Gaza, sent an \"urgent letter\" to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, \"strongly urging\" the body to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the American president this week \"for his unprecedented contributions to global peace.\"",
      "A senior Arab negotiator directly involved in the talks told NBC News on Monday, \"A deal will happen if President Trump keeps pushing.\"",

      "It came as Israel said it deported 171 activists, including the campaigner Greta Thunberg, who sailed toward Gaza on an aid flotilla. The detainees, whose vessels were boarded by Israeli military personnel, were deported to Greece and Slovakia, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement.",
      "The first phase of the talks will deal with the release of the remaining 48 hostages, some 20 of whom are believed to still be alive, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.",
      "The plan also calls for the end of fighting and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Hamas agreed to some of this proposal Friday, while sidestepping Trump\u2019s call for it to disband and disarm.",
      "On Sunday, Hamas leader Mahmoud Mardawi denied as baseless reports in Arab media that the group had agreed to lay down its weapons.",
      "Israel says it agrees with the plan, buoying the yearslong, impassioned domestic campaign by families and supporters of the hostages to cease fighting so they can be brought home.",
      "Ohad Ben Ami, 56, was released in February, having been kidnapped from kibbutz Be\u2019eri, in southern Israel, and held captive for 491 days. On Sunday, he showed NBC News the place where he was taken on Oct. 7.",
      "\"When we were down there\" in the deep Gaza tunnel where he was held, he said he was told \"many times there was a deal in the air,\" he said. \"We were very happy and on a high, then they say, 'no it\u2019s collapsed' and we were very depressed.\"",
      "Still, Netanyahu faces pressure from his own government over negotiations. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on X that stopping attacks on Gaza would be a \u201cgrave mistake.\"",
      "In Gaza, many Palestinians are desperate for an end to the bombardment that has killed more than 67,000 people, most of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Some 78% of buildings have either been damaged or destroyed.",
      "The prospect of an agreement has not stopped the Israeli attacks. Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run Government Media Office said Sunday that Israel had carried out 131 airstrikes on Gaza over the past 48 hours, killing 94 Palestinians.",
      "Israel launched the offensive after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terror attack, in which some 1,200 were killed and another 250 kidnapped.",

      "Chinese rescuers were on Monday rushing to evacuate hundreds of hikers stranded on the eastern slope of the world's highest mountain, Mount Everest, after heavy snowfall blanketed campsites over the weekend.",
      "Nearly 350 hikers have already traveled to safety at a rendezvous point in the small township of Qudang, according to state broadcaster CCTV, with rescuers also in contact with more than 200 hikers remaining who \u201cwill gradually arrive at the rendezvous point.\u201d",
      "Local news outlets had initially reported that nearly 1,000 people had been affected by the blizzard.  Local rescue officials were not immediately available for comment on the discrepancy in numbers.",
      "No casualties were reported, according to local media.",
      "\u201cAbout one-third into the trek, it began to rain and the rain kept getting heavier,\u201d Chen Geshuang, a 28-year-old astrophotographer who began climbing Saturday afternoon but decided to retreat Sunday, told NBC News in an online video interview.",
      "\u201cLater, it turned into sleet, and eventually a full-on blizzard.\u201d",
      "Some hikers shoveled snow out of their tents amid the blizzard, while others waded in a line through the snowstorm in poor visibility, social media videos verified by NBC News showed.",
      "The hikers had been trapped at nearly 16,000 feet, according to a report in Jimu News, which added that local villagers and rescue teams had been deployed to clear the roads blocked by snow.",
      "The unusually intense snowfall began Friday night and continued through Saturday in the Gama Valley of Tingri county in the autonomous region of Tibet, \"disrupting the itineraries of some tourists hiking in the area,\" CCTV said.",
      "Within hours, some of Chen\u2019s team were exhibiting signs of mild hypothermia and cold stress, she said. By Saturday night, the storm intensified with lightning almost every minute.",
      "\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking night,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we woke up this morning, the snow was extremely deep \u2014 about 1 meter, reaching up to our thighs.\u201d",
      "The group decided to retreat, arriving at the foot of the mountain Sunday evening. Neighboring Nepal was also hit with heavy rainfall, where at least 44 people were killed from landslides and floods.",
      "The severe weather event occurred as more than 299 million people were expected to travel regionally Sunday due to a weeklong national holiday that included China's National Day last week and the Mid-Autumn Festival on Monday, CCTV said in a separate report.",
      "Ticket sales and entry to the Everest Scenic Area were suspended late Saturday, according to notices on the official WeChat accounts of the local Tingri County Tourism Co.",
      "Mount Everest, at 29,000 feet, is called Mount Qomolangma in Chinese, and it stretches along the border of Tibet and Nepal, and climbers from both countries attempt to scale the peak along different slopes.",
      "While the Nepalese side has seen a boom in Everest-related tourism and significant investment, the Tibetan side is especially remote."

      "LONDON \u2014 An Israeli minister has clashed with the U.K.\u2019s leading Jewish organizations after lauding a leader of the English far right and inviting him to visit the country.",
      "Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record who is well known for inspiring rallies of mostly white, mostly male followers shouting soccer-style chants against Islam and immigration, accepted the invitation from Amichai Chikli, Israel\u2019s minister for the diaspora and combating antisemitism.",
      "Chikli called Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 a \u201ccourageous leader on the front line against radical Islam.\u201d",
      "Writing on X Friday, Chilki said he would be \u201cproud to host\u201d Robinson \u201con behalf of the State of Israel,\u201d saying the British activist would visit in mid-October.",
      "The Jewish Leadership Council (JLC), which represents the largest Jewish organizations in the United Kingdom, and the Board of Deputies, called Robinson a \u201cthug\u201d who \u201crepresents the very worst of Britain,\u201d and criticized the invitation in the wake of a deadly terrorist attack at a synagogue in Manchester.",
      "\u201cIn our darkest hour,\u201d both groups posted on X Saturday, Chikli has \u201cignored the views of the vast majority of British Jews, who utterly and consistently reject Robinson and everything he stands for.\u201d",
      "There has been a rise in anti-Jewish hostility in Britain, predating the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that started two years ago, according to community groups and the people suffering the firsthand effects in the United Kingdom.",
      "Robinson\u2019s invitation to Israel \u201cundermines those genuinely working to tackle Islamist extremism and foster community cohesion,\u201d the two groups added. \u201cMinister Chikli has proven himself to be a Diaspora Minister in name only.\u201d",
      "Chikli, who has clashed repeatedly with Jewish groups abroad, said the Board of Deputies had \u201cregrettably, become first and foremost a political organization \u2014 openly aligned with left-wing, woke, pro-Palestinian parties.\u201d",
      "The Board of Deputies says it is committed to fighting antisemitism, tackling extremism and standing for security in Israel and the Middle East.",
      "Neither Israel\u2019s prime minister\u2019s office nor the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism immediately responded to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Robinson said he had accepted the invitation and that he would travel to Israel \u201cimmediately following my October 13th trial.\u201d",
      "The 42-year-old recently served an 18-month jail sentence for contempt of court, a charge stemming from a libelous video in which he falsely claimed a Syrian refugee teenager was a violent thug.",
      "Elon Musk called for Robinson to be freed while he was imprisoned, and has since thrown his support behind the activist, most recently at far-right rally in London where the billionaire entrepreneur appeared by video link and railed against \u201cuncontrolled immigration.\u201d",
      "Robinson was first jailed in 2005 for assaulting an off-duty police officer and ordered to do community service in 2011 for leading a brawl involving more than 100 soccer fans. He was imprisoned again in 2013 for traveling to the United States on another person\u2019s passport, then again a year later for mortgage fraud.",
      "Robinson, who took his pseudonym from a soccer hooligan, was also given a five-year stalking protection order in October 2021 after he shouted abuse outside the home of a journalist, having learned she was planning a story about him.",
      "During that time, he co-founded the English Defence League, or EDL, which rose out of a disparate network of far-right groups and whose virulently Islamophobic views were praised by Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway\u2019s worst peacetime atrocity in July 2011 and has frequently made Nazi salutes when attending court.",
      "In 2023, organizers of a march against antisemitism in London demanded that the far-right leader Stephen Yaxley-Lennon stay away from their demonstration."

      "Leo, the first U.S. pope, told thousands of pilgrims celebrating Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square that immigrants should not be treated with \u201cthe coldness of indifference or the stigma of discrimination.\u201d",

      "'New missionary age'",
      "Leo had criticized the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies on September 30, questioning whether they were in line with the Catholic Church\u2019s pro-life teachings, in comments that drew heated backlash from some prominent conservative Catholics.",
      "On Sunday, the pope said the global Church was experiencing \u201ca new missionary age\u201d in which it was tasked with offering \u201chospitality and welcome, compassion and solidarity\u201d to migrants fleeing violence or searching for a safe place to live.",
      "\u201cIn the communities of ancient Christian tradition, such as those of the West, the presence of many brothers and sisters from the world\u2019s South should be welcomed as an opportunity, through an exchange that renews the face of the Church,\u201d he said.",
      "Elected in May to replace the late Pope Francis, Leo has shown a much more reserved style than his predecessor, who frequently criticized the Trump administration and often spoke in surprise, off-the-cuff remarks.",
      "Leo spoke on Sunday from a prepared text. He was addressing a weekend event during the Catholic Church\u2019s ongoing holy year that was specially organised for migrants, which the Vatican said had attracted more than 10,000 pilgrims from some 95 countries."

      "Under the plan, Israel\u2019s assault in Gaza would end immediately once both sides agree to the proposal, with all hostages, alive and dead, to be released within 72 hours. The plan says no one will be forced to leave Gaza and those who do can return.",

      "During that race, Trump highlighted a deep rift in the Democratic Party over the war that pitted pro-Israel moderates against liberal defenders of Palestinians. Though Trump\u2019s focus on helping negotiate a permanent ceasefire has waxed and waned over the course of his eight-plus months in office, the conflict was never off his radar.",

Hamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cTrump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019s bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",

      "Early last week in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, a slick, larger-than-life video screen beamed out four words that would drive tech giant Alibaba\u2019s stock to historic levels and signal a shift in China\u2019s approach to artificial intelligence: \u201cRoadmap to Artificial Superintelligence.\u201d",
      "During his 23-minute keynote address at the flagship Alibaba Cloud conference, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu charted out a future featuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial superintelligence (ASI). These terms point to a theorized era in which AI becomes roughly as smart as humans (AGI) and then much, much smarter (ASI).",
      "While these terms have been tossed around Silicon Valley for years, Wu\u2019s presentation was notable: Alibaba is now the first established Chinese tech giant to explicitly invoke AGI and ASI.",
      "\u201cAchieving AGI \u2014 an intelligent system with general human-level cognition \u2014 now appears inevitable. Yet AGI is not the end of AI\u2019s development, but its beginning,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIt will march toward ASI \u2014 intelligence beyond the human, capable of self-iteration and continuous evolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cASI will drive exponential technological leaps, carrying us into an unprecedented age of intelligence,\u201d Wu said, highlighting ASI\u2019s ability to help cure diseases, discover cleaner sources of energy and even unlock interstellar travel.",
      "The U.S. and China are the world\u2019s leading AI powers, each with immense computing capabilities and top-tier researchers developing cutting-edge systems. Yet observers have framed the countries as having different approaches to AI, with perceptions that China focuses more on real-world AI applications.",
      "For example, commentators recently argued that Beijing is currently \u201cwinning the race for AI robots\u201d against the U.S., as China is home to much of the world\u2019s most advanced robotics supply chains and a growing network of robotics, or embodied AI, labs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been some commentary in Western media recently about how the U.S. is missing the point by pushing for AGI, while China is focusing solely on applications,\u201d said Helen Toner, interim executive director of Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome Chinese researchers and some parts of the Chinese government have been interested in AGI and superintelligence for a long time,\u201d Toner said, though she noted this view was primarily held by smaller startups like DeepSeek.",
      "Afra Wang, a researcher focusing on China\u2019s tech scene, said Alibaba\u2019s invocation of AGI and ASI was remarkable.",
      "\u201cThis ASI narrative is definitely something new, especially among the biggest tech companies in China,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Alibaba\u2019s \u201croadmap to artificial superintelligence\u201d seems to scramble mainstream perceptions. Any number of California techno-optimists, like Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei or xAI\u2019s Elon Musk, might have delivered Wu\u2019s speech, selling a technology-enabled utopia while largely sidestepping darker questions about how humanity would co-exist with or survive an era of digital superintelligence.",
      "The concept of superintelligence has long been on the minds of \u2014 if not explicitly guiding \u2014 prominent American AI companies. For example, OpenAI released an article focused on the safe development of superintelligent AI models in May 2023. \u201cNow is a good time to start thinking about the governance of superintelligence \u2014 future AI systems dramatically more capable than even AGI,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The possibility of superintelligence is now even being acknowledged in Congress. On Monday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., announced a draft bill that would, among other actions, \u201cassist Congress in determining the potential for controlled AI systems to reach artificial superintelligence.\u201d",
      "To some, ASI might seem like an outlandish concept when today\u2019s AI systems fail to understand basic tennis rules, hallucinate or fabricate basic information, or do not seem to actually comprehend how the external world functions.",
      "At the same time, AI systems continue to approach and sometimes surpass human capabilities in many domains, from driving cars safely to winning international coding competitions, leaving many experts to say it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, humans develop digital superintelligence.",
      "As the idea of superintelligence gradually enters mainstream debates, many American politicians have announced that the U.S. is in an AI race with China. The White House\u2019s current AI manifesto is titled \u201cWinning the AI Race: America\u2019s AI Action Plan,\u201d while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, proclaimed that \u201cas a matter of economic security, as a matter of national security, America has to beat China in the AI race.\u201d",
      "Yet charges of an AI race are muddied by a lack of an agreed end goal and swirling definitions of AGI. At worst, experts think an unfettered race toward AGI or ASI could lead to widespread catastrophe or even the end of humanity.",
      "But there\u2019s also plenty of skepticism around talk of AGI and ASI and whether it\u2019s primarily for marketing purposes.",
      "Alibaba is one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, known for providing powerful, free AI models \u2014 also called open-source models \u2014 for download. Alibaba\u2019s Qwen model series, a competitor to models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 or Anthropic\u2019s Claude, is the most popular open-source AI system in the world.",
      "Wu announced a new series of Qwen models in his speech last week, including a model that combines text, images, video and audio capabilities.",
      "Many observers point out that narratives about a U.S.-China AI race and a resulting sprint to build AI infrastructure serve AI investors by propping up company valuations and increasing their soft power. Alibaba\u2019s stock has soared since Wu\u2019s speech last week, part of a larger $250 billion comeback this year that has made it China\u2019s hottest AI company.",
      "To unlock a powerful, superintelligent future, Wu predicted that large AI models will replace existing operating systems as the link between users, software and computational power. This future network of large AI models will run on cloud computing networks like Alibaba Cloud, he said.",
      "Irene Zhang, a researcher on China\u2019s AI ecosystem and an editor of ChinaTalk, noted the business undertones of Wu\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cThis is a vision of AGI and ASI that\u2019s directly based on Alibaba\u2019s business model,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAlibaba Cloud dominates China\u2019s cloud computing market, and its global market share is now bigger than Oracle\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cAlibaba\u2019s commercial strategy and its publicly stated views on ASI/AGI are symbiotic.\u201d",
      "Matt Sheehan, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, agreed.",
      "\u201cASI is the ultimate frontier, as far as the discourse goes on AI,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cIt\u2019s notable that Alibaba set this grandiose goal, but in reality, they\u2019re selling cloud services.\u201d",

      "Takaichi defeated Shinjiro Koizumi 185 to 156 in a second-round runoff vote to become leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II.",
      "The leadership race was triggered last month when Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he would step down after a year in office. Though Takaichi is likely to succeed him as prime minister of Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, when parliament votes later this month, it is not guaranteed since the LDP-led coalition lost its majority in both houses in the past year.",
      "\u201cRight now, rather than feeling happy, I truly believe this is where the real challenge begins,\u201d Takaichi said in her victory speech. \u201cThere is a mountain of work we must all tackle together.\u201d",
      "She also said it was important to make the LDP, which has been tarnished by corruption scandals, \u201ca more spirited and vibrant party, a party that transforms people\u2019s anxieties into hope.\u201d",
      "Takaichi, 64, a hard-line conservative who says her hero is former British leader Margaret Thatcher, was an ally of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader.",
      "Though many party members welcome Takaichi\u2019s ascendance as a potential return to the days of Abe, there are concerns that her nationalistic historical views could cause friction with East Asian neighbors China and South Korea.",
      "\u201cBeijing is likely to object to Takaichi\u2019s positions on revising Japan\u2019s postwar pacifist constitution, strengthening maritime security, and bolstering support for Taiwan,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "One of the top priorities for Japan\u2019s next prime minister will be implementing the trade deal reached with the Trump administration in July. The agreement, which imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods including its crucial auto exports, has yet to be put in writing and many of the details remain unclear.",
      "Takaichi has raised the possibility of reopening talks on the deal, which includes a pledge by Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S.",
      "She told reporters after her victory on Saturday that she did not intend to \u201coverturn\u201d anything that Japan and the United States had agreed upon.",
      "\u201cI will firmly adhere to the agreement reached between our two countries,\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cThis applies to tariffs and also investments as well.\u201d",
      "The LDP voted on five leadership candidates in the first round, with Takaichi securing 183 votes to Koizumi\u2019s 164. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, the top spokesperson for the current Japanese government, came in third with 134 votes after a recent surge in polls.",
      "Votes in the first round were divided evenly between 294 LDP lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members who were represented by 295 votes. Lawmakers favored the more moderate Koizumi, while party members preferred Takaichi, who has a passionate base.",
      "In the second round, lawmakers had the same number of votes while rank-and-file party members had 47, representing the 47 prefectures of Japan.",
      "Lawmakers in the second round voted 149 to 145 in favor of Takaichi, while party members gave her 36 votes compared with Koizumi\u2019s 11.",
      "Koizumi, 44, the current agriculture minister and the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, would have been Japan\u2019s youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who was just a few months younger than Koizumi when he became the country\u2019s first prime minister in 1885.",

    "summary": "The terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, has stoked fears among Britain's Jewish community amid a rise in antisemitism.",
    "story": [
      "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was shocked by Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar.",
      "But for many British Jews, this was anything but a shock, rather the culmination of a wave of antisemitism in Britain that was rising before Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel\u2019s subsequent military assault on Gaza \u2014  and has only intensified since.",
      "There has been a rise in anti-Jewish hostility in Britain that predates the attack in Israel and the Gaza war that started three years ago, according to community groups and the people suffering the first-hand effects in the United Kingdom. But the incident at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall has brought the issue of antisemitism to the fore again \u2014 leaving many Jewish people in Britain worried for the safety of their friends and family.",
      "\u201cI just keep thinking about my children,\u201d said Josh Simons, a member of Parliament who represents the Makerfield constituency near Manchester, and whose family fled persecution in Europe for the relative safety of England around a century ago. \u201cI\u2019ve got two young kids and I think everybody in this community will be holding their children tonight that little bit closer.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News on Thursday that the community was feeling \u201cfrightened, scared and hurt.\u201d",
      "Two men, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed during the attack on the synagogue.",
      "Greater Manchester Police said Friday that one of them suffered a wound as armed officers attempted to shoot the attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, who drove into a group of people before stabbing a man. Al-Shamie did not have a firearm. But for many in the Jewish community the attack, which also left three people injured, was the culmination of something that had been festering for some time.",
      "\u201cThis is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come,\u201d Britain\u2019s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, also said in a statement. \u201cFor so long we have witnessed an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, on campuses, on social media and elsewhere \u2014 this is the tragic result,\u201d he added.",
      "Since Israel launched its military offensive in the wake of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on the country, there has been a spike in antisemitic incidents in Britain, according to the Community Security Trust, a charity that coordinates security measures at Jewish institutions and tracks this data. The group defines antisemitism as \u201chatred, bigotry, prejudice or discrimination against Jews,\u201d on its website.",
      "That year, 2023, saw 4,103 antisemitic incidents reported to the CST \u2014 the most on record \u2014 and last year\u2019s 3,528 was the second highest. Swastikas and other graffiti have been daubed on synagogues and other sites, and security has been heightened at Jewish schools.",
      "In the space of a week last month, urine and feces were smeared over seven synagogues and a children\u2019s nursery in Golders Green, a part of north London known for its large Jewish population. \u201cThese repeated attacks have left our community anxious, hurt and increasingly worried,\u201d a spokesperson for the local Shomrim community Jewish patrol group said at the time.",
      "In May, a Jewish-owned business in nearby Stamford Hill, which has a large Orthodox Jewish community, was daubed in red paint and had its windows smashed. Graffiti alleged the firm had links to an Israeli arms manufacturer, but traumatized staff there said this wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that the number of attacks has increased since the Gaza conflict,\u201d Graham Stringer, another member of Parliament serving Blackley and Middleton, another constituency close to Manchester, said  in an interview Friday. \u201cThe Jewish community has been angry and frightened and so, incidentally, has the Muslim community.\u201d",
      "There was an increase in religious hate crimes targeted against Muslims since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, with 3,866 offenses in the year leading up to March 2024, according to the latest government data. This was up 13% from 3,432 recorded the previous year, the data showed.",
      "Perhaps this is why the 2025 Jewish Landscape Report, an annual global survey, found that 81% of respondents in Britain felt the need to conceal their Jewishness in public.",
      "In a febrile atmosphere, Starmer is now under pressure to reassure British Jews \u2014 who make up just 290,000 of Britain\u2019s 70-million population, according to the last census in 2021 \u2014 that they are safe.",
      "He said Thursday he would do \u201ceverything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community.\u201d",
      "The necessity of that was evident hours after the incident in Manchester, when two cars drove past the scene displaying Palestinian flags, while some men in balaclavas could be heard muttering about \u201cJews\u201d, according to a Reuters journalist at the scene.",
      "Other observers were dismayed to see pro-Palestinian marches going ahead Thursday evening in Manchester, London and other cities.",
      "There have been regular marches and protests in cities across the country about Israel\u2019s conduct during the war, which will enter its third year Tuesday. Among the crowds, which have on occasion contained tens of thousands, there have been displays of violent antisemitic sentiment, as well as language that conflates enmity toward Israel, Zionism and Jews themselves.",
      "On Friday, protesters said they were supporting an urgent cause, specifically the aid flotilla that was intercepted by the Israeli military en route to Gaza.",
      "But for others \u2014 both in and outside the Jewish community \u2014 it was disappointing not to have a pause in the demonstrations that have often been interpreted as hostile by British Jews.",
      "\u201cI do think that carrying on in this way does feel un-British, it feels wrong,\u201d Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC. \u201cIt is important to draw a line between what is happening in the Middle East and what is happening at home.\u201d"

      "Asked if the monarchy would be shifting in a different direction when he becomes king, the Prince of Wales said: \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that change is on my agenda.

      "Conservative nationalist Sanae Takaichi, 64, and the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi, 44, are the front-runners among the five candidates. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, who is currently the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, has also surged in public opinion polls and could end up on top.",
      "The new LDP leader will be selected by 295 lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members, who will be represented by another 295 votes. The top two candidates are likely to then enter a runoff.",

      "\u201cTheir view is that the LDP has to return to its DNA to be the right-wing conservative party, and that Takaichi is the one best positioned to sort of return to the glory of Abe,\u201d Kingston said.",

      "\u201cShe does project strength in the way that Margaret Thatcher projected strength, and she wants to be that kind of Iron Lady of Japan,\u201d said Jeffrey Hall, a special lecturer in Japanese studies at Kanda University of International Studies.",

      "Moderate forces could unite behind another candidate to block Takaichi from winning, much as they did in last year\u2019s leadership race when she lost to Ishiba.",
      "One person who stands to benefit from that scenario is Hayashi, who like Koizumi is Ivy League-educated. Having served in almost every major cabinet post, including foreign minister, Hayashi \u201creally stands for experience and stability,\u201d Hall said.",
      "All of the candidates have talked tough on immigration, an increasingly sensitive issue in Japan, where tourists are coming in record numbers and foreign-born residents make up a growing proportion of the population as the government grapples with labor shortages.",
      "But Takaichi has taken the strongest stances, decrying the rudeness of foreign tourists and accusing them of abusing the famous deer in Nara.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s definitely appealing to the online conservatives who have very strong anti-foreign feelings,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Koizumi, Takaichi and Hayashi all have roughly the same policy toward the U.S., \u201cwhich is keeping the status quo,\u201d he said.",
      "At the moment, the U.S. relationship \u201cis a huge headache for Japan,\u201d and there are signs that the trade deal reached with President Donald Trump in July is \u201cunraveling,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "The impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs has been especially felt by Japan\u2019s crucial auto industry, including brands popular in the U.S. such as Nissan, Honda and Toyota.",
      "Last month the U.S. tariff on cars imported from Japan was lowered to 15% from 27.5%, the same rate the U.S. imposes on almost all Japanese goods under the deal, which has yet to be put in writing. But that is still considerably higher than the previous 2.5%.",
      "The tariffs were lowered in part because Japan pledged $550 billion in U.S. investment, though there are disagreements between Washington and Tokyo as to what form that investment will take and how each country will benefit.",
      "A major challenge for Japan\u2019s next leader will be implementing the trade agreement \u201cin a way that Trump will be satisfied,\u201d Hall said.",
      "\u201cWhoever becomes prime minister will continue Japan\u2019s foreign policy of flattering Trump and being as friendly as possible to Trump,\u201d he said, \u201cand not trying to have any kind of situation where they\u2019ll have open disagreement that could cause Trump to turn on Japan in any way.\u201d"
