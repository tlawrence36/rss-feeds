      "Wee Meng Chee, a well-known Malaysian rapper and filmmaker, has been detained in connection with the murder of Taiwanese influencer Hsieh Yu-hsin",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- A popular ethnic Chinese Malaysian rapper and filmmaker was detained Wednesday to assist police in their investigation into the murder of a Taiwanese social media influencer, the rapper's lawyer said.",
      "Wee Meng Chee, popularly known as Namewee, surrendered to police early Wednesday and will be placed under remand for six days, said his lawyer Joshua Tay. Police said Tuesday they were searching for Wee after they reclassified Hsieh Yu-hsin's death as a murder following the discovery of unspecified new evidence.",
      "Hsieh, 31, who had more than half a million followers on Instagram and also operated an OnlyFans account, was found dead in a hotel bathtub in Kuala Lumpur on Oct. 22. According to local media reports, police said Wee was the last person seen with her before her death. Wee was briefly detained at the time and separately charged for drug possession and use, allegations he denied.",
      "A former nurse, Hsieh was known as \u201cNurse Goddess\u201d by her fans. Police said she arrived in Malaysia on Oct. 20 and was scheduled to stay for four days. Police are waiting for the full post-mortem and toxicology reports before releasing the official cause of her death, local media reported.",
      "Wee, 42, said he was deeply saddened by Hsieh's death but denied any wrongdoing. In an Instagram post after his surrender, he vowed to cooperate with the investigation to provide answers to the public and Hsieh's family.",
      "\u201cI hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and with the utmost objectivity and fairness,\u201d said Tay, the lawyer.",
      "A provocative and outspoken artist, Wee has been arrested and questioned by police multiple times in the past over over his satirical takes on politics, race and religion in his music videos and movies. He defends his right to artistic expression and says his videos use satire to highlight social issues in Malaysia.",

      "In 2016, he was detained after Malay Islamic activists complained that a music video made by Wee titled \u201cOh My God,\u201d which was filmed at various places of worship and used the word \u201cAllah,\u201d which means God in the Malay language, was disrespectful to Islam. Wee said the video was meant to promote religious tolerance and he was not charged.",
      "Wee was detained again in 2018 over complaints about a music video featuring dancers in dog masks who performed what authorities said were \u201cobscene\u201d moves that insulted Islam and could hurt racial harmony. Dogs are considered unclean by Muslims, who account for about two-thirds of Malaysia\u2019s 34 million people.",
      "Wee said his criticism was aimed at hypocrisy and abuse of power, not religion or race.",
      "Wee has also faced backlash in China. He released a song in 2021 with Australian singer Kimberley Chen that poked fun at Chinese nationalists and touched on sensitive topics, like Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty. Beijing banned both singers from entering the country and removed their song from all Chinese platforms.",

      "Stewart, who directed \u201cThe Chronology of Water,\u201d an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch\u2019s 2011 memoir, began her remarks with some humor, but she quickly turned to gender inequity in Hollywood.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s awkward to talk about inequality for some people,\u201d Stewart said Tuesday at the Academy Women\u2019s Luncheon. \u201cWe can discuss wage gaps and taxes on tampons and measure it in lots of quantifiable ways, but the violence of silencing. ... It\u2019s like we\u2019re not even supposed to be angry. But ... I\u2019m so angry.\u201d",
      "Stewart said she was invited to speak about the women who inspire her and began with Yuknavitch, whose memoir she credited with \u201cgiving voice to certain truths I inherently understood.\u201d",
      "\u201cHard truths, when spoken out loud, become springboards to freedom,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe permission to be unpalatable, unsanitary, and to come from the inside out \u2026 led me to acknowledge the invisible cage that we are all living in and how easy it is to story our way out there.\"",
      "Stewart was the keynote speaker at the event held at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures with attendees including Tessa Thompson, Kate Hudson, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Claire Foy, Kerry Condon, Patty Jenkins and Emma Mackey.",
      "Many actors in attendance dressed in Chanel clothing, jewelry, shoes, makeup and accessories. The luxury fashion brand, which sponsored the event, has had a long association with film and women creatives since founder Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel saw an opportunity to put her designs in the movies and empower women in film.",
      "While reflecting on the state of women's filmmaking in the post MeToo era, Stewart said it seemed possible that stories made by and for women were finally getting their due.",
      "\u201cBut I can now attest to the bare-knuckle brawling that it takes every step of the way when the content is too dark, too taboo,\u201d she said before adding that \u201cour business is in a state of emergency.\u201d",
      "After Stewart's remark, she paused as the audience murmured in agreement.",
      "\u201cWe are allowed to be proud of ourselves,\u201d she said. \u201cBut let\u2019s try not to be tokenized. Let's start printing our own currency.\u201d",

      "He said it is \u201ca remarkable, addictive book. Garner takes the diary form, mixing the intimate, the intellectual, and the everyday, to new heights.",
      "\u201cThere are places it\u2019s toe-curlingly embarrassing. She puts it all out there,\u201d Millen said, adding that Garner ranks alongside those of Virginia Woolf in the canon of great literary diarists.",
      "Garner, who has published novels, short stories, screenplays and true crime books, said she was \u201cstaggered\u201d to have won the prize for diaries she wrote entirely for herself.",

      "\u201cThose are the hours of practice that in a sense turned me into a writer. Because I\u2019ve been keeping a diary since I was a girl \u2014 and I\u2019ve burnt most of it, of course. I burnt it up until about the late 1970s. But it\u2019s my 10,000 hours and it\u2019s my enormous daily practice. So you never expect that to be out in the public eye. But it is.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to End a Story\u201d is a deeply intimate book that among other things recounts, with unsparing detail and flashes of humor, the breakdown of a marriage.",
      "Despite the risk involved in such public soul-baring, Garner says the reaction of readers has made the experience life-affirming.",
      "\u201cWhat I write about \u2014 my life and my experience and my, not to put too fine a point on it, soul \u2014 there are so many people who know what I mean and who\u2019ve been there. And that\u2019s been a great joy to me to discover that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe deeper I go, the more other people I find there.\u201d",

      "The landmark royal exhibition will feature some 200 items \u2014 about half of them never publicly displayed before \u2014 that chart the monarch's life and her historic 70-year reign.",
      "Elizabeth, who died in September 2022 at 96, was the longest-reigning monarch Britain has ever known, and her clothing archive is considered one of the most important collections of 20th-century British fashion. She would have celebrated her 100th birthday on April 21, 2026.",
      "Highlights include a tulle bridesmaid dress worn by an 8-year-old Princess Elizabeth in 1934 and many beautifully tailored couture dresses by the monarch's most influential designer, Norman Hartnell.",
      "Hartnell was the man behind an apple-green gown the queen wore for a state banquet given for U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower in Washington, D.C. in 1957; a pastel blue gown with matching jacket that Elizabeth wore for her sister Princess Margaret's 1960 wedding; as well as the queen's own wedding and coronation dresses.",
      "Visitors to the exhibition will also see items from Elizabeth's private, off-duty wardrobe, from her riding clothes and Harris tweed jackets to raincoats and headscarves, as well as design sketches and fabric samples that give an insight into the process of dressing her.",

      "In the last few years, the Grammy Awards have made a concerted effort to diversify its electorate",
      "NEW YORK -- In the last few years, the Grammy Awards have made a concerted effort to diversify its electorate. In 2024, the Recording Academy revealed significant changes to its evolving voting body, saying 66% of voters joined in the previous five years, a number of whom were women and people of color. This year, there's even more movement: For the first time ever, all Latin Grammy voting members were invited to join the Recording Academy as part of its 2025 new member class.",
      "The Latin Grammys are a licensee of the Grammys and follow a similar voting process. But while the Grammys focus on the U.S. market, the Latin Grammys have global considerations, according to Latin Recording Academy CEO Manuel Abud. The Recording Academy also has a number of members on the Latin Grammys board.",
      "The results are notable: There are 3,800 new Recording Academy members in 2025. Half \u2014 50% \u2014 are 39 and under, 58% are people of color and 35% identify as women.",
      "And in that group, there are approximately 2,900 new Grammy voting members. Nearly half, 49%, are 39 and under; 60% are people of color and 30% identify as women.",
      "Over the last few years, Latin music has been skyrocketing in popularity, routinely celebrated as one of the fastest growing streaming genres in the United States.",
      "\u201cThe addition of many Latin Recording Academy voting members underscores that music has no borders and that our mission to serve music people, regardless of where they are from, is stronger than ever,\u201d Harvey Mason jr., academy president and CEO, wrote in a statement. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for our members\u2019 passion and hard work to shine through in this year\u2019s nominations.\u201d",

      "Lee Soo Man spent three decades trying to bring K-pop into the global market, often bending but never breaking his vision",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Lee Soo Man resisted the title at first. \u201cKing of K-pop\u201d sounded too brash, too nightclub-esque \u2014 like something you\u2019d see on a neon sign in Itaewon, a nightlife neighborhood in the South Korean capital Seoul once popular with U.S. soldiers and foreign visitors. \u201cI asked them, \u2018Couldn\u2019t it be Father of K-pop?\u2019\u201d the 73-year-old recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "He was discussing the title of Amazon Prime's documentary about his career. The producers insisted the bolder moniker would resonate better with American audiences. After some back-and-forth, Lee relented. \u201cI had to follow their decision.\u201d",
      "The compromise speaks to Lee\u2019s pragmatic approach to breaking South Korean acts into the American mainstream \u2014 a three-decade quest that often required him to bend but never break his vision. Now, as the founder of SM Entertainment and widely credited as the architect of K-pop\u2019s global expansion, Lee will be inducted into the Asian Hall of Fame on Saturday alongside basketball legend Yao Ming, Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan, and rock icon Yoshiki, among others.",
      "Lee remains a prominent but controversial figure in K-pop history. His label pioneered the industry\u2019s intensive training system, recruiting performers as young as elementary school age and putting them through years of rigorous preparation. Some of his artists have challenged their contracts as unfair, sparking broader debates about industry practices.",
      "The recognition arrives as Lee reemerges into the spotlight after a contentious, high-profile departure from the agency he founded in 1995 \u2014 a management battle that included a public feud with his nephew-in-law and a bidding war over his shares. He\u2019s been keeping busy since, debuting a new band, A2O MAY, in both China and the U.S. He's also investing in a boutique Chinese firm\u2019s high-tech production technologies.",
      "Born in South Korea, Lee studied computer engineering in the U.S. for his master's degree. That technical background would later inform his approach to everything from visualization and cutting-edge production technologies \u2014 he said he\u2019s been rewatching \"The Matrix\u201d to revisit filming techniques \u2014 to pioneering elaborate \u201cworldviews\u201d and virtual avatars for his K-pop bands.",
      "For Lee, the Hall of Fame honor \u201cconfirms that K-pop has become a genre that the mainstream is now paying attention to\u201d \u2014 an acceptance that came after costly lessons and years of trial and error.",
      "Lee invested about $5 million in BoA\u2019s 2009 American debut with \u201cEat You Up,\u201d one of the first songs by a South Korean artist to be primarily written and produced by Western producers \u2014 a bold early attempt to bring K-pop into the U.S. mainstream. But with few widely recognized Asian artists in American pop culture at the time, the market wasn\u2019t ready. After nearly two years, BoA \u2014 already a megastar in Korea and Japan \u2014 decided to return home. The experience, Lee has said, left him with lasting regrets.",
      "\u201cWhen I asked the songwriter(s) to revise \u2018Eat You Up,\u2019 they refused,\u201d Lee recalled. \u201cIf we had changed it, I believe it would have achieved much better results.\u201d",
      "That setback taught Lee that K-pop needed to source global talent while maintaining creative control to adapt songs for the worldwide market. His quest for the perfect tracks took him worldwide.",
      "\u201cI once heard a song that was so good I couldn\u2019t let it go,\u201d he said, recalling the track that would later become \u201cDreams Come True\u201d for S.E.S., the late-1990s girl group. \u201cI could\u2019ve bought the license to the song in South Korea, Hong Kong, or Sweden. But I wanted to play it safe, so I found the Finnish address, went to meet the songwriter directly, wrote up a contract, and brought it back.\u201d",
      "At the time, top Western songwriters prioritized Japan, the world\u2019s second-largest music market. \u201cEuropean songwriters were willing to sell to Asia,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cThat\u2019s how we eventually built a system where music from Europe, Asia, and America could come together.\u201d",
      "That fusion became K-pop\u2019s signature. Lee also helped to pioneer another innovation: elaborate fictional universes, or \u201cworldviews,\u201d for groups like EXO and aespa \u2014 a storytelling approach that would later be adopted across the industry, including by groups like BTS.",
      "The concept emerged during his time in the U.S., where he witnessed MTV transform music into a visual medium. \u201cBut we only have three or four minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we express dramatic, cinematic elements in such a short time?\u201d",

      "The documentary also addressed darker aspects of K-pop close to Lee\u2019s heart, including the suicides of SM Entertainment artists.",
      "He traces the problem to anonymous and malicious online comments that often evade accountability, especially when posted on servers outside South Korea\u2019s jurisdiction, calling it a global issue requiring international cooperation. Lee advocates for worldwide standards on user verification and mediation systems where victims could identify attackers without expensive legal battles.",
      "But Lee resists the media\u2019s focus on K-pop\u2019s problems. \u201cShould we always weigh the dark side equally with the bright side, the future?\u201d he asked. \u201cMedia should consider whether K-pop represents more future or more past that holds us back. Rather than just discussing the dark side and dragging us down by clinging to the past, shouldn\u2019t we talk more about the future?\u201d",
      "After more than three decades, Lee\u2019s definition remains straightforward: \u201cK-pop is a new language of communication that transcends barriers. These languages move around naturally \u2014 what you can\u2019t stop is culture.\u201d",

      "No one is bigger than the monarchy",
      "No one is bigger than the monarchy. Not even the king\u2019s brother.",
      "In the end, that reality spelled the end of Andrew\u2019s life as a prince of the realm.",
      "As details of Andrew\u2019s links to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein continued to dribble out and Parliament raised questions about his rent-free residence at a sprawling country house near Windsor Castle, King Charles III moved Thursday to shield the monarchy from any further revelations.",
      "In a statement issued by Buckingham Palace, the king said he had taken steps to strip his brother of all his titles and honors, including the one he has held since birth \u2014 prince. From now on, the scandal-plagued British royal will be known simply as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.",
      "Andrew is also being forced to move out of Royal Lodge, the 30-room mansion near Windsor Castle where he has lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\u201cThe monarchy needed to draw the thickest line they could between Andrew and the rest of the royal family,\u2019\u2019 said Craig Prescott, an expert on constitutional law and the monarchy at Royal Holloway, University of London. \u201cAnd he\u2019s precisely done that.\u201d",
      "The king\u2019s decision came after the announcement earlier this month that Andrew had agreed to stop using the titles failed to stanch the flood of tawdry stories that threaten to weaken support for the monarchy. Far from ending the media frenzy, the earlier move spurred calls from some members of Parliament that Andrew be formally stripped of his titles and evicted from Royal Lodge.",
      "That raised the prospect of a parliamentary debate on Andrew\u2019s conduct that would have subjected the royal family to even more unwanted publicity.",
      "Andrew\u2019s disgrace comes as Charles, who is 76 and undergoing treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer, works to resolve stubborn problems and buttress the foundations of the monarchy for his elder son, Prince William, to inherit.",
      "\u201cThis, I think, was a very clear statement of what had to be done to get the house in order (now) and also going forward for the future,\u201d said George Gross, a royal expert at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThat makes life easier for Prince William \u2026 I think that\u2019s also part of it. But it felt inevitable.\u201d",
      "While the king\u2019s decision may help shield the monarchy from the fallout from the scandal, it won\u2019t end Andrew\u2019s problems.",
      "The latest round of stories about Andrew was triggered by the publication of a memoir written by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that she was trafficked by Epstein and had sex with Andrew when she was 17. Giuffre, an American living in Australia, took her own life earlier this year.",
      "Her brother, Sky Roberts, on Thursday lauded his sister\u2019s long fight to expose Epstein and Andrew, but continued to call for the king\u2019s brother to be prosecuted.",

      "He has been the subject of tabloid stories stretching back to at least 2007, when he sold a house near Windsor Castle for 20% over the 15 million pound asking price. The buyer was reported to be Timur Kulibayev, son-in-law of Nursultan Nazarbayev, then-president of Kazakhstan, raising concerns that the deal was an attempt to buy influence in Britain.",
      "Those allegations, coupled with reported links to a son of former Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, led to Andrew being stripped of his role as Britain\u2019s special envoy for international trade and investment.",
      "But royal experts believe Andrew was often shielded from the full weight of his scandals because of his position as the queen\u2019s favorite child.",
      "That became untenable in November 2019, after Andrew gave a disastrous interview to the BBC in an effort to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein. He was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein\u2019s victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier.",
      "Soon after the interview aired, Andrew was forced to give up all of his public duties and charity roles.",
      "Now Charles is severing his brother\u2019s remaining ties to the institution of the monarchy. The Royal Lodge has been a particularly sore point, with Andrew until now rejecting the king\u2019s entreaties to give up his 75-year lease on the property. He will now live at the king's private estate at Sandringham in eastern England.",
      "Prescott, the constitutional expert, said Andrew\u2019s banishment should be seen as part of a transition in the monarchy that began after Elizabeth\u2019s death in 2022.",
      "As long as the queen was alive, people were reluctant to criticize the monarchy because it was seen as personally criticizing the queen, who became a revered figure during her 70-year reign.",
      "Charles has never had that same status and he recognizes that the crown has to be accountable to the people and their representatives in Parliament, Prescott said.",
      "\u201cThis is part of the transition of the monarchy becoming more like a typical public institution, capable of being scrutinized by Parliament in one way or another,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "Florence Welch explores her desire for greatness and the constraints she faces as a female artist in Florence + the Machine's sixth album, \"Everybody Scream.\"",
      "During his acceptance speech for best actor at this year\u2019s Screen Actors Guild Awards, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet made known his desire to be remembered as \u201cone of the greats.\u201d A few years earlier, Chalamet starred in Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of \u201cLittle Women,\u201d in which his character demonstratively asks his future wife, \u201cWhat women are allowed into the club of geniuses, anyway?\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody Scream,\u201d Florence + the Machine\u2019s sixth album, is a response to that familiar, gendered notion. Across its 12 tracks, Florence Welch contends with both her desire for greatness and the constraints she understands to have been put on her as a female artist.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Welch had Chalamet\u2019s viral speech in mind when writing, \u201cOne of the Greats,\u201d the album\u2019s lead single. But what is apparent in her brooding feminist treatise are grievances about sexism and male entitlement. \u201cIt must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can,\u201d she belts over gothic synths and strings. But it's a bit funny, too: \"Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a fan, you\u2019re my second favorite frontman.\u201d",
      "Welch collaborated with Mark Bowen of IDLES for much of the record, as well as Mitski and Aaron Dessner of The National. Sometimes the collaborations create a haunting sound, but most of \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is packed with the band's signature orchestral pop, an ornate arrangement of strings, synths, guitars, pianos and percussion.",
      "Perhaps to a fault, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d isn\u2019t sonically dissimilar from what fans of Florence + the Machine have come to expect. But in a lyrical shift, Welch meditates heavily on mysticism and witchcraft throughout, something she turned to after suffering a nearly fatal ectopic pregnancy in 2023. The 39-year-old later revealed that she performed with a burst fallopian tube during her last tour and had to undergo emergency surgery.",
      "\u201cI sit in salt water/Call in a vision of my daughter/Light a candle/Place my grief upon the altar,\u201d her voice vibrates over haunting background vocals and an eerie electric guitar on \u201cYou Can Have It All.\u201d",
      "The record is reminiscent of Halsey\u2019s 2021 concept album, \u201cIf I Can\u2019t Have Love, I Want Power,\u201d where femininity and motherhood are juxtaposed with influence, respect and violence.",
      "There\u2019s a similar rawness to Welch\u2019s poetry, as she grapples with mortality and ambition. But, like life, it\u2019s also accompanied by the mundane. \u201cDownloading \u2018Revelations of Divine Love\u2019 on my phone/Trying to read but getting distracted/Trying to live but feeling so damaged,\u201d she sings on \u201cPerfume and Milk,\u201d one of the more austere songs on the album.",
      "As a concept, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is stellar. There\u2019s a sonic and thematic unity to the album and its Halloween release makes perfect sense.",

      "Former Vice President Dick Cheney battled heart disease for most of his adult life, a life extended thanks in part to a heart transplant in 2012.",
      "Cheney, who died Monday due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, had his first heart attack at the unusually young age of 37. He would go on to survive four more before his heart declined enough to qualify for that transplant.",
      "Heart disease is the nation's No. 1 killer and Cheney's decades of health problems illustrate how heart trouble can accumulate \u2014 as well as the varied treatments.",
      "Over the years, Cheney underwent quadruple bypass surgery to reroute blood flow around clogged heart arteries as well as less invasive artery-clearing angioplasties. He had a pacemaker implanted to monitor his heartbeat. He also experienced blood vessel problems in his legs.",
      "Heart attacks damage the heart's muscle, eventually making it harder to pump properly. After Cheney's fifth heart attack in 2010, he acknowledged \u201cincreasing congestive heart failure.\u201d He received another implant, a small pump called a \u201cleft ventricular assist device\u201d or LVAD. That device took over the job of his heart's main pumping chamber, powered by batteries worn in a fanny pack.",

      "Then in March 2012, at the age of 71, Cheney received a heart transplant. Like him, more than 70% of heart transplant recipients live at least five years, many longer. Cheney was older than a typical heart transplant recipient; most are 50 to 64 years old. But he was one of 362 people age 65 or older who received a new heart in 2012, according to the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, or OPTN.",
      "There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure yet many are never placed on the transplant list, in part because of the organ shortage. According to the organ network, 4,572 people received a heart transplant last year. That number of has grown gradually since Cheney's \u2014 there were 2,378 transplants in 2012. So have the number of recipients 65 or older \u2014 905 last year.",

Kennedy Jr. and his deputies against a chemical that is a mainstay of dental care.",
      "The FDA said that the products are no longer recommended for children younger than 3 and those who are older but don't face serious risks of tooth decay. Previously, the products have been prescribed for children as young as six months.",

      "The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for educators, wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for school leaders wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws. For Education Secretary Linda McMahon, it offers a preview of what she hopes to make permanent.",
      "Much of the department\u2019s work has gone completely cold. No new grants are being awarded, and civil rights investigations have been halted. Money is still flowing for key programs, but in many respects, schools and states are on their own.",
      "That\u2019s the vision President Donald Trump has promoted since his presidential campaign \u2014 a world where states fully have the reins of education policy with little or no influence from the federal government.",
      "Even before the shutdown, mass layoffs had left the agency with 2,400 employees, down from 4,100 when Trump took office. Remaining workers have mostly been furloughed during the budget impasse, leaving some 330 who are responsible for carrying out duties that are deemed essential.",
      "In a recent social media post, McMahon said the shutdown proves her department is unnecessary. \u201cTwo weeks in, millions of American students are still going to school, teachers are getting paid, and schools are operating as normal,\u201d McMahon wrote.",
      "She offered a more direct assessment days later, after the agency hit its 46th year: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a birthday cake,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe need an eviction notice.\u201d",
      "Some say the shutdown's impact has been more significant. They warn that funding for preschool centers and school meals is running out, and students with disabilities might not be getting the help they need.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the impact so far.",
      "Most of the billions of dollars the Education Department steers to schools each year went out the door in October, leaving schools funded until July.",
      "Other programs that aren\u2019t funded in advance face more uncertainty. That includes federally funded Head Start preschool centers and school nutrition programs funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said Julia Martin, director of policy and government affairs at the Bruman Group, an education law firm.",
      "Districts are required to cover the cost of school meals and then seek reimbursement from the Department of Agriculture, but the agency said it only has two months of reimbursements left amid the shutdown.",
      "\u201cDistricts are really worried that they\u2019re going to have to dig deep into their pockets to fund meals,\u201d Martin said.",
      "The last remnants of federal COVID-19 aid are still being released by the Education Department, but reimbursements have slowed with fewer staff reviewing the requests, Martin said.",
      "America\u2019s public schools are primarily funded by states and cities, but federal funding plays an important role. The billions sent already to schools include grants to help low-income students, those with disabilities and other populations.",
      "Grant competitions to award smaller amounts of money have largely frozen. Schools and states that already received grants can keep spending them down, but all new grantmaking has ceased, the department said. At the college level, federal Pell grants for low-income students are still flowing, and the FAFSA financial aid form is still being processed.",
      "Ordinarily, states and schools rely on the department to answer questions on a wide range of topics \u2014 from special education laws to statewide academic assessments to laws requiring public schools to provide certain services to students at private schools.",

      "That work, known as technical assistance, has halted during the shutdown, and the Trump administration has moved to eliminate it almost entirely. A new round of layoffs this month targeted most workers in the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education.",
      "Also gutted was the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which ensures that students with disabilities get the services they\u2019re entitled to under federal law. It maintains \u201cvery regular\u201d communication with states to field questions on coordinating aid to families and eliminating waitlists, said Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, a disability rights group.",
      "The new layoffs have been halted by a federal judge. But as the shutdown drags on, more states are likely to break federal laws unknowingly because they can\u2019t get help from the government, said Neas, who led the special education office under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cPeople of good intention and good faith are going to have honest questions that they're not going to be able to get an answer for,\u201d Neas said.",
      "Some states have turned instead to law firms for advice, but there are not always clear answers. In August, the department rescinded 2015 guidance explaining schools\u2019 legal obligations to students who are learning English. But with no new guidance replacing it before the government shutdown, schools have questions about their responsibilities, said Martin, of the Bruman law firm.",
      "\u201cIn the meantime, a lot of districts are just going to continue to follow the old guidance because it\u2019s the best thing they have,\u201d Martin said.",
      "McMahon has acknowledged that only Congress can fully eliminate the Education Department, despite Trump's campaign pledge to shut it down. As a workaround, officials have been developing plans to transfer core functions to other agencies.",
      "The Education Department already moved some of its adult and career education programs to the Labor Department in July. The Labor Department now oversees federal Perkins grants, which go to states to fund career and technical education.",

      "The new deaths were reported in Hawaii and Oregon, the CDC said. Previous deaths were reported in Illinois, Michigan, Texas and Utah. One person who became ill was pregnant and it resulted in the death of a fetus.",
      "The outbreak has been traced to precooked pasta produced by Nate's Fine Foods of Roseville, California. In September, the company recalled nearly 245,000 pounds (111,130 kilograms) of pasta, including cases of linguine, fettuccine, penne and other products sold to large producers of heat-and-eat meals and pasta salads.",

      "MINOOKA, Ill. -- Bill Swick has a rare degenerative brain disease that inhibits his mobility and speech. Instead of the hassle of traveling an hour to a clinic in downtown Chicago to visit a speech therapist, he has benefited from virtual appointments from the comfort of his home.",
      "But Swick, 53, hasn\u2019t had access to those appointments for the last month.",
      "The federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, halted funding for the Medicare telehealth program that pays his provider for her services. So, Swick and his wife are practicing old strategies rather than learning new skills to manage his growing difficulties with processing language, connecting words and pacing himself while speaking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because we want to continue with his journey, with his progress,\u201d 45-year-old Martha Swick, a caregiver for her husband since his diagnosis three years ago, said during an interview at their home in Minooka, Illinois. \u201cI try to have all his therapy and everything organized for him, to make his day easier and smoother, and then everything has a hitch, and we have to stop and wait.\u201d",

      "With Congress unable to agree on a deal to fund the government, the waivers have lapsed, even with support from Republicans and Democrats. As a result, medical providers are deciding whether they can continue offering telehealth services without the guarantee of reimbursement or whether they need to halt virtual visits altogether.",
      "That\u2019s left a patient population of mostly older adults with fewer options to seek specialists or get help when they can\u2019t physically travel far from home.",
      "Swick, whose corticobasal degeneration causes symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, can\u2019t feed or dress himself anymore and struggles with balance and walking. Add on the logistical nightmare of driving to the city in traffic, and in-person speech therapy appointments aren\u2019t a worthwhile ordeal for him and his wife.",

      "It \u201cfeels like you\u2019re taking a step back,\u201d Swick said in the interview.",
      "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Medicare only paid for virtual medical appointments under narrow circumstances, including in designated rural areas and when patients logged in from eligible sites, like hospitals and clinics.",
      "That changed in 2020, when Trump\u2019s first administration dramatically expanded telehealth coverage in response to the public health emergency. Medicare started reimbursing a wide range of telehealth visits, stripping the geographic requirement, and allowing patients to take calls from their homes.",
      "Congress has routinely extended the telehealth flexibilities and was poised to do so again before their Sept. 30 expiration. But when budget negotiations stalled and the government shut down Oct. 1, the vote never happened, leaving the program temporarily unfunded.",

      "The European Union has announced plans to slash carbon emissions by 90% by 2040",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union said Wednesday it would slash carbon emissions by 90% by 2040, in an agreement widely seen as a weakening of the 27-nation bloc's previous climate goals, after an overnight debate ahead of the U.N. climate conference in Brazil.",
      "Hungary, Slovakia and Poland voted against the agreement, despite other nations agreeing to key compromises including allowing flexibility for member states to buy carbon credits internationally to reach their emissions targets and for the EU to reassess its climate policy depending on economic performance. The agreement also allows for postponing a new carbon trading plan covering transport and heating, a central demand of Poland.",
      "Environmentalists criticized the deal for provisions that will allow the EU to buy carbon credits from less-developed countries, effectively outsourcing the bloc's obligations. \u201cThe use of offshore carbon laundering to meet this nominal target means the EU\u2019s own commitment is much lower, and that commitment means even less with a baked-in clause to dilute the target every two years,\u201d said Greenpeace EU climate campaigner Thomas Gelin. Jeroen Gerlag, Europe director at the nonprofit Climate Group, said that \u201cwhile the EU keeps its 90% commitment on paper, in effect it\u2019ll be offshoring some of its emission reductions \u2013 making it someone else\u2019s problem.\u201d",
      "The agreement was hammered out between EU climate ministers in a marathon session overnight into Wednesday morning. Before it becomes a legally-binding document, the European Parliament will vote on it and negotiate its contents with the European Council.",
      "\u201cThis is exactly the signal that Europe has to send in these times,\u201d said Swedish climate minister Romina Pourmokhtari, who thanked Finland, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands for pushing for high emissions cuts in the debate.",

      "Modern-day promoters emphasize that the yodel is far more than the mountain cries of yesteryear by falsetto-bellowing male herders in suspenders who intone alongside giant alphorn instruments atop verdant hillsides. It\u2019s now a popular form of singing.",
      "Over the last century, yodeling clubs sprouted up in Switzerland, building upon the tradition and broadening its appeal \u2014 with its tones, techniques and tremolos finding their way deeper into the musical lexicon internationally in classical, jazz and folk. U.S. country crooners prominently blended yodels into their songs in the late 1920s and 30s.",

We have a fifth: The yodel,\" said Nadja R\u00e4ss, a professor at the university, alluding to the official German, French, Italian and Romansh languages in Switzerland. Yodeling exists in neighboring Austria, Germany and Italy, but Swiss yodeling is distinctive because of its vocal technique, she said.",
      "In its early days, yodeling involved chants of wordless vowel sounds, or \u201cnatural yodeling,\u201d with melodies but no lyrics. More recently, \u201cyodeling song\u201d has included verses and a refrain.",
      "The Swiss government says at least 12,000 yodelers take part through about 780 groups of the Swiss Yodeling Association.",
      "In Switzerland, R\u00e4ss said, yodeling is built on the \u201csound colors of the voice\u201d and features two types: one centering on the head \u2014 with a \u201cu\u201d sound \u2014 and one emanating from deeper down in the chest \u2014 with an \u201co\u201d sound.",
      "And even within Switzerland, styles vary: Yodeling in the northern region near Appenzell is more \u201cmelancholic, slower,\u201d while in the country's central regions, the sounds are \u201cmore intense and shorter,\u201d she said.",
      "What began as mostly a male activity is now drawing more women in a country that adopted universal suffrage in 1971. The Appenzell-Innerrhoden region only gave equal voting rights to women in local elections in 1990, following a high court ruling.",

The crew was on its way to provide humanitarian help to provinces battered by Kalmaegi, the military said. It did not give the cause of the crash.",

      "Brazil\u2019s leader, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, says he wants the future of the Amazon rainforest to be built around a major fund that will pay countries to keep their forests standing",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on Tuesday put forward his vision for how the Amazon rainforest should be protected, a future that didn't depend on donations from wealthy nations and large philanthropies but instead included a major fund that paid countries to keep forests standing.",
      "\u201cI don't want to say the word donation any longer,\u201d Lula told reporters ahead of the United Nations\u2019 climate summit, known as COP30, which begins this week in Belem, a Brazilian city in the edge of the Amazon.",
      "\u201cSomeone gives us $50 million. It is nice, but that\u2019s nothing,\" he said. \"We need billions to deal with our problems, problems of people who are (living) there.\u201d",
      "In Belem, Lula is expected to launch an initiative named Tropical Forests Forever Fund, aiming to support more than 70 developing countries that commit to preservation. So far, Colombia, Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia and Malaysia have joined.",
      "Germany, the United Arab Emirates, France, Norway, and the United Kingdom are helping shape the mechanism and likely will be its first investors, which Lula hopes will help boost interest from the private sector. Brazil's president did not provide more details about how the plan would come to action.",
      "The official COP30 website describes the initiative as a \u201cpermanent trust fund\u201d that would generate about $4 from the private sector for every $1 contributed. How that would happen wasn't immediately clear. However, forests can generate money in various ways beyond extracting resources, such as tourism and carbon offsets, which can involve companies paying to cancel out their pollution by planting trees and protecting forests.",
      "If the initiative works, resources will be sent to countries that keep their tropical forests.",
      "\u201cBrazil has already invested $1 billion, and this will bring revenue to investors,\u201d Lula added. \u201cIt is a win-win fund. We hope that when we finish the TFFF presentation many countries join.\u201d",

The biodiverse area is home to little-studied mangroves and a coral reef. Activists and experts have said the project risks leaks that could be carried widely by tides and imperil the sensitive environment. Petrobras has long argued it has never caused spills in its drillings.",
      "\u201cIf I was a fake and lying leader, I would wait for COP to be finished (to give approval),\" Lula said. \u201cBut if I did that I would be a small man before the importance of this.\u201d",
      "Lula, Brazil's president for two terms early in the 2000s before returning for a third term in 2023, has long cast himself as both a steward of the environment and pragmatic. Brazil is a major oil exporting country, and revenues brought in by Petrobras help fund any government's agenda. At the same time, Lula's administration has worked to curb deforestation and take a leading role in climate negotiations by hosting the summit.",
      "\u201cI don't want to be an environmental leader. I never claimed to be,\u201d Lula added. \u201cI want to do the right things that specialists, my administration and my conscience say we have to do.

      "JUBA, South Sudan -- No food aid has reached a conflict-hit area of South Sudan this year despite growing fears that it is headed toward famine, international food security analysts said Tuesday.",
      "The report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global monitor, estimates that 28,000 people in Nasir and Fangak counties face \u201ccatastrophic food insecurity,\u201d the most severe level of hunger.",
      "\u201cAn immediate and large-scale response\u201d is required, it says.",
      "Both counties have been historically controlled by the SPLM-IO opposition party led by suspended First Vice President Riek Machar.",
      "Machar has been charged with treason and other crimes that he denies over an attack by a local militia on a military garrison in Nasir that South Sudan's government says killed 250 soldiers. Government-led military operations, including dozens of aerial bombardments, have targeted opposition forces and allied militias in Nasir throughout much of the year.",
      "After months of clashes, Nasir is now effectively partitioned between the opposition, which controls large swathes of the county, and government forces. Heavy fighting and airstrikes have displaced tens of thousands of people into dozens of informal sites along the Sobat river, a major Nile tributary.",
      "The violence, which has only recently calmed, has presented a major obstacle for aid groups to deliver food.",
      "Mary-Ellen McGroarty, the South Sudan director for the World Food Program, said in an emailed statement that fighting and access restrictions had \u201csignificantly limited\u201d the ability to reach areas of eastern Nasir county along the Sobat corridor since February.",
      "But McGroarty said a WFP-led mission last month had verified the location of civilians and secured access assurances from authorities. \u201cThis will be our first time reaching these populations this year,\u201d she said.",
      "Lam Paul Gabriel, a SPLM-IO spokesperson, accused the government of blocking the flow of aid into opposition-controlled areas to punish civilians living there and encourage movement into government-controlled zones.",
      "But Stephen Kueth, chairperson of South Sudan\u2019s Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, denied that aid groups had been blocked.",

      "Famine declarations are rare. The last famine in South Sudan was declared in 2017 during the country\u2019s civil war.",
      "Now, more than half the country's population is expected to face severe hunger in 2026, according to the IPC.",

      "Full-size three-row SUVs can fulfill many needs, with room for more than five passengers, a large cargo area, and the ability to pull a heavy trailer",
      "Let\u2019s say you need a vehicle with room for more than five passengers, a large cargo area, and the ability to pull a heavy trailer. A full-size three-row SUV should work well, but which one? The most significant news this year is the redesigned Ford Expedition. Ford has given its biggest SUV a complete makeover with a more upscale interior, new technology features and a novel split-opening tailgate.",
      "It\u2019s a compelling pick for a big SUV, but it\u2019s not the only one vying for your attention. The GMC Yukon got its own refresh for 2025. It\u2019s not as comprehensive as the Expedition\u2019s, but it too features a significant interior and technology overhaul that further distances it from its mechanical twin, the Chevy Tahoe. Edmunds\u2019 auto experts tested both to determine which one is the better buy.",
      "The Expedition has a turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 in two versions. The standard-output V6 produces 400 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque, while the high-output version pumps out 440 horsepower and 510 lb-ft. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 19 mpg combined with standard rear-wheel drive and 18 mpg combined with optional four-wheel drive.",
      "The Yukon\u2019s engine choices are an interesting contrast. The standard 5.3-liter V8 produces 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft, while the 6.2-liter V8 standard on top trim levels has a more competitive 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft. Fuel economy is up to 17 mpg combined for the 5.3-liter V8; the 6.2-liter gets 16 mpg combined.",
      "At the Edmunds test track, an Expedition with the high-output V6 accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. That\u2019s a second quicker than the Yukon with its bigger V8. The Yukon does have an efficiency ace up its sleeve, however. You can get an optional turbodiesel six-cylinder that makes 305 horsepower and 495 lb-ft and gets up to an EPA-estimated 23 mpg combined.",
      "Space and towing",
      "Third-row space is exceptional in both, especially for tall teens or adults. On paper, though, the Expedition has a slight advantage with its 36.5 inches of third-row legroom compared to the Yukon\u2019s 34.9 inches.",
      "Their respective specs also indicate the Yukon has more cargo space. However, in Edmunds\u2019 testing, Ford\u2019s full-size SUV could hold more pieces of luggage behind its third row seat. Specifically, the cargo area is wider back there.",
      "For really big gear hauling, the Expedition can tow a maximum of 9,600 pounds. The Yukon maxes out at 8,400 pounds.",
      "Advantage: Ford Expedition",
      "Both of these SUVs are well-suited for big families. There are subtle differences, however. The Expedition\u2019s greatest strength is undoubtedly space. There\u2019s ample room for passengers in every seat, and the seats are comfortable, especially for the driver and front passenger. We like them better than the Yukon\u2019s front seats for comfort on long drives. We\u2019ve also found that the Expedition has less wind and road noise on the highway than the Yukon.",

      "Most SUVs based on trucks are subject to undue vibrations and reverberations throughout the cabin, but the Expedition keeps those to a minimum. It also has a smooth ride over bumps and ruts. The Yukon offers an optional adaptive air suspension that can adjust the SUV\u2019s ride height and automatically soften the shock absorbers to help smooth out the ride even further, but overall we\u2019ve found the Expedition more relaxing and comfortable to drive.",
      "Advantage: Ford Expedition",
      "The GMC Yukon has a distinctive 16.8-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen that features a Google-based operating system. The Google integration provides the familiarity of Google Maps and other Google features, such as the voice-based Assistant app. There is an 11-inch digital instrument panel as well with customizable layouts and information. This is a very good tech package that Edmunds rates highly for its functionality and feature content.",
      "That said, we rate the Expedition\u2019s system even higher. It consists of a 13.2-inch touchscreen interface that works in concert with an enormous 24-inch ultra-wide dash-top screen that acts as a combination instrument panel and customizable secondary display for the touchscreen. These screens are bright and easy to read and don\u2019t feel like tech for tech\u2019s sake \u2014 they actually improve functionality.",
      "Both SUVs offer hands-free highway driving assist technology: GMC\u2019s is called Super Cruise and Ford\u2019s is called BlueCruise. Both are effective and reliable, and if either enjoys the slightest advantage, it\u2019s the GMC thanks to its light-up steering wheel that makes it perfectly obvious when the system is operating or needs your attention.",
      "Advantage: Ford Expedition",
      "While the Yukon is luxurious, comfortable and packed with impressive technology features, the Ford Expedition quite simply outdoes it in most respects. It also boasts multiple high-end trim levels that easily hold their own against the top trims of the Yukon for luxury appeal.",

      "Three lower courts have ruled illegal President Donald Trump\u2019s use of emergency powers to impose sweeping worldwide tariffs",
      "WASHINGTON -- Three lower courts have ruled illegal President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to impose worldwide tariffs. Now the Supreme Court, with three justices Trump appointed and generally favorable to muscular presidential power, will have the final word.",
      "In roughly two dozen emergency appeals, the justices have largely gone along with Trump in temporarily allowing parts of his aggressive second-term agenda to take effect while lawsuits play out.",
      "But the case being argued Wednesday is the first in which the court will render a final decision on a Trump policy. The stakes are enormous, both politically and financially.",
      "Trump has made tariffs a central piece of his economic and foreign policy, and has said it would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d if the Supreme Court rules against him.",
      "Here are some things to know about the tariffs arguments at the Supreme Court:",
      "They are paid by companies that import finished products or parts, and the added cost can be passed on to consumers.",
      "Through September, the government has reported collecting $195 billion in revenue generated from the tariffs.",
      "The Constitution gives Congress the power to impose tariffs, but Trump has claimed extraordinary power to act without congressional approval by declaring national emergencies under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "In February, he invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that the illegal flow of immigrants and drugs across the U.S. border amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.",
      "In April, he imposed worldwide tariffs after declaring the United States\u2019 longstanding trade deficits \u201ca national emergency.\u201d",
      "Challengers to Trump's actions won rulings from a specialized trade court, a district judge in Washington and a business-focused appeals court, also in the nation's capital.",
      "Those courts found that Trump could not justify tariffs under the emergency powers law, which doesn't mention them. But they left the tariffs in place in the meantime.",
      "The appeals court relied on \u201c major questions,\u201d a legal doctrine devised by the Supreme Court that requires Congress to speak clearly on issues of \u201cvast economic and political significance.\u201d",
      "Conservative majorities struck down three separate initiatives related to the coronavirus pandemic. The court ended a pause on evictions, blocked a vaccine mandate for large businesses and prevented student loan forgiveness that would have totaled $500 billion over 10 years.",

      "In comparison, the stakes in the tariff case are much higher. The taxes are estimated to generate $3 trillion over 10 years.",
      "The challengers in the tariffs case have cited writings by the three Trump appointees, Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, in calling on the court to apply similar limitations on a signal Trump policy.",
      "Barrett described a babysitter taking children on roller coasters and spending a night in a hotel based on a parent's encouragement to \u201cmake sure the kids have fun.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the normal course, permission to spend money on fun authorizes a babysitter to take children to the local ice cream parlor or movie theater, not on a multiday excursion to an out-of-town amusement park,\u201d Barrett wrote in the student loans case. \"If a parent were willing to greenlight a trip that big, we would expect much more clarity than a general instruction to \u2018make sure the kids have fun.\u2019\u201d",
      "Kavanaugh, though, has suggested the court should not apply the same limiting standard to foreign policy and national security issues.",
      "A dissenting appellate judge also wrote that Congress purposely gave presidents more latitude to act through the emergency powers law.",
      "Some of the businesses that sued also are raising a separate legal argument in an appeal to conservative justices, saying that Congress could not constitutionally delegate its taxing power to the president.",
      "The so-called nondelegation principle has not been used in 90 years, since the Supreme Court struck down some New Deal legislation.",
      "But Gorsuch authored a dissent in June that would have found the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s universal service fee an unconstitutional delegation. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas joined the dissent.",
      "\u201cWhat happens when Congress, weary of the hard business of legislating and facing strong incentives to pass the buck, cedes its lawmaking power, clearly and unmistakably, to an executive that craves it?\u201d Gorsuch wrote.",
      "The court only agreed to hear the case in September, scheduling arguments less than two months later. The quick turnaround, at least by Supreme Court standards, suggests that the court will try to act fast.",
      "High-profile cases can take a half year or more to resolve, often because the majority and dissenting opinions go through rounds of revision.",
      "But the court can act quickly when deadline pressure dictates. Most recently, the court ruled a week after hearing arguments in the TikTok case, unanimously upholding a law requiring the popular social media app to be banned unless it was sold by its Chinese parent company. Trump has intervened several times to keep the law from taking effect while negotiations continue with China.",

      "The Constitution says Congress has the power to levy tariffs. But the Trump administration argues that in emergency situations the president can regulate importation taxes like tariffs. Trump has called the case one of the most important in the country\u2019s history and said a ruling against him would be catastrophic for the economy.",
      "The challengers argue the 1977 emergency powers law Trump used doesn\u2019t even mention tariffs, and no president before has used it to impose them. A collection of small businesses say the uncertainty is driving them to the brink of bankruptcy.",
      "The case centers on two sets of tariffs. The first came in February on imports from Canada, China and Mexico after Trump declared a national emergency over drug trafficking. The second involves the sweeping \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on most countries that Trump announced in April.",
      "Multiple lawsuits have been filed over the tariffs, and the court will hear suits filed by Democratic-leaning states and small businesses focused on everything from plumbing supplies to women's cycling apparel.",
      "Lower courts have struck down the bulk of his tariffs as an illegal use of emergency power, but the nation\u2019s highest court may see it differently.",
      "Trump helped shape the conservative majority court, naming three of the justices in his first term. The justices have so far been reluctant to check his extraordinary flex of executive power, handing him a series of wins on its emergency docket.",
      "Still, those have been short-term orders \u2014 little of Trump\u2019s wide-ranging conservative agenda has been fully argued before the nation\u2019s highest court. That means the outcome could set the tone for wider legal pushback against his policies.",
      "The justices have been skeptical of executive power claims before, such as when then-President Joe Biden tried to forgive $400 billion in student loans under a different law dealing with national emergencies. The Supreme Court found the law didn\u2019t clearly give him the power to enact a program with such a big economic impact, a legal principle known as the major questions doctrine.",
      "The challengers say Trump\u2019s tariffs should get the same treatment, since they\u2019ll have a much greater economic effect, raising some $3 trillion over the next decade. The government, on the other hand, says the tariffs are different because they\u2019re a major part of his approach to foreign affairs, an area where the courts should not be second-guessing the president.",

None of us can manage missing two paychecks,\u2019\u201d Duffy said. \u201cSo if you bring us to a week from today, Democrats, you will see mass chaos. You will see mass flight delays.

The impact of the staff shortages could also be magnified if controllers coordinated a large effort to call out sick across a certain region of the country. Both the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and Duffy have urged controllers not to consider that and continue reporting to work.",
      "Mike McCormick, who used to oversee air traffic control for the FAA before he retired and is now a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said closing down part of the airspace and forcing planes to fly around an area is routinely done when there is a major thunderstorm. The FAA may also close down part of the airspace if it is short on controllers at one of its regional radar centers that directs planes flying at high altitude across the country. This move is very similar to a ground delay program that FAA uses at an airport when it is short on controllers there or encounters an equipment failure.",

Aviation analytics firm Cirium said that since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the total number of delays overall has not fallen significantly below that goal because most of the disruptions so far have been no worse than what happens when a major thunderstorm moves across an airport.",

      "As of midday Tuesday, there have been 1,932 flight delays reported across the United States, according to www.FlightAware.com. That is lower than what is typical although the FAA did say that flights in Phoenix were being delayed Tuesday morning because of staffing shortages.

      "Lambert, a critically endangered African penguin, has moved to a special geriatric island at the New England Aquarium in Boston",
      "BOSTON -- When Lambert started losing his vision and slowing down a few steps, it became clear that he needed to be relocated to a place where he could age safely and still be with his friends.",
      "But he couldn't be placed in just any nursing home \u2014 because he is a critically endangered African penguin. Instead, the New England Aquarium in Boston, where the 33-year-old Lambert was born and has lived his entire life, decided in February to open a geriatric island for him and its six other aging penguins.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it sort of started off as a joke. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, well, why don\u2019t we give them an old folks home?\u2019\u201d Eric Fox, associate curator of penguins at the aquarium, said. \u201cBut the more we were looking at their welfare data and understanding what ailments they go through, what physical limitations they have, we started to realize that we were on to something.\u201d",
      "The rocky island near the aquarium entrance is set apart from the rest of the 38-bird colony, ensuring the older penguins don't have to compete for territory with their often aggressive, younger peers. These penguins, with their trademark black and white feathers, stand about 2 feet (0.6 meters) tall and weigh about as much as a large house cat.",
      "The enclosure has some flatter topography and a carpeted path down to the water, which allows Lambert and the other penguins to better navigate up and down the island. The aquarium has built a stand in front of the island, which makes it easier for the penguins to hop out of the water.",
      "As a result, Mia Luzietti, a senior penguin trainer at the aquarium, said she has seen Lambert become more active since moving to the new island \u2014 swimming more with his mate and getting off the island more often.",
      "The concept was inspired by a larger concern that is confronting zoos and aquariums around the world \u2014 what to do when their animals are surviving far longer than their counterparts in the wild. In the case of these African penguins, some are in their 30s and one lived into its 40s. That is twice as long as they would live in the wilds of South Africa and Namibia, due to threats like pollution and lack of food from humans\u2019 overfishing.",
      "\u201cIt's really important that, as we learned how long these animals could live, if given an optimal environment, that we evolved with that,\u201d Luzietti said.",
      "\u201cSo learning on an individual level, how can we best set our animals up for success is really what led to the idea of creating our geriatric island, a place where our oldest penguins have a more comfortable, slower way of life as they live out their days here,\u201d she added.",

      "Caring for the aging penguins goes far beyond a safer enclosure.",
      "The older birds get more checkups than their younger counterparts, and veterinarians offer them treatment for ailments that might be familiar to older humans \u2014 such as supplements and anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis and joint pain, and eye drops for glaucoma. There are also more cameras around the island, so staff can better monitor the birds.",
      "\u201cWe are just keeping a little closer of an eye on some of these older birds,\u201d Luzietti said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re picking up on those \u2014 from how someone\u2019s hips are moving, how they\u2019re walking, how they are acting, if someone\u2019s squinting. The smallest change day to day can be hiding a really big secret.\u201d",
      "On a recent day, Luzietti was in the geriatric enclosure tending to Lambert \u2014 who seemed content to stand at the top of the island with his mate Dyer III, preening one another and occasionally letting out a loud call that sounded like a donkey's bray. He previously had his left eye removed due to an infection and has glaucoma in his right eye. He also suffers from chronic inflammation.",
      "Luzietti coaxed him down from his perch, and soon he was sitting on her lap, getting ready for his daily dose of eye drops.",
      "A crowd had formed around the enclosure to watch, including Terri Blessman, a 69-year-old tourist from Canton, Illinois, who was being pushed in a wheelchair by her friend Lou Ann Delost. Hearing about Lambert's age and the care he gets, Blessman said she could relate.",
      "\u201cThat's wonderful,\u201d Blessman said. \u201cAll of us older people need extra care as we get older.\u201d",

That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA.",

      "The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public.",
      "Three monkeys have remained on the loose since the crash on Tuesday in a rural area along Interstate 59, spilling wooden crates labeled \u201clive monkeys\u201d into the tall grass near the highway. Since then, searchers in masks, face shields and other protective equipment have scoured nearby fields and woods for the missing primates. Five of the 21 Rhesus macaques on board were killed during the search, according to the local sheriff, but it was unclear how that happened.",
      "Mississippi authorities have not disclosed the driver's name, the company involved in transporting the monkeys, where the monkeys were headed or who owns them. While Tulane University in New Orleans has acknowledged that the monkeys had been housed at its National Biomedical Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, it said it doesn't own them and won't identify who does.",
      "The questions surrounding the Mississippi crash and the mystery of why the animals were traveling through the South are remarkable, animal advocates say.",
      "\u201cWhen a truck carrying 21 monkeys crashes on a public highway, the community has a right to know who owned those animals, where they were being sent, and what diseases they may have been exposed to and harbored simply by being caught up in the primate experimentation industry,\u201d said Lisa Jones-Engel, senior science adviser on primate experimentation with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.",

      "\u201cTo the best of Tulane\u2019s knowledge, the 13 recovered animals remain in the possession of their owner and are en route to their original destination,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The crash has drawn a range of reactions \u2014 from conspiracy theories that suggest a government plot to sicken people to serious responses from people who oppose experimenting on animals.",

Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, set up traps to capture them. However, some spent two months that winter living in the woods and weathering a rare snowstorm. By late January, the last four escapees were recaptured after being lured back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.",

Kennedy International Airport in New York on a flight from Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation, authorities said. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all of the animals were accounted for within about a day, though three were euthanized for undisclosed reasons.",

      "GYEONGJU, South Korea -- Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia plans to supply hundreds of thousands of its graphics processing units for projects with South Korean businesses and the government to advance the country\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure and technologies.",
      "The plan was announced Friday by the government, Nvidia, and some of South Korea\u2019s biggest companies, including chipmakers Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and auto giant Hyundai Motor, after President Lee Jae Myung met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.",
      "At a news conference, Huang said he hopes to export Nvidia\u2019s most advanced AI chips to China, following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on loosening U.S. chip restrictions as the two leaders pledged to reduce trade tensions.",
      "However, he acknowledged that it was up to Trump to decide, and said there were no current plans to sell the next generation Blackwell chips to China.",
      "Huang has gotten rockstar treatment reminiscent of Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs since arriving in South Korea on Thursday to attend meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Gyeongju. As APEC host, South Korea is using the gathering of world leaders to showcase its ambitions in AI.",

      "About 50,000 of the GPUs will be used to support a government project to build a national cloud computing center for AI and Nvidia will provide the same number of GPUs each to Samsung and SK to help them enhance their manufacturing processes through AI and accelerate the development of advanced semiconductors.",
      "Hyundai and Nvidia said they plan to collaborate on developing technologies related to self-driving cars, smart factories and robotics, a process that will be powered by 50,000 of Nvidia\u2019s advanced Blackwell GPUs.",
      "Speaking to business leaders, Huang highlighted how AI and advanced computing are driving a profound transformation across industries, adding to the need for more infrastructure and capacity. South Korea\u2019s strengths in software, technical expertise and manufacturing give it an edge, he said.",
      "\u201cWhen you combine software, AI technology, and manufacturing, you have the opportunity to really take advantage of robotics,\u201d which is the future of AI, Huang said.",

      "Nvidia has argued that U.S. export controls hinder American competitiveness in one of the world\u2019s largest technology markets and warned that such limits could push other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology. Talking to reporters in South Korea, Huang said he hopes to eventually sell Blackwell chips to China, \u201cbut that\u2019s a decision for the president to make.\u201d",

And so I\u2019m hopeful that both governments will arrive at a conclusion someday where Nvidia\u2019s technology could be exported to China.\u201d",
      "Huang acknowledged U.S. security concerns about Nvidia technology being used by China\u2019s military but argued that China already has ample AI capabilities, making the use of Nvidia chips for military purposes largely unnecessary.",
      "In August, Trump announced a deal with Nvidia and AMD, another chipmaker, to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns among national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.",
      "Nvidia earlier this week confirmed that it has become the first $5 trillion company, just three months after the company broke through the $4 trillion mark. The milestone underscores the upheaval driven by the AI craze, widely seen as the biggest technological shift since Apple co-founder Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago.",

The tech executives clinked glasses, took bomb shots, and at one point, Huang stepped outside to hand baskets of chicken and fried cheese to the crowd waiting outside.",
      "The three later took the stage before hundreds of cheering fans at a nearby gaming festival, where Huang said Korea\u2019s gaming scene aided Nvidia\u2019s early success back when it mainly made graphics cards for gamers.",

That was slightly below the 8% increase in iPhone sales that had been anticipated by analysts, and less than the 13% bump in sales during the April-June period.",
      "Buoyed by the iPhone results, Apple earned $27.5 billion, or $1.85 per share, nearly doubling its profit from a year ago. Revenue climbed 8% from a year ago to $102.5 billion. Both the earnings and revenue eclipsed the analyst forecasts that steer the stock market.",

      "Apple had promised a wide array of AI features would be rolling out on last year\u2019s iPhone models, but was only able to deliver a few of them. The missing upgrades included a smarter and more versatile version of its frequently flummoxed Siri virtual assistant \u2013 a makeover that Apple now doesn\u2019t expect to complete until next year.",

      "Instead, it\u2019s a testing ground for tiny drones that can be deployed in search and rescue missions even in dark, smoky or stormy conditions.",
      "\u201cWe all know that when there\u2019s an earthquake or a tsunami, the first thing that goes down is power lines. A lot of times, it\u2019s at night, and you\u2019re not going to wait until the next morning to go and rescue survivors,\u201d said Nitin Sanket, assistant professor of robotics engineering. \u201cSo we started looking at nature. Is there a creature in the world which can actually do this?\u201d",
      "Sanket and his students found their answer in bats and the winged mammal's highly sophisticated ability to echolocate, or navigate via reflected sound. With a National Science Foundation grant, they\u2019re developing small, inexpensive and energy-efficient aerial robots that can be flown where and when current drones can\u2019t operate.",
      "Last month, emergency workers in Pakistan used drones to find people stranded on rooftops by massive floods. In August, a rescue team used a drone to find a California man who got trapped for two days behind a waterfall. And in July, drones helped find a stable route to three mine workers who spent more than 60 hours trapped underground in Canada.",
      "But while drones are becoming more common in search and rescue, Sanket and researchers elsewhere want to move beyond the manually operated individual robots being used today. A key next step is developing aerial robots that can be deployed in swarms and make their own decisions about where to search, said Ryan Williams, an associate professor at Virginia Tech.",
      "\u201cThat type of deployment \u2014 autonomous drones \u2014 that is effectively nil,\u201d he said.",
      "Williams tackled that problem with a recent project that involved programming drones to choose search trajectories in coordination with human searchers. Among other things, his team used historical data from thousands of missing person cases to create a model predicting how someone would behave if lost in the woods.",
      "\u201cAnd then we used that model to better localize our drones, to search in locations with higher chances of finding someone,\u201d he said.",
      "At WPI, Sanket\u2019s project addresses other limitations of current drones, including their size and perception capabilities.",
      "\u201cCurrent robots are big, bulky, expensive and cannot work in all sorts of scenarios,\u201d he said.",

A small ultrasonic sensor, not unlike those used in automatic faucets in public restrooms, mimics bat behavior, sending out a pulse of high-frequency sound and using the echo to detect obstacles in its path.",
      "During a recent demonstration, a student used a remote control to launch the drone in a brightly lit room and then again after turning off all but a faintly glowing red light. As it approached a clear, Plexiglas wall, the drone repeatedly halted and backed away, even with the lights off and with fog and fake snow swirling through the air.",
      "\u201cCurrently, search and rescue robots are mainly operational in broad daylight,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cThe problem is that search and rescues are dull, dangerous and dirty jobs that happen a lot of times in darkness.\u201d",
      "But development didn\u2019t go completely smoothly. The researchers realized that the noise of the bat robot\u2019s propellers interfered with the ultrasound, requiring 3D printed shells to minimize the interference. They also used artificial intelligence to teach the drone how to filter and interpret sound signals.",
      "Still, there\u2019s a long way to go to match bats, which can contract and compress their muscles to listen only to certain echoes and can detect something as small as a human hair from several meters away.",
      "\u201cBats are amazing,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cWe are nowhere close to what nature has achieved. But the goal is that one day in the future, we will be there and these will be useful for deployment in the wild.\u201d",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- A fragment of a mask that was preserved for hundreds of years in permafrost sat in the muck of a low tide in the western Alaska community of Quinhagak. Wooden spoons, toys, a fishing lure and other artifacts were strewn, in some cases for miles, along the beach.",
      "The Yup'ik community near the edge of the Bering Sea was spared the widespread devastation wrought by the remnants of Typhoon Halong on its neighbors further west earlier this month. But it suffered a different kind of blow: The lashing winds and storm surge devoured dozens of feet of shoreline, disrupting a culturally significant archaeological site and washing away possibly thousands of unearthed artifacts.",
      "About 1,000 pieces, including wooden masks and tools, were recovered in Quinhagak after the storm ravaged parts of southwest Alaska on Oct. 11 and 12. But many more pieces \u2014 perhaps up to 100,000 \u2014 were left scattered, said Rick Knecht, an archaeologist who has worked on the Nunalleq, or old village, project for 17 years. That's roughly the number of pieces previously recovered from the archaeological site.",
      "Meanwhile, freezing temperatures and ice have settled into the region, stalling immediate efforts to find and recover more displaced artifacts on searches done by four-wheeler and foot.",
      "Knecht called what happened a major loss. The site has yielded the world's largest collection of pre-contact Yup'ik artifacts. Much of what's known about Yup'ik life before outsiders arrived stems from the project, said Knecht, an emeritus senior lecturer in archaeology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.",
      "\u201cWhen there are holes or disturbances in the site, it\u2019s like trying to read a book with holes in the pages. You're going to miss a few things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the bigger those holes are, the weaker the story gets. There\u2019s a few holes in the book right now.\u201d",
      "While the name of the original village isn't known, it was attacked by another village and burned around 1650, he said. Knecht has worked with elders and others in Quinhagak to combine their traditional knowledge with the technology and techniques used by the archaeology teams to study the past together.",
      "Quinhagak has about 800 residents, and subsistence food gathering is critically important to them.",
      "The storm dispersed artifacts from a site long preserved by permafrost, Knecht said. A longstanding concern has been the threat that climate change \u2014 melting permafrost, coastal erosion, the potential for more frequent or stronger storms \u2014 has posed to the site, he said.",
      "It poses risks to the community itself. Erosion threatens major infrastructure in Quinhagak, including a sewage lagoon, homes and fish camps. Thawing permafrost is also unsettling and undermining buildings, according to a 2024 report from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.",

      "In fact, South Asian voter turnout in the 2025 NYC primary election increased by about 40% compared to the 2021 primary, according to data from research firm L2 provided to ABC News.",
      "\"This has created so much interest,\" Mahmood said, saying that South Asians and Muslims are \"definitely engaging more\" in New York politics. He did, however, express concerns over how long the participation will last, and said he was \"real skeptical\" that such energy will translate to other candidates in the future.",
      "The emphasis on a candidate's identity was particularly heightened in this race -- something that has been embraced by Mamdani's campaign and supporters, but attacked by his opponents.",
      "Born in Uganda, Mamdani is a Muslim of Indian descent who has lived in the United States since he was seven years old before becoming a naturalized citizen in 2018.",
      "\"This campaign has awakened something powerful in New York\u2019s South Asian and Muslim communities -- a sense of visibility, pride, and political belonging that\u2019s been denied for generations,\" Dora Pekec, a spokesperson for Mamdani, told ABC in a statement.",
      "Vishvajit Singh, a storyteller and artist who has lived in NYC for ten years, told ABC News prior to Election Day that \"the excitement to vote is real, even beyond the South Asian community.\"",
      "\"Both supporters and critics of his candidacy stand to benefit -- his rise may open more opportunities for South Asians ('desis') in U.S. governance,\" Singh said, adding that Mamdani's victory will \"inspire children of brown and even Hispanic backgrounds to think about big governmental positions.\"",
      "Raza Ahmad Rumi, a policy analyst and lecturer at City University of New York originally from Pakistan, told ABC how Mamdani\u2019s rise \"reflects a generational shift in New York politics.\"",
      "\"His charisma and connection with people -- including support from white and Jewish youth -- show that his appeal goes far beyond identity,\" Rumi said.",
      "Mamdani's impact appears to transcend beyond the Big Apple, reaching community members across the country and overseas.",
      "\"I don't know a single South Asian -- and I know a lot of South Asians -- who doesn't know about this race going on,\" Mahmood, who is based in California, said.",
      "Dr. Naomi Green, assistant-secretary general for the Muslims Council of Britain, told ABC News that Mamdani's \"broad support across New York and beyond is proof that people value justice and inclusion over prejudice.\" In 2016, London made history when the city elected its first Muslim mayor.",
      "Ushering in NYC's first Muslim mayor marks a significant milestone in a place that has experienced longstanding Islamophobia, especially following the deadly 9/11 terrorist attacks that occurred in the city.",

      "Cuomo has\u00a0pushed back\u00a0on these accusations, arguing that Mamdani was being divisive and falsely alleging Islamophobia. Speaking to Fox News just days before the election, Cuomo accused Mamdani of \"playing the race card\" and attempting to win voters on the basis of his identity.",
      "Mahmood told ABC that such commentary actually helped Mamdani by fueling voter anger against his opponents.",
      "But not all South Asians are enthusiastic about Mamdani. In October, Cuomo launched a \"South Asians for Cuomo\" coalition that rallied around the Independent candidate over Mamdani.",
      "The Indian community has seen particular divide, with some criticizing Mamdani's economic policies and even accusing him of being anti-Hindu,\u00a0pointing to his\u00a0past remarks\u00a0about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "The Mamdani campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on these anti-Hindu accusations. A campaign adviser told the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0that Mamdani rejects anti-Hindu rhetoric, and pointed out that his mother is Hindu.",
      "Fahad Solaiman, member of Jackson Heights Bangladeshi Business Development Association and Community Board, told ABC that he takes issue with feasibility of Mamdani's promises, calling them \"unrealistic.\"",

      "The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments about Trump's tariffs on Wednesday.",
      "The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on Wednesday in a case that will determine the fate of President Donald Trump\u2019s steepest tariffs, carrying implications for prices paid by shoppers and interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, economists told ABC News.",
      "The nation\u2019s highest court will weigh in on the lawfulness of far-reaching levies on dozens of countries unveiled in a Rose Garden ceremony that Trump dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" The case also concerns tariffs imposed on China, Mexico and Canada, as well as a baseline 10% levy slapped on nearly all imports.",
      "The ruling could impact tens of billions in tax revenue and alter trade agreements struck with some of the largest U.S. trade partners, including the United Kingdom and China.",
      "Some economists who spoke to ABC News said the case could alter costs borne by U.S. households and hiring decisions made by companies, though the effect may be limited since the Trump administration will likely seek to reimpose tariffs under other legal authorities.",
      "Still, the economists added, the court\u2019s ruling could have a profound impact on the U.S. economy for years to come, since a unilateral executive power to impose tariffs would establish a new lever for policies like taxation and trade at the heart of economic stewardship.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are really high for the economy because tariffs have an effect on trade not only in the U.S. but across the globe,\u201d Raymond Robertson, a professor of trade, economics and public policy at Texas A&M University, told ABC News.",
      "Trump has repeatedly defended his legal authority to impose the tariffs and warned of economic damage if they were to be struck down.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t win that case, we will be a weakened, troubled financial mess for many, many years to come,\u201d Trump said last month at a White House event. \u201cAnd if we do, we\u2019re going to be the most powerful economic country in the world.\u201d",
      "Trump ratcheted up tariffs in recent months, in part due to powers invoked under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the legal authority at issue before the Supreme Court.",
      "Tariffs stand at an overall average effective rate of 17.9%, the highest since 1934, the Yale Budget Lab found last week. Price levels are expected to climb incrementally this year as a result of the levies, representing a loss of about $1,800 for the average household, the group said.",
      "\u201cHigher tariffs are pushing up prices in some categories of goods, resulting in higher overall inflation,\u201d Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last week, though he said the most likely outcome is a merely temporary price hike.",
      "Inflation ticked up to 3% in September, reaching its highest level since January. Meanwhile, hiring has slowed in recent months, posing a risk of an economic double-whammy known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court allows Trump\u2019s steepest tariffs to stand, price increases may accelerate while economic uncertainty associated with the tariffs could put downward pressure on hiring, some economists said.",

      "\u201cIf the tariffs are here to stay, then I would expect this leads to more price increases to come by those who have, for now, held back and not changed prices yet because they\u2019re unsure about the permanence of these tariffs,\u201d Felix Tintelnot, a professor of economics at Duke University, told ABC News.",
      "Those economic conditions could make policy decisions more difficult for the Fed, since the central bank must balance a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and maximize employment, Tintelnot added, saying the Supreme Court decision may influence the level of interest rates.",
      "\u201cIf we remove these tariffs, it would reduce the inflationary pressure and that might give the Fed more room to cut interest rates than if we kept these tariffs for longer,\u201d Tintelnot said.",
      "Tariffs issued under the legal authority at question before the Supreme Court have accounted for about $90 billion in tariff revenue, raising a possibility of the funds being returned if the justices deem the tariffs unlawful, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found. The ruling could in turn hold implications for the nation's federal debt, the group said.",
      "Still, some economists said the Supreme Court case would have little effect on inflation or interest rates due to the sheer size and inertia of the U.S. economy, as well as the Trump administration\u2019s plans to impose tariffs under other legal authorities.",
      "Trump would still retain the power to impose sector-specific tariffs and the ability to impose a 15% tariff for up to 150 days under the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to address trade disparities with other countries.",
      "\u201cThere will be efforts to rebuild the current set of tariffs even if these are struck down,\u201d Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told ABC News. \u201cImporters in no way, shape or form should anticipate that even if these are struck down, that these tariffs are going away.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration touts tariffs as part of a wider set of \u201cAmerica First economic policies,\u201d which have \u201csparked trillions of dollars in new investment in U.S. manufacturing, technology, and infrastructure,\u201d according to the White House's website.",
      "A Supreme Court ruling against the president\u2019s steepest tariffs could scuttle some of the promised investment and country-by-country trade agreements, some economists said, but they cast doubt on the staying power of the commitments regardless of the court\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cThese deals are fuzzy,\u201d Matias Vernengo, a professor of economics at Bucknell University, told ABC News.",
      "Still, even economists who downplayed the short-term impact of the court\u2019s decision acknowledged significant implications for the years-long outlook of the economy.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are less the short-run effects tariffs would have and more the long-run effects. If this president or any president can make changes at the last minute, it undermines the possibility of having stable rules for trade and the organization of the world economy,\u201d Vernengo said.",

      "Republican candidates running in the 2026 midterm elections are ramping up for a campaign cycle in lockstep with President Donald Trump, their party kingmaker who's keenly invested in their races, which will determine much about how the latter half of his second term will play out.",
      "National Republicans are focused on retaining control of both chambers of Congress during the elections, ensuring that the legislative portion of Trump's presidency can carry on. With Democratic control, they could ramp up investigations and oversight hearings that could put his administration on the defensive.",
      "The president is expected to be engaged in the midterms, campaigning for Republican candidates and having a hand in messaging and candidate selection, a Republican official close to the White House told ABC News, in order to prevent messy primaries or bids from non-Trump-aligned options.",
      "\"[The White House is] very involved in making sure we have the right candidates next year, that we're backing the right folks and that we're basically prepared and ready to go,\" the official told ABC News. \"The thinking basically started even before the president took office, like it's been a fantastic change compared to 2017, 2018.\"",
      "\"People on our side remember what it was like to deal with all of these investigations ... and how much it distracted and hurt the president's agenda. So I do think, especially on our side, when we're talking to our base, we're going to remind voters, you need to get out and vote to give the president a full four years.\"",
      "To win races, Republicans are strategizing on how to mobilize Trump voters, whose turnout has historically been lower in off-presidential election cycles, the Republican official and other GOP political operatives said. Ongoing pushes from Trump and other Republicans for mid-cycle redistricting in order to gain additional House seats are another way the party is shoring up its chances for victory.",
      "A year out from the midterms, an\u00a0ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\u00a0published on Sunday finds 46% of registered voters saying they would support the Democratic candidate in House races if the election were held today. That's a significant drop from a\u00a0November 2017 ABC News/Washington Post poll, when voters had an 11-percentage-point preference for Democratic candidates.",
      "\u201cWhile Democrats face historically low approval ratings, a Sanders\u2019 socialists vs. Schumer\u2019s favorites proxy war for control of their Party, and an identity crisis after a decade of standing for nothing except hating President Trump, Republicans are united behind an agenda of promises made, promises kept to American working families who want to see Washington focused on the issues that matter to them,\" National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez said in a statement to ABC.",

      "\"The Republicans are going to do a Midterm Convention in order to show the great things we have done since the Presidential Election of 2024,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform in September.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats are cognizant of Republicans' ramped up mobilization efforts, attempting to counter them by making strides early to be more competitive in future races.",
      "\"One thing that the Republicans have done, and quite sophisticatedly, is they run a permanent campaign. They never stop organizing. They never stop communicating,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin said in an interview with ABC News. \"We're not going to wait until '28 to start campaigning for president.

      "They're also looking to leverage Democrats' apparent lack of party unity, which has contributed to several messy Senate primary fights in key battleground states like Maine, Michigan, Texas and Iowa.",
      "\"Our ducks are in a row,\" the official said, \"it's an advantage that the Democrats had in '22 that we didn't-- messy primaries this time around, that script is completely flipped.\"",
      "While Republicans have largely avoided significant MAGA proxy battles, a few have still percolated. In Kentucky, Trump has weighed in against Rep.

      "In Louisiana, incumbent Sen. Bill Cassidy is facing several primary challengers after his past criticism of Trump.",
      "A messy primary is also brewing in Texas, but is viewed as less of a MAGA-on-MAGA battle, and more of a personal fight between Trump loyalist Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, who has also been a longtime ally of the president.",

      "Newsom has discarded Democrats' \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra.",
      "At the beginning of the year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's tenure was marked by devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, a steady stream of ridicule from the White House, and backlash from within the Democratic Party for siding with conservatives on transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "Not to mention, in the summer of 2021, Newsom weathered a blistering attempt to recall him from office -- his starpower at risk.",
      "Yet the twice-elected governor has pulled off a reputational heel turn, marked by viral Trump-mocking social media posts and parody MAGA merch coupled with a statewide redistricting measure that would level Republican's attempt to get an edge ahead of next year's midterms.",
      "Now, Newsom is a leader running miles ahead of others, experts explained to ABC News.",
      "One of the most noticeable transformations was the rebrand of Newsom's official governor social media account. A senior Newsom official told ABC that the weekend of June 6, when the team learned the president was federalizing the National Guard into Los Angeles, was when the \"red line\" was crossed, and a more defiant version of the Democratic governor debuted.",
      "\"That is when everything changed, with the governor, with our social media,\" the official said.",
      "On June 10, Newsom's @GovPressOffice account shared a TikTok video, where a voiceover, in the style of a Star Wars villain, mimicked Trump's TruthSocial post announcing the federalization of troops. That post generated over 800,000 views.",
      "The salvo continued. The same day, Newsom, on Instagram, responded to Trump mocking him as \"Newscum\" on Truth Social with a diss-video set to the Taylor Swift (another common Trump target) song \"You Need To Calm Down,\" dismissing Trump as \"keyboard warrior.\" That short video has 11.3 million views.",
      "The mocking never let up.",
      "'Newsom Derangement Syndrome'",
      "A non-exhaustive list of the incoming includes: accusing Trump of having \"Newsom Derangement Syndrome,\" a play on Trump's oft-referred \"Trump Derangement Syndrome;\" likening Trump adviser Stephen Miller to Voldemort, the villain from the Harry Potter series, and calling him submissive; calling Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \"Kosplay Kristi\" and urging followers to \"hide yo dogs,\" a reference to Noem's infamous tale of shooting and killing her own dog, Cricket; mocking Vice President JD Vance over a debunked rumor that he performed sex acts with a couch; and comparing White House border czar Tom Homan to an uncooked ham.",
      "Since then, Newsom's social media accounts have skyrocketed. Follower counts across multiple platforms for his non-government account, @GavinNewsom, ballooned -- growing to more than 11 million followers collectively. Nearly half of those followers were new this year.",
      "One of the official accounts, @GovPressOffice, has seen nearly 1 billion impressions on X since those first provocative posts in June, per Newsom's campaign.",
      "Newsom even launched his own \"patriot\" merchandise shop, repurposing Trump's Make America Great Again slogan -- Make America Gavin Again -- and selling REAL PATRIOT hats NEWSOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING! And REAL PATRIOT hats, and kneepads marked with Trump's signature.",
      "A key mark in Newsom's success is upending the \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra coined by Michelle Obama in 2016, suggested Parker Butler, the former director of Kamala Harris' presidential campaign's buzzy social media channel, @KamalaHQ. \"That is not where we are right now.\"",

      "\"We need to throw the sort of old rulebook out the window,\" Butler added.",
      "When Newsom launched his new solo podcast \"This is Gavin Newsom\" in March, he said he wanted to \"debate without demeaning\" and engage with people most members his party wouldn't dare to speak to. He called the Democratic brand \"toxic.\" He's positioned himself as a lefty alternative in the GOP-de-jour manosphere space.

Elliott said that since the office has sharpened its tone, donations have poured in from millions of supporters.",
      "\"How do you get 1.2 million people from all 50 states all across the country to buy into this defense of democracy? You do it by getting attention,\" Eliott said.",

      "John Dennis, former chair of the San Francisco Republican Party, said Newsom's tactic is the latest iteration of what he and other critics call a history of \"shapeshifting.\"",
      "\"He doesn't know who he is. So he's trying to be everybody else,\" Dennis said.",
      "But he admits it appears to be working.",
      "\"This Prop 50 move is a very clever move for the Democrats.

      "Dan Schnur, a longtime California political analyst and UC-Berkeley professor, called the Proposition 50 campaign \"a self-delivered political gift for Newsom.\"",
      "Newsom's successes put him in a solid position to launch a presidential bid, an ambition Californians are under no illusions about.",
      "\"Every governor looks in the mirror and sees a president looking back at them, and Newsom probably whistles \"Hail to the Chief\" when he's in the shower every morning,\" Schnur said. \"It's hard to predict exactly how the race plays out, but the governor of the largest state in the country, who is also the most visible and impactful Trump critic, and who has access to tremendous amounts of fundraising dollars could be a pretty formidable contender.\"",

      "Democrats, in the throes of rebuilding their party can agree, at least, on one thing: they are fed up with being portrayed as losers.",
      "Several ABC News interviews with Democratic strategists, current and former national staffers, and state-level officials raise several questions from within the party of how to best shift perceptions ahead of the midterms: does the party go full bore on anti-Trump messaging as the navigate the politics of the ongoing government shutdown and voters feel the pinch? Do they focus, instead, on boosting progressive rising stars even as Republicans paint the party as too-radical?",
      "Some less conventional Democrats question whether the party should bother relying on the traditional leadership structure, who may lean too much on outdated tactics, in Washington at all. While other, more traditional members, argue they're not in as much disarray as their critics claim.",
      "Democrats in Washington point to recent wins as proof that their brand is not as toxic as some critics claim: two Republican legislative district flips in Iowa; electing a Democrat in a Pennsylvania state senate seat for the first time in 130 years; elevating a Democratic mayor to lead Omaha's blue dot, for example.",
      "They're banking on likely successes in the days-away gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey (and to a lesser extent, dominance in New York City's mayoral race) as reputational defibrillators a year out from the midterms.",
      "\"We have the momentum, certainly, heading into this final stretch,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin told ABC News in a recent interview, of anticipated wins in New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania's supreme court races.",
      "Yet a\u00a0recent\u00a0ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\u00a0found that more Americans say the Democratic Party is \"out of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today\" (68%) than Trump (63%) and the Republican Party (61%).",
      "Asked on Sunday why more Americans feel this way about Democrats than the president -- even amidst the East Wing demolitions or a White House Halloween party hosted during the shutdown -- Martin suggested Republicans were in hotter water and disapproved of by Americans more.",
      "But pressed on what Democrats are doing to try to get more in touch with voters -- or why he thinks, even if there is a swing away from Trump, people still see the Democrats as out of touch -- Martin said he's confident the party is making strides regardless of what the polls say.",
      "\"I can't speak to that because I've seen a lot of other polls that suggest just the opposite, right? People are starting to put their trust and faith back in with the Democratic Party. And you know, I can tell you right now that you know, we've been out there having conversations with voters, growing our coalition,\" Martin said, adding that Trump's policies and actions are creating an opening for Democrats to have conversations with disillusioned voters.",
      "Democrats also hope to mine several lessons from their soon-to-be-released election analysis (don't call it a postmortem, members joke).",
      "One of Martin biggest takeaways from the report, he told ABC News, is that \"everyone just started their campaign way too late, and we had already been defined before we ever had a chance to define ourselves ... we cannot wait to talk to voters until the final few months before an election.\"",
      "Yet, some Democrats see their party's lower approval numbers (32%, per a recent Associated Press survey)\u00a0and believe they should pivot away from the traditional party apparatus.",
      "\"We are a party without a leader, and so there is no one to set the tone,\" a former DNC staffer and Democratic strategist told ABC News.",
      "They argue that there are vulnerabilities beyond the DNC, but also from more classical candidate recruitment from congressional leadership's political operation, who they suggested are not taking necessary risks on non-traditional picks. Sen. Chuck Schumer is reportedly facing resistance to his leadership among potential Senate candidates.",
      "A second former DNC staffer, who has since worked on presidential campaigns, put it more bluntly: \"The current iteration of the DNC has weakened itself out of relevance and should not be seen as anything but a fundraising vessel.\"",
      "Libby Schneider, deputy executive director of the DNC, concedes that it's typical after an election loss to be heartbroken and upset, and understands there may be some criticism in its wake. Despite that, she argues the committee is laser-focused on winning and wishes to be a tool to help candidates succeed.",
      "\"People can feel what they need to feel and grieve how they need to grieve about this loss, and we will change the things that we need to change in order to continue to perform well. But to me, people complaining tells me that they care a whole lot, and I think that that's valuable. And also, frankly, we can listen to that stuff and still do our jobs every day to elect Democrats,\" said Schneider.",
      "\"We went from being the party of cool with Barack Obama to turning into the party of nerds and dweebs and losers, right? What is really annoying about all of it is that we have winners. We have good stars,\" the second staffer continued. told ABC News.",
      "Obama has aligned himself, and whatever residual it-factor he possesses, with marquee political fights over the last few months: rallying Texas Democrats who broke quorum, in-person campaigning for both the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races, boosting Democrats in Pennsylvania's supreme court elections, to cutting ads for Gov. Gavin Newsom's redistricting proposition.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris is also keeping her options open on her political career, as she publicly doesn't rule out another White House run during her book tour.",

At the same time, if we're serious about telling voters we're moving forward -- she can't be our nominee in 2028. Is she a leading voice in the party, yes? Should she be our main and only voice, absolutely not,\" the first former DNC staffer added.",
      "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has also been criss-crossing the country with rumored '28 candidate Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drawing substantial crowds, meanwhile, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Newsom have not shied away from their ambitions, either.",
      "Some Democrats argue that not having one main spokesperson presents an opportunity for the various stars, rising or seasoned, to sparkle.",
      "\"We have to be a tent that wins by addition and not subtraction,\" Schneider said. She feels confident ahead of Tuesday's elections, and believes that there's a strong case to be made to voters about Trump's impact on their bottom line, their health care premiums, their overall cost of living, as well as voters' souring on the president's handling of the economy and immigration.",
      "Per a new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, roughly 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the job.",
      "And despite worries of disinterested donors and shrinking voter registration, the campaign arms of the party, taking cues from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are outraising their Republican counterparts, even as the national party heavily lags in that arena. The DSCC raised nearly $20 million in Q3, versus the NRSC's $18 million, and the DCCC currently has a slight cash-on-hand edge, with $46.6 million to the NRCC's $45.8. A DNC official says the committee",
      "Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who rebuilt the DNC as chair after the party's devastating losses in 2001, is bullish on his party's chances to sweep over the next year, as he believes droves of voters will reject Trump due to rising costs, shrinking access to health care, and negative impacts of the government shutdown, and trickle back to Democrats after this off-cycle election day.",
      "\"T\u200b\u200bhe Democratic Party is poised to take off like a booster rocket,\" said McAuliffe, who, a few weeks ago, hosted a packed fundraiser for Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Abigail Spanberger, at his home alongside the Clintons on behalf of the Democratic Governors' Association.",
      "McAuliffe said the 400-or-so attendees raised $2.2 million in one night -- proof, he argues, of his party's unquestionable desire to win. His message to hand-wringers and eye-rollers, even some within the party, echoes from what many at the top tell ABC: \"We need to be encouraged, people are counting on us to fight. I'm tired of the whining, complaining, the party of lemon suckers. Get in the game.\"",
      "Jaime Harrison, Martin's most recent predecessor at the DNC, realized the extent of his party's vulnerabilities during his 2020 Senate bid to unseat Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. (Santa Claus could run on Christmas as a Democrat and lose, he jokes.)",
      "Harrison worries about the perceptions of disjointedness, and suggested that various groups like the DGA, members of Congress, and the DNC convene for a joint-policy retreat \"so that people see we're all in alignment on our message, on our mission.\"",
      "Harrison also said he hopes the party seriously considers hosting a midterm convention, which could amplify their talent and hammer home their priorities. Schneider said a potential event is \"in the mix.\"",
      "\"The Democrats are looking for a unity of purpose, a unity of message, a unity of strategy. And it's important that the leadership right now provides that,\" said Harrison, who says he trusts Martin and believes support, from donors and otherwise, will return after Democratic wins on Tuesday.",
      "\"I'm not overly concerned. If we were in June of '26 and we're still not getting major donors, then I'm concerned. But we're not there yet,\" he added, expressing confidence in the continued grassroots support.",
      "Some Democrats also point to Martin's tenure as one that prioritizes infrastructure. For example, state parties now get major influxes of cash, to the tune of a million dollars a month, to hire staff, set up programs, and fortify their ranks. \"Party changing money,\" adds Schneider. Lauren Necochea, chair of the Idaho Democrats, told ABC News her chapter now has steady, monthly financial support.",
      "Texas Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the Lone Star State House Democratic caucus, said Jefferies and Martin gave his cohort full support to break quorum and attempt to block Republican redistricting efforts, a move that kicked off the party's more aggressive opposition to redistricting nationwide.",
      "Wu acknowledges that the perception of the Democratic Party is in peril, and is anxious for politicians to openly fight for the working class. He says voters, friends see Democrats as message-less, scolding hall monitors.",
      "\"People who would rather be right than win; people who would rather spend the time to tell other people how they're wrong instead of telling people what they would do about it and how they're going to fix it,\" Wu told ABC News.",
      "Wu said candidates need to be firmer on their beliefs, and his party must run candidates willing to take Republicans to task (like California's Gov. Newsom in his push to draw Democratic friendly maps) or face total failure.",
      "\"I think that the reality of where we are today and what the cost of failure will mean, I don't think people are under any illusion of where we are at this moment,\" said Wu, who added, \"this is not time for us to screw around ... I don't give a crap that you think Democrats are wimpy or whatever else. But if you want America to not suck anymore, you better join us.\"",

      "Jones also submitted dozens of other fraudulent expense reimbursement requests, including fake and altered invoices, and charged millions of dollars in personal expenses to corporate credit cards, embezzling more than $3.8 million from the Hawks, prosecutors allege. The expenses included travel to the Bahamas, Costa Rica, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Switzerland and Thailand, as well as Louis Vuitton apparel and Porsche car expenses, the filing says.",

      "U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw will hear evidence on motions from the defense asking him to dismiss the charges and throw out some of the evidence.",
      "Here's what to know about the latest developments in the case:",
      "Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.",
      "While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported and held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.",
      "Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump's Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked Crenshaw to dismiss them.",
      "Abrego Garcia is charged with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling, with prosecutors claiming he accepted money to transport within the United States people who were in the country illegally.",
      "The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security agent testified at an earlier hearing that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring back Abrego Garcia.",
      "Abrego Garcia has asked Crenshaw to dismiss the smuggling charges on the grounds of \u201cselective or vindictive prosecution.\u201d",

      "Another motion from Abrego Garcia asks the judge to suppress evidence in the case. It claims the 2022 traffic stop that ultimately led to the smuggling charges was illegal, so evidence from that stop should not be used at trial.",
      "In support, court filings say the state trooper who pulled him over stated that the speed limit was 65 mph (105 kph) when it was actually 70 mph (113 kph). The trooper accused him of driving at 75 mph (120 kph), but there is no record that the trooper used a radar gun or pacing to gauge the speed. Abrego Garcia said he was driving at 70 mph, correctly noting the speed limit.",
      "Attorneys for the government argue that the trooper made an honest mistake. The speed limit decreases to 65 mph about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) farther down the interstate. The attorneys also note that Abrego Garcia was driving in the left lane \u201cconsistent with an individual traveling in excess of the posted speed limit.\u201d And the trooper, they said, had \"no reason or motivation to manufacture a traffic violation against him.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia currently can't be deported to El Salvador thanks to the 2019 settlement that found he had a \u201cwell founded fear\u201d of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past couple of months government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.",
      "The administration\u2019s deportation agreements with so-called third countries have been contested in court by advocacy groups, which have noted that some immigrants are being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. But in June, a divided Supreme Court allowed the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands and with minimal notice.",
      "Abrego Garcia sued the Trump administration in a Maryland court over his earlier deportation, and the judge in that case has temporarily barred his removal. If the judge decides to lift that order, government attorneys have said they are ready to deport him right away.",
      "Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the U.S. in immigration court.",

      "The Ultimate Fighting Championship\u00a0mixed martial arts company has cut fighter Issac Dulgarian, days after his loss by first round submission to Yadier del Valle during Saturday's Fight Night prompted a probe of possible pre-bout irregular betting patterns.",
      "This makes the UFC the latest sports entity navigating a possible gambling-related integrity issue, joining Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, which recently saw FBI arrests connected to a gambling investigation.",
      "Suspicious gambling activity was reportedly flagged after the odds on Dulgarian, the favorite, changed rapidly in the hours leading up to the bout, leading several major sports betting sites to stop taking wagers on the contest due to the betting patterns.",
      "The UFC said in a statement Monday: \"Like many professional sports organizations, UFC works with an independent betting integrity service to monitor wagering activity on our events. Our betting integrity partner, IC360, monitors wagering on every UFC event and is conducting a thorough review of the facts surrounding the Dulgarian vs. del Valle bout on Saturday, November 1. We take these allegations very seriously, and along with the health and safety of our fighters, nothing is more important than the integrity of our sport.\"",
      "The controversy may have played out in the Octagon. Cageside commentators Daniel Cormier and Michael Chiesa called the submission \"white belt stuff\" on air, implying that sloppy actions led to the loss.",
      "The integrity of specific UFC bouts has faced scrutiny before, most notably for contests involving former UFC veteran and coach James Krause. He was investigated for allegedly using his background in mixed martial arts to offer insights to offshore sportsbooks and bettors. Krause was also suspended by the UFC for failing to disclose a fighter's pre-fight injury. He was never charged with any crimes.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The suit worn by Will Ferrell in the 2003 comedy hit \"Elf\" is going under the hammer at an auction of movie memorabilia in London this December, and the skin-tight green and yellow piece of Hollywood Christmas magic is expected to fetch over a quarter of a million dollars.",
      "Bidding for the iconic suit, complete with the conical hat and matching tunic, will begin at 50,000 pounds, the equivalent of about $65,000, but it's expected to eventually sell for as much as 200,000 pounds, or about $261,000, when the hammer falls at the Propstore Winter Entertainment Memorabilia auction.",
      "According to the description on the Propstore Auction house's website, there are tags reading \"Mr. Ferrell\" on the inside of the tunic and the stockings, with \"Hero-3\" also handwritten on the tunic tag.",
      "The auctioneers say the belt also has \"Mr. Ferrell\" written on it in blue ink.",
      "Large movie productions often create several versions of the same props, but the term \"hero\" is typically used to describe the highly detailed iterations which are central to the plot and intended for close-up shots in the final cut of the movie.",
      "The suit going up for sale does not appear to be the same one that Ferrell wore to an NHL hockey game in Los Angeles just after Christmas last year, when he gave fellow sports fans a giggle by sitting near the ice looking disgruntled with a beer and a cigarette in the garish outfit.",
      "Another notable item up for sale in the December auction is Marty McFly's iconic hoverboard from the second and third installations of the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, which is expected to sell for more than $156,000.",
      "According to the product description, it's the lightweight foam version of the prop, which actors used for scenes where their characters were seen carrying the boards, rather than a wooden version that Michael J. Fox and his fellow actors were seen riding in other parts of the movies.",
      "The example of the then-futuristic hoverboard does have some \"wear from use and age, including adhesive residue around the fastening strips, cracks in the foam, and paint chipping throughout,\" according to the auctioneers.",
      "The most valuable lot in the auction, however, will be the original prop used as Boba Fett's rifle in \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.\"",
      "The auction house says it is the only known example of the prop. Other stunt versions and castings were made for later movies in the franchise, but, according to Propstore Auctions, this EE-3 carbine blaster has been \"identified by its serial number and photo-matched by details on the stock, directly confirming its provenance.\"",
      "The blaster, which started its life as a genuine 1917 Webley & Scott No.1 Mark I flare pistol, is expected to fetch the equivalent of around $915,000 when it goes under the hammer.",
      "The three day auction begins on Dec. 5 and will feature other iconic film memorabilia including Indiana Jones' fedora, worn by Harrison Ford in the 1984 \"Temple of Doom\" movie, Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightweight lightsaber from 1999's \"Phantom Menace,\" and Jack Nicholson's stunt axe from the horror classic \"The Shining.\"",

      "Her daughter, Laura Dern, said in a statement that she was by Ladd's side when she passed at her home in Ojai, California.",
      "\"She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,\" Dern said. \"We were blessed to have her. She is flying with her angels now.\"",
      "Dern's statement didn't immediately cite a cause of death.",
      "In 2023, the mother and daughter told \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0that the two began taking daily walks in Santa Monica after learning that Ladd had developed a lung disease, believed to be caused by exposure to pesticides. Dern was told her mother only had six months to live.",
      "That's when the two had conversations that eventually filled the pages of \"Honey, Baby, Mine,\" their joint memoir named for an old folk song Ladd's father used to sing. They discussed everything, starting with Ladd's marriage and divorce from Laura's father, actor Bruce Dern, to her efforts to discourage Laura from joining the family business.",
      "\"She was only, like, 11 years old, and I said, 'Don't be an actress. Be a doctor, be a lawyer,'\" Ladd said. \"Nobody cares if you put on weight or your chin points when you cry if you're a doctor. They just want you to be the best you can be. But an actress? They care, care, care, care, care.\"",
      "But Dern said there was no stopping her from being in movies: \"No. It is all I knew.\"",
      "A native of Laurel, Mississippi, Ladd was apparently destined to stand out. In her 2006 memoir, \"Spiraling Through the School of Life,\" she remembered being told by her great-grandmother that she would one day be in \"front of a screen\" and would \"command\" her own audiences.",
      "By the mid-1970s, she had lived out her fate well enough to tell The New York Times that she no longer denied herself the right to call herself great.",
      "\"Now I don't say that,\" she said. \"I can do Shakespeare, Ibsen, English accents, Irish accents, no accent, stand on my head, tap dance, sing, look 17 or look 70.\"",
      "A gifted comic and dramatic performer, Ladd had a long career in television and on stage before breaking through as a film performer in Martin Scorsese's 1974 release \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.\" She earned an Oscar nomination for supporting actor for her turn as the acerbic, straight-talking Flo, and went on to appear in dozens of movies over the following decades.",
      "Her many credits included \"Chinatown,\" \"Primary Colors\" and two other movies for which she received best supporting nods, \"Wild at Heart\" and \"Rambling Rose,\" both of which co-starred her daughter. She also continued to work in television, with appearances in \"ER,\" \"Touched by an Angel\" and \"Alice,\" the spinoff from \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" among others.",
      "Through marriage and blood relations, Ladd was tied to the arts. Tennessee Williams was a second cousin, and first husband Bruce Dern, Laura's father, was himself an Academy Award nominee. Ladd and Laura Dern achieved the rare feat of mother-and-daughter nominees for their work in \"Rambling Rose.\"",

      "In a separate interview on the same subject with CBS News' partner network BBC News, the defense chief said \"it's a move the king has indicated we should take.\"",
      "Mountbatten Windsor is the late Queen Elizabeth II's third child. He spent decades in public life as a working member of the royal family, but revelations of his historical ties to Epstein have turned him into a pariah figure. In 2016, he was named in a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Epstein paid her to have sex with the former prince on several occasions. Mountbatten Windsor has repeatedly denied the claims, but he settled the case out of court with Giuffre in 2022, for an undisclosed sum.",
      "That settlement failed to stanch criticism of the former prince and the resulting pressure on the royal family, however, as new information continued to emerge about his historic connections with Epstein in the wake of a damning 2019 interview\u00a0with the BBC's Newsnight, in which he defended his ties to the disgraced financier.",
      "In the years after that interview, right up until this year, amid revelations about correspondence between Epstein and the then-prince, the royal family appeared reluctant to intervene, allowing him to step away from public duties and to give up many of his titles and privileges of his own volition.",
      "Last week, however, in a landmark move, King Charles announced that his younger brother would be deprived of the title of prince and told to leave his 30-room, tax-payer-funded Royal Lodge home in Windsor.",
      "One of the few titles Andrew Mountbatten Windsor still holds is honorary Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy, which he received on his 55th birthday in 2015. It is unclear how long the process to remove that title, which defense chief Healy has now confirmed is underway, might take.",
      "The former prince had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, including serving as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, and commanding the anti-mine vessel HMS Cottesmore.",
      "Asked about the ongoing scandal, President Trump told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in an interview that aired Sunday on 60 Minutes that \"it's a terrible thing that's happened\" to the royal family.",
      "\"That's been a tragic situation,\" he said. \"And, I mean, I feel badly for the family.\"",
      "CBS News has contacted the royal family for comment on the pending removal of the former prince's Royal Naval title.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 11:42:02 -0500",
    "summary": "In his latest film, George Clooney plays a familiar role \u2013 one of the world's biggest movie stars \u2013 who nonetheless tries to reconcile professional success and his personal shortcomings.",
    "story": [
      "Venice can feel like a movie set, particularly when riding on a boat down the Grand Canal with George Clooney.",
      "Waving to fans, he's asked if that ever gets normal. \"No,\" he replied.",
      "Clooney has practice navigating this kind of attention. He's made about 50 films, picking up a couple of Academy Awards along the way (as an actor for \"Syriana,\" and as a producer for \"Argo\"). And for his latest, \"Jay Kelly,\" he plays one of the world's biggest movie stars \u2013 a familiar role.",
      "He says it's true that he said yes to the film within 24 hours. \"Well, I read it, and I was like, Well, if I take time to think of it, they might go get Brad. And I can't have that. I can't have that, man! When you read something, you know.\"",
      "Co-starring Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, the Netflix film \u2013 part comedy, part drama \u2013 critiques the cult of celebrity, as Clooney's character embarks on a journey to reconcile his professional success and personal failings.",
      "I asked, \"There's this kind of mind-bending experience where you're watching the film and you're wondering how much is the character and how much is George Clooney. Did you feel that making it?\"",
      "\"I really didn't,\" Clooney said. \"You know, what I know in life is you can live with failure. I tried this, it didn't work out. What you can't live with is regret. Jay Kelly is filled with regret. I mean, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, I have no regrets. I've certainly made mistakes. I've certainly done some dumb things. But I took a big bite at the apple, and I really took big swings.\"",
      "\"Were there things that felt autobiographical?\"",
      "\"I mean, there's things that we would laugh about, you know, playing a guy who no one says 'no' to.\"",
      "\"And that's the case for you?\"",
      "\"Well, I designed it so that that's not the case.\"",
      "How? \"I pay people!\" he laughed. \"No, I designed it by surrounding myself with the same friends that I met when I was 20 years old \u2026 I talk to them every day.\"",
      "\"Do you go out of your way to understand that there is this perceived gap between you and others?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Clooney said. \"I didn't grow up around fame. I mean, my father was a newscaster in Cincinnati, Ohio. My aunt [Rosemary Clooney] was a famous singer, but I'd met her three times. So, when I met someone famous, I was always like, Oh my God! And so, I always try to remind people that, honest to God, this is the job that I do and that, you know, we're all fairly normal.\"",
      "\"Why is that so important to you?\" I asked.",
      "\"I think because I was raised not only that you treat everyone equally, but that everyone treats you equally as well.\"",
      "Clooney is pretty disarming, as we saw while setting up the interview. Asked if he wanted to check how he looked in the camera, he smiled: \"No, I don't care. I'm too old to give a s*** anymore.\"",
      "\"You are, for many, kind of the poster man of aging gracefully.\"",
      "\"That's why I'm wearing these glasses,\" Clooney said, \"because for the record, I have a horrible sinus infection. If I take these off ...\" He demonstrated for us. \"You see the problem?\"",
      "\"How much does aging factor in \u2026 Do you see parts changing?\"",
      "\"I see parts on my body changing,\" he replied. \"I'm like, that fell off? How'd that fall off?\"",
      "\"I didn't mean that.\"",
      "\"Oh sure, parts have changed significantly.\"",
      "He's 64 now, married to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin. The two juggle Hollywood glamour with social justice work through their foundation. They have eight-year-old twins, and the actor (once famously single) says family life suits him \u2013 another thing that sets him apart from this character. \"Fame, [Jay] actually does really well. And I'm kind of the opposite of that in a way.\"",
      "What do you mean? \"I feel I'm a better parent, I hope, certainly husband. And fame, if there was one of the two, that would be the one I'm least comfortable with.\"",
      "\"Wow, you seem to be quite comfortable with fame and celebrity,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, you know, you got to put on your famous outfit when you come here to do a film premiere.\"",
      "\"But you know everywhere you go, people watch you. Is it performative?\"",
      "\"Sometimes it's performative,\" Clooney replied. \"I mean, listen, you don't get caught picking your nose, you know? You have to be more aware than other people would be.\"",
      "I asked, \"You seem to have this desire to keep some things for yourself, but then you can also be very political and really stick yourself out there.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, yeah,\" Clooney said. \"I try to do it when I think I have a responsibility to it. My father always told me to challenge people with more power than you, and protect people with less power. One of the things you understand is, you can't take on every fight. You have to pick things. I worked on trying to help solve some of the problems in Darfur in the early 2000s. Failed. You fail more often than you succeed. But it doesn't mean you don't keep trying. We still work there, we're still involved.\"",
      "He also does not regret writing that opinion piece in The New York Times, urging President Biden to drop out. \"To not do it would be to say I'm not going to tell the truth,\" he said.",
      "While Clooney does not shy from public activism, he gets some help guarding his private life at the family's place in Italy: \"Italian towns adopt you, Like, people come up and say, 'Which house is George Clooney's?' They go, 'Hey, he doesn't live here, he doesn't.' They protect you.\"",
      "Right now, Clooney considers France home. \"We live on a 750-acre farm, and our kids run around. We wanted them to have something of a normal existence.\"",
      "\"And you find that on a 750-acre ranch?\"",
      "\"Well, you find it on a farm, and you find on a very small school and very sort of farming community. We found a real peace there.\"",
      "He prizes that peace. In the film, Jay Kelly is searching for what George Clooney already has: a sense of self and balance. Clooney really does seem to have it all.",
      "I said, \"If people say, What was it like being with George Clooney? One of the things I'm going to say is, well, I was sitting here sweating, and somehow he didn't seem to sweat.\"",
      "\"I don't sweat!\" Clooney laughed. \"It's a funny thing. I don't sweat much when I'm on camera, funnily enough. I don't know why. I put ice cubes under my arms!\"",
      "But like the rest of us, he still has to contend with the passing of time. \"I want to work, but I don't want to fill my life with work,\" he said. \"When I turned 60, Amal and I talked about it, and I said, 'Look, I can still play basketball with the boys, I can still hang out. But in 25 years I'll be 85. And that's a real number.'",
      "\"And things change, and it doesn't matter how many granola bars you eat; it catches you. So, we have to focus on making sure we work. We also have to have focus on spending time with the people we love. More time, because at the end of your life, you don't go, I wish I'd worked more.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:37:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The author talks about his first fiction published since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him; his own immigrant experience in the U.S.; and what happens when freedom of speech dies.",
    "story": [
      "Salman Rushdie recently turned up at a McNally Johnson bookstore near South Street Seaport in Manhattan. \"It's actually not particularly close to where I live, but I come here a lot,\" he said.",
      "He was browsing for his own books. His newest one, \"The Eleventh Hour,\" is his 23rd \u2013 a collection of short stories and novellas.",
      "Life has changed since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him. \"I think what has changed is, for public-facing things, then there has to be security in a way that there wasn't for 20 years,\" he said.",
      "On August 12, 2022, Rushdie was on stage in Chautauqua, N.Y., ready to speak, ironically about America as a safe haven for writers. A man lunged at him with a knife.",
      "His account of the attack, \"Knife,\" was published in 2024: \"I raise my left hand in self-defense. He plunges the knife into it. ... After that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere. I feel my legs give way, and I fall.\"",
      "Rushdie lost the sight in his right eye. \"I can still read,\" he said, \"but I do find that I use iPads in a way that I never used to. Because there's light, and because I can adjust the size of the type. So, I never, ever, read a book on an iPad, but now I do.\"",
      "His left hand and liver were badly damaged, but he lived, which he considers \"a miracle.\"",
      "In May of this year, Rushdie's attacker, Lebanese-American Hadi Matar, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Prosecutors argued he was acting on the fatwa, the 1989 order by Iran's leader, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, to kill the author, claiming passages in his fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" insulted Islam.",
      "Recognized just for his fiction before, suddenly Rushdie was world famous (to some, infamous) for the fatwa. After nearly a decade in hiding, protected 24/7 by British security, Rushdie emerged and moved to New York, thinking times had changed. But he was wrong.",
      "Yet the author does not seem bitter or angry. \"I think that's who I am,\" he said.",
      "I suggested, \"Most people would say, well, this is a clear recipe for a life with PTSD.\"",
      "\"Well, I do have a therapist,\" Rushdie said, \"and I asked him at one point to list for me the symptoms of PTSD. And I said, 'But I don't seem to be having those symptoms, so what's wrong with me?' And he said, 'Well, it's because you're a bad-ass, that's the technical term.'\"",
      "The new book is the first fiction he's published since the attack.",
      "So, why \"The Eleventh Hour\"? \"Well, for a start, I'm 78,\" he said. \"For another thing, I had a fairly intimate encounter with death, you know, and got away with it. But it makes you think, you know? So, I thought this idea of running out of time was something I had on the brain.\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America\"",
      "\"Now you have entered the magic space of my childhood,\" the fictional narrator of one story says, as he takes a last walk up the hill to the neighborhood where the real Salman Rushdie grew up, in Mumbai, India (which he still calls Bombay). \"My relationship with the place is kind of elegiac now,\" Rushdie said. It's a relationship about something that has passed.",
      "He left India for an English boarding school at the age of 13. He left Britain after nearly 40 years there. He became an American citizen in 2016. Rushdie sees his place in the world through the eye of an immigrant.",
      "Asked what he felt after becoming a U.S. citizen, Rushdie said, \"I remember getting into a cab, leaving the office where I'd been sworn in, and being driven back through the streets of the city, and it felt different. I thought, Oh, I can belong. And it felt very good.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did the feeling that you had when you were sworn in as a citizen become fractured or altered based on what's happened since, both in public life in the United States, and to you?\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America, but it's a hard time all over,\" he replied. \"If you think of countries as people, there is their better self and their less-good self. And it would be nice if this country were to remember its better self.\"",
      "\"The Eleventh Hour\" includes a ghost story, characters who get even, a writer who disappears. But the book is also political. He writes: \"Words such as good and bad or right and wrong are losing their effect, emptying of meaning, and failing anymore to shape society.\"",
      "The meaning of words matters to Rushdie, who has spent his entire career advocating for free speech, even though exercising it nearly got him killed.",
      "He said, \"The final story in the collection, 'The Old Man in the Piazza,' is kind of an allegory of that. In fact, free speech, to my great surprise, language itself, turned into a character, a female character. She just walked into the story and sat down in a corner, and I hadn't expected her at all.\"",
      "\"She is in fact a very old language, one of the oldest and richest\u2026\" he writes, in a story about what happens when speech is restricted. \"It's even possible, though it's hard for her to admit this, even to herself, that she may die. Nobody's listening. Nobody cares.\"",
      "Language abandons her corner, leaving people no longer able to speak:\u00a0\"We are at a loss to know how things will proceed. Our words fail us.\"",
      "\"That's pretty startling and scary,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Rushdie agreed. \"It's supposed to be.\"",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "From \"In the South\"",
      "The day Junior fell down began like any other day: the explosion of heat rippling the air, the trumpeting sun\u00adlight, the traffic's tidal surges, the prayer chants in the distance, the cheap film music rising up from the floor below, the pelvic thrusts of an \"item number\" dancing across a neigh\u00adbor's TV; a child's cry, a mother's rebuke, unexplained laughter, scarlet expectorations, bicycles, the newly plaited hair of school\u00adgirls, the smell of strong coffee, a green wing flashing in a tree. Senior and Junior, two very old men, opened their eyes in their bedrooms on the fourth floor of a sea-green building on a leafy lane, just out of sight of Elliot's Beach, where, that evening, the young would congregate, as they always did, to perform the rites of youth, not far from the village of the fisherfolk, who had no time for such frivolity. The poor were puritans by night and day. As for the old, they had rites of their own and did not need to wait for evening. With the sun stabbing at them through their window blinds, the two old men struggled to their feet and lurched out onto their adjacent verandas, emerging at the same moment, like characters in an ancient tale, trapped in fateful coincidences, unable to escape the consequences of chance.",
      "Almost at once they began to speak. Their words were not new. These were ritual speeches, obeisances to the new day, of\u00adfered in call-and-response format, like the rhythmic dialogues or \"duels\" of the virtuosi of Carnatic music during the annual December festival.",
      "\"Be thankful we are men of the south,\" said Junior, stretch\u00ading and yawning. \"Southerners are we, in the south of our city in the south of our country in the south of our continent. God be praised. We are warm, slow, and sensual guys, not like the cold fishes of the north.\"",
      "Senior, scratching first his belly and then the back of his neck, contradicted him at once. \"In the first place,\" he said, \"the south is a fiction, existing only because men have agreed to call it that. Suppose men had imagined the earth the other way up! We would be the northerners then. The universe does not under\u00adstand up and down; neither does a dog. To a dog there is no north and south. And in the second place, you're not that warm a character, and a woman would laugh to hear you call yourself sensual\u2014but you are slow, that is beyond a doubt.\"",
      "This was how they were: they fought, going at each other like ancient wrestlers whose left feet were tied together at the ankles. The rope that bound them so tightly was their name. By a curious chance\u2014which they had come to think of as \"des\u00adtiny,\" or, as they more often called it, a \"curse\"\u2014they shared a name, a long name like so many names of the south, a name neither of them cared to speak. By banishing the name, by re\u00adducing it to its initial letter, V., they made the rope invisible, which did not mean it did not exist. They echoed each other in other ways\u2014their voices were high, they were of similarly wiry build and medium height, they were both nearsighted, and, after lifetimes of priding themselves on the quality of their teeth, they had both surrendered to the humiliating inevitabil\u00adity of dentures\u2014but it was the unused name, that symmetrical V., the Name That Could Not Be Spoken, that had joined them together for decades.",
      "The two old men did not share a birthday, however. One was seventeen days older than the other. That must have been how \"Senior\" and \"Junior\" got started, even though the nicknames had been in use for so long that nobody could now remember who originally thought them up. V. Senior and Junior they had become, Junior V. and Senior V. forevermore, quarreling to the death. They were eighty-one years old. If old age was thought of as an evening, ending in midnight oblivion, they were well into the eleventh hour.",

      "K\u014cRERO: THE PAST IS THE FUTURE",
      "I'd opened my share of graves before finding something of value: a pendant in the shape of a fishhook, carved from greenstone. Greenstone only came from Aotearoa, the land our people had fled before we ended up on this island. The pendant, when held to the sun, glowed soft and green as dawn through miro trees. I was of the third generation born on this island, but the pendant was from our ancestors, from before. My father said a fishhook necklace had a special meaning: it ensured seafarers safe passage over water. To wear the pendant, I braided a cord from the inner bark of a hibiscus branch, which produced a fiber so strong, even parrots couldn't bite through it.",
      "Unpleasant as it was, and offensive to our ancestors, I was ready to open more graves.",
      "Still, I had other duties to perform. I was up each morning before dawn to hunt birds. Pigeons in planting season, t\u016b\u012b birds when the flax blossomed. This time of year, it was parrots. They arrived on our island in closely bonded flocks, and it was these social connections we'd exploit to ensnare them. When our ancestors landed on this island, it was so full of birds, they named it Manumotu, or Bird Island. If only that were still the case. These days, we'd quietly crouch all morning, ready to trigger our snares, in the hopes of catching a bird or two. The worst part was the silence. I'm the talkative type. My mother says I was born speaking, which is why she named me K\u014drero. Only after hours of silent birding was I free to open graves with my best friend Hine. The two of us could talk all day.",
      "Hine's duties, unlike mine, were endless. She'd been but a girl when her mother died and she was given to an older, childless woman named Tiri. But after a few years, when Tiri went blind, it was Hine who became the caretaker. Tiri was one of the most amazing persons in the world \u2014 I admit I only knew eighty-four people \u2014 but Hine, like me, was sixteen years old, and nobody likes it when they have to do something. And Hine had to do everything for Tiri.",
      "After birding on the morning this story begins, I arrived at our island's cove to continue digging. Many people trapped on this island before us were buried around the cove. This was considered a good resting place because of the view and the breeze and because this was where birds landed after open-water voyages. Where'd the birds come from? I always wondered. Where'd they fly off to?",
      "I tethered my parrots to a branch. One was named Aroha \u2014 it was she who lured the wild parrots into our traps. I'd tug on Aroha's tether, she'd squawk in distress, and wild parrots would come to her aid.",
      "\"I ohiti r\u0101,\" I said to Aroha. \"I ohiti p\u014d.\"",
      "This was a fisherman's adage, shortened to fit a bird's memory. Alert by day, the saying went. Alert by night. My father was a fisherman.",
      "I knew from old stories that parrots could be made to talk, though I'd had no luck at it.",
      "The other parrot was freshly caught. We'd named her Kanokano \u2014 the complications she caused are soon to be described.",
      "With only a digging stick and a basket, I picked a likely spot on the upper beach and began moving sand. If only our ancestors had thought to mark their graves. But I suppose they didn't imagine being exhumed by their great-granddaughters. I ran into a lot of mangrove roots, which I hacked with the jagged edge of a mussel shell. By the time Hine and Tiri arrived, I was sweating.",
      "\"What's the ocean like today?\" Tiri asked. Her pearled-over gaze was directed at nothing.",
      "Hine rolled her eyes and helped the old woman onto a mat before handing her her weaving.",
      "\"It's blue, it's wet,\" Hine said impatiently. \"The waves go up and down.\" I described for Tiri how late-morning light penetrated the cove, illuminating the humps of mullet, how the distant reef-break frothed like coconut pulp, how sputtering waves reached up the beach before fingering all the little shells in retreat.",
      "Hine half-heartedly stabbed at some sand with her stick.",
      "I asked, \"Did you hear the Toki brothers found an earring in a grave?\" I was arm-deep in the hole, fighting roots.",
      "\"The Toki brothers are insufferable,\" Hine said. She made a gesture to help me, but looking in the hole saw I was already to the point where smelly water was seeping in.",
      "\"The earring was greenstone,\" I said. \"From the old world. I bet one of the brothers brings it to you. Will it be the big, handsome, doltish one? Or the big, handsome, inane one?\"",
      "\"Don't make fun of me,\" Hine said. \"You'll have to marry the one I reject. And have his baby.\"",
      "The Toki brothers were slow-witted, trusting, and humorless. But their father was charismatic and funny, and the truth was, Hine had a parent-crush on him. It was quite possible that when the marriage ban was lifted, she'd marry a Toki brother just to become the daughter of Papa Toki.",
      "Tiri took a breath. She always did that before beginning a story. While Hine had no patience for the old tales, I could hear them all day. Today was the story of Paikea, who was one of the navigators who discovered Aotearoa. He was from a place called Hawaiki. Tiri didn't start in the obvious places, like Paikea's departure from Hawaiki or his arrival at Aotearoa. She didn't start with Paikea sinking a canoe and drowning his seventy enemies. Nor with him being saved by a whale. Instead, she started that epic tale with a little moment: Paikea, succumbing both to vanity and shame, as he groomed his hair with a forbidden comb.",
      "All the while, Tiri did her weaving \u2014 her fingers displaying their own kind of sight.",
      "My hole reached the point where sand fell in as fast as I scooped it out. Hine scrunched her nose. It's probably clear that Hine's heart really wasn't into digging up graves. She could barely bring herself to touch any bones, and when she did, she was afraid they might belong to her mother, even though we knew her mother was buried up the hill, above the k\u016bmara fields. We'd both been there when she was put in the ground. Still, one person's bones can look like another's, which can look like anybody's, which might as well be your mother's. I hoped Hine would change her outlook when she finally found something of value in a grave.",
      "That's when my digging stick made the unmistakable knock of wood striking bone.",
      "Tiri paused her story. I reached into the dark water and felt something in the muck. Hine winced, afraid of what I'd pull out. \"I'm sorry, ancestor,\" I said. Then, with a sucking sound, I tugged out a dog skull. I reached back for its jaw, but the mud offered only bird bones and broken shells.",
      "\"Another junk pit,\" Hine said, and started pushing sand back into the hole.",
      "I contemplated the skull. Since we'd begun digging up the dead, I'd come across many dog remains. Did they happen to die at the same time as our ancestors? Were they slain and buried alongside? Or was it something else altogether? No living person on the island had ever seen a dog, and before we started digging, it was thought that dogs had never even been here.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked.",
      "\"Another dog skull,\" Hine said. \"Look at those teeth. Who'd want to get close to one of those things, let alone share the afterlife with it?\"",
      "\"Dogs had white fur, soft as t\u016b\u012b feathers,\" Tiri said. \"The old stories say they'd lick your face.\"",
      "\"They supposedly had long tongues,\" I said, marveling at the skull. Hine shook her head. \"You don't believe every story you hear, do you?\" Hine knew that I did, indeed, believe every story I heard.",
      "\"There's only one thing we know for sure about dogs,\" Hine said. \"They must've tasted good.\"",
      "What interested me was the size of a dog's eye sockets. K\u0101k\u0101 parrots also had large eyes. In fact, the eyes of a parrot were quite intelligent and expressive. \"Ancestors are supposed to be wise,\" I said. \"But they didn't leave us a single dog.\"",
      "Hine eyed its fangs. \"I'm glad they're gone.\"",
      "\"Parrots have sharp beaks,\" I said. \"And they're friendly.\" Hine took the skull and threw it.",
      "\"One of these days, you'll lose a finger to those birds,\" she said.",
      "Already, I've forgotten some stuff. That's how bad a storyteller I am. I should've mentioned that I was absolutely forbidden from teaching my parrots human words, that Hine had a father who was alive and walking around our island \u2014 we just didn't know his identity. That Papa Toki had lost an arm, with my mother and Tiri being the ones who cut it off.",
      "But it's too late, the story's begun. Aroha looked toward the cove, spread her wings, and began screeching. We turned. Drifting in past the reef was the largest waka canoe imaginable. It had two hulls and rocked silently with the waves. Most canoes in the old stories were waka taua, war canoes. This one seemed empty \u2014 not a person or a paddle or a sail was visible. We beheld its pitched bows and soaring mast. Most ominously, the symbol of a death-bringing frigate bird was carved down its side. Then we heard it: upon the spar was a large parrot with a crimson body. It had spread its wings and was screeching back.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked. \"What's going on?\"",
      "\"We have visitors,\" Hine said. She took my hand in hers, and then she screamed.",
      "It seemed to me that, at the sound of Hine's voice, dozens of warriors would sit up in the waka and reveal themselves. I took hold of my fishhook necklace because, like the waka before me, it felt both ancient and startlingly new.",
      "Did I mention that in all our years on the island, we'd never had a visitor? As Hine's scream echoed off the cliffs, the hum of island life stopped.",
      "Silenced were the sounds of flax being beaten on the leeward shore and of our fathers excavating burial sites on the south-facing bluffs.",
      "Our fathers \u2014 all the men of Bird Island \u2014 would be here in no time.",
      "I should say the waka wasn't a total surprise. We knew something was coming. There'd been signs.",

      "Dear Reader,",
      "You are eighteen years old. Cast out by your father, shunned by society, you have fled to Geneva with your lover and your sister. The closeness of their relationship makes you furious, but if you protest, your lover will abandon you. Confined by terrible storms, you find yourself in a house with your lover, your sister and Lord Byron, an infamous and magnetically attractive poet. You know he is dangerous, but you find yourself drawn to him. When he sets a challenge to write a ghost story, all the turmoil that has boiled within you finds a voice.",
      "The anger pours from your pen in a roar of rage. Even as the monster that emerges terrifies you, you understand that it belongs to you. This creature that crawls across the page is the woman you were always meant to be. And in Byron, this furious beast that you have kept hidden for so long may have found a mate. You are eighteen years old. The creature you have created will howl its way onto page and stage and screen, burning its path across history in its desire to be seen, to be known, to be loved. The monster will never be silenced. Neither will you.",

The ash fragments falling over the city form a strange fog \u2013 a thickening of the air, which swirls through the deserted streets, past the spire of the old cathedral and over the walls of the new Protestant church. Inside, people are on their knees, praying for the uncanny cloud to lift. It is a judgement, they fear, a punishment from God, or else a curse.",
      "This night, like so many before it, the choking dust has driven the residents of the city into the shelter of shuttered houses and places of prayer. Outside, there is no one to witness the way the ash gleams as it settles on the lake. The water flickers and shimmers, each tiny filament glowing like a candle, sinking into the silence, quickly snuffed out.",
      "The lake is chill and dark and deep \u2013 not even the fishermen have fathomed its depths, or the small children who, on any other evening, would be taking turns to dive beneath the surface, competing to see who could swim down the furthest, stay under the longest.",
      "No one is standing on the lake's stony shores to watch the water's surface glow, red as the strange sky above. No one is there to see the darkness beneath the water shift and stir and coalesce, parting for a breath, like two slick thighs, which fall back into the darkness with a gasp that is almost human.",
      "Above, half masked by cloud, a thin slash of moon hangs hazy and indifferent. A lone figure stumbles down to the lake and scrambles into a small rowboat that one of the fishermen has left bobbing at the end of a long line. Looking right, then left, the man leans forward over the rope. Flash of steel from the blade in his hand. A quick tug and the boat is free. The man settles himself on the rocking boards, tugging the oars. No one will see him on this cloud-deadened, mist-muffled night. No one will stop him. Still, his breath stutters and stumbles. He must be quick. His hands ache, his chest burns. His eyes feel gritty as the mist parts before him, then closes around him, giving him the strange sensation of being swallowed.",

      "A National Book Award finalist, Megha Majumdar's \"A Guardian and a Thief\"\u00a0(Knopf) is set in India in a climate-ravaged near-future, in which mother preparing to move her family to America awakens to discover that a starving young man has stolen all\u00a0their passports \u2014 plunging her into seven days of desperation and moral reckoning.",
      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"A Guardian and a Thief\" by Megha Majumdar",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "From the storeroom hidden under the stairs, Ma fetched a cup of rice and a sack of eggs speckled gray like the moon, then cooked, standing before the stove's blue fire, her eye upon the window and its dusk, in which bats swooped and the neem tree shivered and a figure down on the road pedaled a bicycle, whistling, as if everything was all right.",
      "Thief, thought Ma. Who else but a person who had chanced upon fresh vegetables or fruit would wander the city of Kolkata in this ruined year, the heat a hand clamped upon the mouth, the sun a pistol against one's head, and recall a song? She watched to see what the thief would do. He pedaled past. But Ma saw a different reality shimmer into being, in which he leaned his bicycle against the wall, climbed the pipes like a toddy tapper, and appeared at her window. In that picture, the thief was a collector of local information, dutiful in his neighborhood eavesdropping, shrewd in following what he heard about the bins of onions and carrots, the sacks of lentils and rice, the bags of raisins and cashews hidden in the dark fist of the house, stolen by Ma from donations made to the shelter where she worked, while the city outside wept for a handful of something to eat.",
      "There was \u2014 in the label accepted by the region \u2014 a shortage.",
      "In the year prior to this day, farmers across the region had fallen, their bodies running fevers in air that no longer cooled. In the croplands, among stilled machines, pests had traveled from acre to new acre, savage in their feeding of grains. In the west a drought had cleaved riverbeds and in the east salt water had tainted the paddy fields. In the city, those who walked to the neighborhood markets with umbrellas in their hands and wishful lists in their pockets, broad corners torn from the newspaper with writing in Bengali \u2014 cabbage, ginger, lychees if they were good, ice cream, half loaf of bread \u2014 found the roads alongside which the markets usually sat, its baskets and tarps invading, rickshaws and cars sounding their horns, slow shoppers inspecting the purple shine of eggplant and pressing guavas hard as hail, instead completely empty, nothing but some onion peel scattered at the edges where the pavement gave way to earth, where on most days goats and cows might have nudged the soil for something to eat. But those animals were gone too.",
      "It had happened before. 1770, when crops failed and smallpox plagued the enfeebled. 1876, when drought struck the Deccan Plateau and the British continued to export what grain remained. 1943. Those black-and-white newspaper photos, in which people appeared as sunken eyes and twig-thin limbs, facing a photographer who could do nothing for them, their fullness \u2014 their love, their humor, their annoyance, their preference \u2014 pared by the lens to reveal what remained, which was hunger.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the agency may need to close \"certain parts\" of the nation's airspace if the shutdown drags on.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation may need to close \"certain parts of the airspace\" if the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on record continues into next week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" Duffy said at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",
      "He added, \"We will restrict the airspace when we feel it's not safe.\"",
      "Throughout the 35-day federal shutdown, set to become the longest in U.S. history, Duffy has maintained that commercial air travel remains safe. The tradeoff is that passengers are experiencing more flight delays as officials slow flight traffic based on staffing levels to ensure that the national airspace remains well-monitored, Duffy\u00a0has said at earlier press conferences.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while an additional 4,700 trips were delayed on Monday, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "Duffy said on social media on Wednesday that 46% of the previous day's flight delays were due to staffing issues in air traffic control towers. Ordinarily, personnel issues account for roughly 5% of such delays, according to aviation data.",
      "\"Draconian steps\"?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights following the\u00a09/11 terror attacks for national security reasons, while hurricanes and other weather emergencies can also lead to flight restrictions. But closing parts of the nation's airspace because of staffing issues would be unprecedented, according to aviation industry experts.",
      "\"In this particular instance, Duffy is talking about staffing. He knows the strain and stress this is taking on air traffic controllers,\" Sheldon Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and an expert on aviation security, told CBS News.",
      "Closing even a portion of the nation's vast airspace would be a major step and likely impact travel nationwide, he added. The system operates on a so-called hub-and-spoke model in which passengers using regional airports can connect with major airports to travel around the U.S.",
      "If the airspace around New York were to close, for example, it could affect passengers in multiple cities, according to Jacobson.",
      "\"For us to take such draconian steps to shut it down in sectors of the country would be unprecedented,\" he said. \"If you shut down the New York area, you shut down a lot of the country because of the interconnectivity of the hub-and-spoke system.\"",
      "More controllers calling in sick",
      "With air traffic controllers working without pay during the shutdown, more than usual are calling in sick, Duffy has said. He has said he is discouraging them from taking on side gigs like delivering for Uber or DoorDash to make ends meet during the funding lapse, given the level of focus that their job requires.",
      "\"The longer this goes on, every day, these hardworking Americans have bills they have to pay, and they're being forced to make decisions and choices,\" Duffy said Tuesday. \"As every day goes by, I think the problem is going to only get worse. Not better.\"",
      "At an Oct. 28 news conference at LaGuardia Airport in New York, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels emphasized that his organization's members are under mounting financial pressures.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "The U.S. Travel Association on Monday urged congressional leaders to end the shutdown, which the industry trade group said could disrupt passengers during the busy Thanksgiving holiday. In 2024, 20 million passengers took to the skies over that week.",
      "\"A shutdown places extraordinary strain on federal personnel who are essential to keeping America moving \u2014 from Transportation Security Administration officers to air traffic controllers, who are forced to work without pay,\" the group said in a Nov. 3 letter. \"When staffing shortages worsen, airport wait times grow longer and flight delays and cancellations become more frequent, threatening to derail family travel plans across the country.\"",

      "A plan announced Monday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide partial\u00a0food stamp benefits for November during the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0could offer a measure of relief to millions of Americans. Yet the move still leaves participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the dark on exactly when they will get the funds.",
      "In a\u00a0declaration\u00a0submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said $4.6 billion in contingency USDA funds will be used to cover 50% of SNAP recipients' benefits.",
      "However, the USDA declaration said that procedural changes U.S. states must make in order to issue partial benefits could take \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months.\" A spokesperson for the USDA referred CBS News to a social media\u00a0post\u00a0from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, which also says benefits could take several weeks to arrive.",
      "It's unclear how long it will take some states to issue SNAP payments since this is an unprecedented situation, said Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. The timing will depend on how fast states can adjust to issue partial SNAP benefits and relay that information to EBT vendors, she added.",
      "\"I would hope that states will move heaven and Earth to get SNAP benefits flowing as quickly as possible,\" she said.",
      "The White House referred CBS News to the Office of Management and Budget, which also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "President Trump wrote Tuesday in a Truth Social post that benefits will go out only when Democrats vote to end the ongoing government shutdown. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified at a press conference later in the day that Mr. Trump was referring to future SNAP payments.",
      "\"He does not want to have to keep tapping into an emergency fund and depleting it in the case of a catastrophe in this country,\" she said.",
      "With questions continuing to swirl around the SNAP program, attention has turned to how this uncertainty directly affects people on food stamps. CBS News spoke with three people about how losing access to federal food aid could affect them. They reside in states that have committed to sending emergency funds to local food banks to assist families enrolled in SNAP.",
      "Shatika Griffin, 45",
      "Buffalo, New York, resident Shatika Griffin, 45, said she relies on both SNAP and the Women, Infants and Children program,\u00a0to support herself and seven children, including an 11-year-old son who is autistic.",
      "\"I'm a single mom, so it's very frightening,\" Griffin said of missing out on federal nutrition assistance. \"All the kids know is, 'I'm hungry.'\"",
      "Griffin said she typically uses the $1,100 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to pay for food staples she can stretch out for the month, such as spaghetti and canned goods. Without the money, she plans to turn to a local food bank.",
      "Although her mother helps with child care, Griffin said her support network is limited. \"Everything is falling on my shoulders,\" she told CBS News.",

      "In May of 2024, however, a hit-and-run accident required multiple surgeries and left the 64-year-old Lennox unable to work. Without a stable source of income, Lennox said she relies on SNAP, disability and Social Security retirement benefits to pay the bills. She plans to return to work as soon as she's physically capable, saying she needs a job to help cover her medical expenses.",

      "After learning that SNAP funding was under threat because of the shutdown, Lennox said she pulled back on buying food by conserving the remaining food stamps on her electronic benefits card. She currently has $240 in food stamp payments, but plans on visiting a local food bank to make ends meet.",

Newark Liberty Airport on Sunday had a four-hour ground delay, while staffing triggers \u2014 a Federal Aviation Administration alert system to indicate an air traffic control facility is understaffed \u2014 were reported at airports including Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; and Denver, Colorado.",
      "Airport delays are \"going to get worse,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday.",

      "\"We're over a month into this shutdown, and in the last few days is really when we've started to see that the seams are ripping,\" Nastro said. \"It's not just in air traffic control staffing triggers, but we're seeing TSA lines hit the 3-4 hour mark.\"",

      "If the shutdown drags longer into November, the real pain point could come during Thanksgiving week, when a record number of Americans are expected to travel for the holidays, Nastro said.",
      "\"I would be cautious if this continues into Thanksgiving \u2014 we're likely to see multiple days of 3 million-plus travelers,\" she said. \"At that point, we would be coming into almost two months of a shutdown.\"",
      "Some holiday travelers might be better off driving to their destinations given the potential for flight disruptions, Nastro added. Booking early morning flights, such as those that depart between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., can also help minimize delays because these departures are more likely to be on time than flights that are scheduled later in the day, travel data shows.",
      "Still, experts said that air safety isn't an issue, given that the FAA will slow flights if there aren't enough air traffic controllers directing flights.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aca-marketplace-obamacare-health-insurance-premiums-2026-increase-sticker-shock/",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Nov 2025 16:36:58 -0500",
    "summary": "In 2026, premiums for a typical health insurance plan sold through the ACA marketplaces are projected to jump an average of 26%.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act marketplaces opened for enrollment on Nov. 1, with the average premium for a mid-level insurance plan surging 26% this year to $625 per month, according to nonprofit health research firm KFF.",
      "That jump \u2014 the biggest increase in ACA plan rates since 2018 \u2014 is causing sticker shock for some people who rely on the program for health insurance coverage.",
      "\"I've been hearing stories about the price increases, so I've been dreading this week,\" Jeremy Tolbert, a 47-year-old web developer in Lawrence, Kansas, told CBS News. When he logged into his state's marketplace, he was dismayed to find out that his current plan's monthly premium is set to rise to $2,600 a month next year, up from $2,200 a month in 2025.",
      "That doesn't include higher cost-sharing for his family, such as a larger out-of-pocket maximum for 2026, meaning he's facing higher costs on both ends for the same coverage for himself, his wife and their 11-year-old son.",
      "\"I already pay a significant portion of my income for this insurance,\" he noted. \"What the hell am I paying for at this point?\"",
      "Roughly 24 million Americans get their health insurance through an ACA plan.",
      "The 26% premium hike for so-called ACA silver plans reflects what insurers are charging consumers buying plans via the marketplaces. Millions of Americans currently pay below the ACA's market rates because of\u00a0premium tax credits, KFF said. Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025 \u2014 a looming deadline that has contributed to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, as Democratic lawmakers push for Republicans to agree to an extension.",
      "The roughly 22 million people who currently rely on the premium tax credits could see their ACA plan costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",
      "Even those who don't qualify for the credits, as in Tolbert's case, face sharply higher health insurance costs next year, KFF said. The main factors behind that increase are increased demand for costly treatments, such as\u00a0GLP-1 drugs\u00a0for weight loss; higher prices from hospitals and other providers; and insurer projections that millions of people could drop their coverage next year when the premium tax credits expire, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of KFF's program on the ACA.",
      "\"The biggest factor is that health care costs for everybody are going up,\" Cox told CBS News. \"That's driven by the underlying health care costs, hospital costs, doctor visits and drugs.\"",
      "\"The last time we saw premium increases like this was 2017, going into 2018, when we were talking about ACA 'repeal and replace,'\" a period during President Trump's first term when he\u00a0sought to roll back the Affordable Care Act, she added.",
      "Higher ACA insurance costs could spur some people to go without coverage, said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Biden administration.",
      "\"Some will have to go to skimpier plans,\" she noted in a recent conference call organized by left-leaning economic advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative to discuss the ACA premium tax credit expiration. \"Deductibles are going up as well ... [consumers] will be heading into next year with bigger out-of-pocket expenses.\"",
      "For some people, going without health coverage might seem like a financial necessity in the face of sharply higher ACA plan costs in 2026, but ultimately could prove ruinous, KFF's Cox said. \"It's like gambling with your health and your wallet,\" she added. \"You don't know what will happen.\"",
      "In the meantime, Tolbert expressed concern that ACA insurance may become unaffordable for his family if premiums continue to increase at the same pace. That could push him or his wife, who currently stays at home with their son, to look for a job with a bigger employer to secure health insurance, he noted.",
      "\"At this rate, I have one to three more years before I can no longer afford a plan,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Department of Agriculture told a federal court that it will tap into a contingency fund to allow states to issue partial November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\"",
      "There is roughly $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover November benefit payments, according to Penn. Officials have said fully covering those benefits would require roughly $9 billion. The $4.6 billion will be used to \"cover 50% of eligible households' current allotments,\" Penn said.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to buy food, and the program ran out of funding over the weekend due to the ongoing shutdown. The federal government funds SNAP by sending money to the states, which oversee food stamp programs for their residents.",
      "Justice Department lawyers separately told the court that the administration will \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds\" by providing states with information on Monday that they can use to calculate benefits due to each eligible household.",
      "The administration said it will \"have made the necessary funds available and have authorized the states to begin disbursements\" once the material has been issued.",
      "Still, relief to food-aid recipients may not be immediate. Penn wrote in his declaration that there could be \"payment errors and significant delays\" because of variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "\"For at least some States, USDA's understanding is that the system changes States must implement to provide the reduced benefit amounts will take anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months,\" he said.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy group that is representing a group of municipalities and nonprofit organizations that sued the Trump administration, said in a statement it is \"considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.\"",
      "\"It shouldn't take a court order to force our president to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided. But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people,\" Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, pushed the administration to transfer money from other programs to fully fund November benefits, saying the courts \"have made it clear\" that the government has the authority to do so.",
      "\"It is not enough to do the bare minimum \u2014 the administration should stop playing politics with hunger and use all available resources to ensure Americans can put food on the table,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.",
      "The USDA filing came in response to an order issued by Judge John McConnell, who is overseeing the case brought by nonprofits and municipalities in Rhode Island. Last Friday, McConnell ordered the Trump administration to tap into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP funding caused by the shutdown. The judge gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the funds.",
      "In a separate case in Massachusetts, two dozen states and the District of Columbia filed suit to get the administration to use the contingency funds. The judge in that case agreed with their argument that the government is required to use the money and likewise asked for an update by Monday.",
      "The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress had argued that the contingency fund couldn't legally be used to pay SNAP benefits because the underlying appropriation for the program had lapsed. Both judges disagreed with that argument and said the fund must be used to cover part of the shortfall.",
      "\"There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown,\" McConnell wrote in the written version of his order on Saturday.",
      "He also said the government should \"find the additional funds necessary (beyond the contingency funds) to fully fund the November SNAP payments.\" The $5 billion in the contingency fund does not fully cover the $9 billion needed to pay out benefits for the month, and the administration had argued that calculating partial payments would be \"exceedingly difficult, highly disruptive, and delayed.\"",
      "The judge said the government could choose to issue partial payments instead of finding other sources of funding, but added that \"under no circumstances\" could those payments be delayed beyond Wednesday.",
      "The USDA warned late last month that federal food benefits would not go out to roughly 42 million recipients on Nov. 1 after it declined to tap into contingency funds to keep food stamp payments flowing during the shutdown. The agency pinned the blame for the pause on congressional Democrats for failing to back a GOP-backed stopgap measure that would fund federal agencies.",
      "The shutdown entered its 34th day Monday and is poised to become the longest shutdown in U.S. history if lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a spending measure by late Tuesday.",
      "The initial decision to halt the food aid appeared to be a shift from the USDA's plan for a lapse in federal funding that was issued Sept. 30. The agency said in its plan that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits\" in the event of a funding lapse.",
      "But the USDA wrote in a memo to states late last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to over regular benefits,\" and said the money was meant for priorities like assisting people in disaster areas.",
      "Faced with the looming cutoff of food stamp payments, half the states and the District of Columbia, as well as the municipalities, sought relief from the federal courts. Some states said they would work to continue providing assistance to food-aid beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps.",

      "New York Times financial columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin's \"1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History - and How It Shattered a Nation\" (Viking) looks back to the nation's most catastrophic market collapse.",
      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"1929\" by Andrew Ross Sorkin",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Charles Mitchell strode up the steps of 55 Wall Street, determined to project his usual sense of confidence and certitude. It had been a crushing afternoon. As he returned to his office, he knew that the eyes of Wall Street were on him \u2014 everyone from the traders in the street to his own secretary was assessing his gait and searching his face, trying to read meaning into every twitch, every line, every wrinkle.",
      "In his gray three\u2011piece suit, shoulders back, Mitchell kept up his smile as he passed through the glass\u2011domed central hall of his National City Bank. With its eighty\u2011three\u2011foot ceiling and two solid bronze doors protecting a safe weighing some three hundred tons, the bank was the largest in the country.",
      "It was just past 5:30 p.m. on Monday, October 28, 1929. Hours earlier, the stock market had closed with a sharp, dizzying drop of 13 percent after a week of downward convulsions; today was by far the greatest fall. The darkening downtown streets still teemed with anxious brokers in their fedoras and flat caps, messenger boys and switchboard girls, all gossiping and speculating about the collapse. What caused the fall? How much further might it go tomorrow? Would the markets even open?",
      "As Mitchell made his way to his office, the teller windows he passed reflected the weary puffiness under his eyes and his disheveled, graying eyebrows. He collapsed into the chair behind his mahogany desk. The room was furnished with the high formality befitting an eighteenth\u2011century statesman: antique wood chairs, a grandfather clock that stood against the cream\u2011white woodwork flanked by portraits of George Washington orchestrating the newly independent nation with the purpose and resolve that Mitchell sought to emulate in his own life.",
      "The athletic fifty\u2011two\u2011year\u2011old bank chairman \u2014 an unusually optimistic man whom the press called \"Sunshine Charlie\" \u2014 had spent the afternoon in emergency meetings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, puzzling over how to calm the market. It was a moment for which a self\u2011consciously Great Man like Mitchell should have been utterly prepared. He had the experience, the stature, and the steely nerves necessary to steer Wall Street through these tough times.",
      "Yet he felt exposed, vulnerable.",
      "But he didn't have time to consider his emotional state.",
      "He walked upstairs to confer with Hugh Baker, who ran National City's stock\u2011trading unit.",
      "Baker, a tall, bald man with piercing eyes, began to explain to Mitchell, calmly, if somewhat obliquely, what had taken place while Mitchell had been at the Federal Reserve.",
      "\"Our portfolio today has been tremendously increased in our holdings of National City Bank stock,\" Baker told him.",
      "Mitchell stared at him, waiting to hear exactly what he meant.",
      "Baker finally blurted out: \"We purchased seventy\u2011odd thousand shares.\"",
      "Mitchell, who could calculate numbers instantly in his head, immediately grasped the nature and scale of the problem. That is unbelievable, he thought. The bank didn't have the cash to pay for so many shares. He was outraged \u2014 and terrified. Everything he had built was suddenly at grave risk of collapse.",
      "Barely a month earlier, Mitchell had been on top of the world. He had finalized an agreement to take over the Corn Exchange Bank, a bold acquisition that would turn National City from the largest bank in the country into the largest in the world, stealing the mantle from London and helping New York finally eclipse its rival city as the world financial center. This was history in the making, an overthrow of the established order, the kind of gambit that made Mitchell a king among men.",
      "But to pull off the deal, Mitchell had made a big \u2014 and risky \u2014 bet on the strength of his own stock. Corn Exchange shareholders could take $360 in cash for each of their shares, or four fifths of a share in National City Bank. On paper, the stock was the better deal: As long as National City stock stayed above $450, four fifths of a share was worth more than $360 in cash. At the time the deal was struck, it was comfortably higher, trading at $496 a share. Mitchell needed it to stay there until the deal could be completed, likely in the next month \u2014 because, in truth, National City didn't have the cash to pay everyone, a crucial detail he kept to himself.",
      "So he quietly instructed his traders to buy the bank's shares whenever the price slipped.",
      "In a relatively stable market, this posed no problem. Big publicly traded companies bought back their own shares all the time. In a rapidly falling market, however, doing so could quickly become like shoveling money into a furnace, which was what had been happening that afternoon. In the chaos of all that selling pressure, National City's bids had been accepted so quickly that they lost track of how many they had amassed. By the time traders got a handle on the situation, National City had committed to buy seventy\u2011one thousand of its own shares, far more than it could afford to hold.",
      "\"With that news,\" he told Baker, \"I could be knocked over with a feather.\"",
      "There were very few good options. To fund their daily operations, big banks like National City had to constantly borrow against their assets. But banking law prevented them from offering their own stock as collateral. Thus, those seventy\u2011one thousand shares \u2014 which cost about $32 million \u2014 were a deadweight that could possibly take down the whole bank.",
      "\"It would be embarrassing for us to attempt to borrow on that stock in other banks,\" Mitchell said, knowing full well that his rivals would seize on any such move as a sign of vulnerability. With the market in free fall, short sellers \u2014 traders who bet that stocks would go down \u2014 were lining up targets, probing for weakness.",
      "The stock market was at the breaking point. Sales volume had overwhelmed the human apparatus of the trading floor to such an extent that, on the previous Thursday, the ticker had fallen four hours behind in reporting stock prices, more than twice the longest previous delay.",
      "What this meant was that the big board of prices that loomed over the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was hopelessly inaccurate. Trading stocks in this environment was like being a gambler at a baseball game in the eighth inning and looking at a scoreboard that hadn't been updated since the third, while everybody around you was shouting conflicting opinions about which team was ahead and by how much. The prices of stocks sold privately \u2014 known as \"off\u2011exchange,\" which was the case with National City shares \u2014 were even further behind because they were tied to the broader market's movements without being fully updated in real time, exacerbating the delay. For Wall Street traders, the only prudent decision was to sell and get the hell out of the market. Which is exactly what they were doing.",
      "Mitchell knew that if he tried to unload even a small fraction of National City's position back into such a weak market, rumors would begin to fly about the bank's solvency, and that could easily turn into a vicious cycle that would be impossible to stop. If prices declined fast enough, it could trigger a much larger crisis: A \"lack of confidence might bring a run,\" Mitchell told Baker, envisioning depositors lining up outside every one of its fifty\u2011eight branches around the country.",
      "A run on the country's largest bank. There was nothing bankers feared more.",

      "The wealthy emirate is known for its extravagant ventures, including an enormous mall with an indoor ski area, the world's tallest building and an artificial island dotted with five-star hotels.",
      "\"The wait is finally over,\" Serkan Sagsoz, co-founder of the Julith cafe with the pricey offering,\u00a0said in a Facebook video. \"The world's most celebrated and highest graded coffee of all time has arrived at Julith.\"",
      "Located in an industrial neighborhood that has become a hotspot for coffee lovers, Julith plans to serve \"around 400 cups\" of the precious beverage starting on Saturday, Sagsoz told AFP.",
      "\"We felt Dubai was the perfect place for our investment,\" Sagsoz said.",
      "For a price tag of 3,600 dirhams (around $980), the brew offers an experience of floral and fruity flavors reminiscent of tea.",
      "\"There are white floral notes like jasmine, citrus flavors like orange and bergamot and a hint of apricot and peach,\" said Sagsoz, who previously ran a cafe in his native Turkey.",
      "\"It's like honey, delicate and sweet,\" he said.",

      "It claimed to have paid the highest price ever for coffee.",

      "Several factors are driving this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, is depressing crop yields, Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023, the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according\u00a0to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, which has led producers there to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Nov 2025 07:43:48 -0400",
    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mother living in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Saturday isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation\u00a0and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

      "SNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Nov. 1 isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "With just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.",
      "Will current SNAP benefits roll over to November?",
      "While SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.",
      "Some states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.",
      "\"If you have remaining balances from previous months, we encourage you to plan your shopping carefully and purchase essential food items when needed,\" Hawaii's Department of Human Services said on its website.",
      "Will SNAP recipients get paid retroactively for missed payments?",
      "The USDA hasn't indicated whether SNAP benefits would be paid retroactively once the government shutdown ends.",
      "But social service experts who spoke with CBS News said they expect the USDA to pay the delayed November benefits once federal funding resumes.",
      "\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.",
      "Federal rules\u00a0governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.",
      "\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Can states step in to fund SNAP?",
      "While SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.",
      "Some states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers\u00a0urging\u00a0Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0sued the Trump administration\u00a0over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.",
      "In recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u00a0signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.",
      "Other states say they plan to ramp up support for local food banks by providing on-site personnel and additional funding. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said\u00a0last week he would deploy National Guard troops to assist food bank operations and fast-track $80 million to keep the state's food banks stocked.",
      "In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is providing $30 million in state funding to support 16 million meals. Roughly 3 million people in New York are on food stamps.",
      "Other states that have announced actions to help SNAP recipients include\u00a0Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia\u00a0and\u00a0Washington.",
      "Officials in these states are stepping in despite the USDA saying states lack the authority to cover benefits and won't be reimbursed.",
      "\"There is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed,\" the agency said in its memo.",
      "Plata-Nino said that puts states in a difficult position, given their already limited reserves. It also diverts attention and funding from other priorities, she added.",
      "\"These are resources that could have gone to other places,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are sliding toward a financial cliff as the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0stretches into a second month, with four federal assistance programs for low-income families set to run out of funding on Nov. 1.",
      "Some families could lose access to multiple sources of government support. Ashley Trent, a 37-year-old single mother of six, expressed concern she could soon be without aid provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, which provides food aid for mothers of young children.",
      "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything,\" Trent, a Bloomington, Ill., resident who works full-time as a housing navigator, told CBS News. \"It's very stressful \u2014 what bills will I have to put off? I have a car note, I have insurance, I have clothes I have to get my kids because it's getting colder.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds SNAP and WIC, has said it will halt payments for the anti-hunger programs on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. Head Start programs serving 65,000 low-income children will also lose federal funding on Saturday, potentially disrupting preschool for thousands of families,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Head Start Association.",
      "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps struggling households heat their homes, could be next to run short of funding.",
      "Halting funding for these programs \u2014 which help cover food, education, and energy costs \u2014 could have lasting consequences for poor families already strained by high grocery and utility prices, said Ailen Arreaza, executive director of the advocacy group ParentsTogether Action.",
      "Although funding will resume once Congress passes legislation to reopen the government, she warned that the damage to households could persist.",
      "\"What we are hearing from parents is desperation \u2014 parents going without meals, making impossible decisions about not paying bills or going without medication,\" Arreaza told CBS News. \"This has so many implications, because these kids need these programs to get ahead.\"",
      "Experts note that hunger can hinder children's ability to learn, while parents who fall behind on bills may face utility shutoffs or other lasting setbacks.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The USDA is set to\u00a0halt SNAP payments on Nov. 1, leaving about 42 million Americans uncertain how they'll afford groceries next month. Recipients receive an average of about $187 a month on prepaid cards that can be used to buy food at grocery stores, farmers' markets and other retailers.",
      "A prolonged cessation in food-stamp funding isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday that the Trump administration is required by law to use contingency funds to pay at least partial SNAP benefits. The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Meanwhile, more than a dozen states are trying to fill the gap by using state funds to support food aid or local food banks. But food bank leaders say charities can't make up for a cutoff in food stamps.",
      "\"It's going to hurt us really bad,\" said Taylour Grant, 29, a Tampa medical assistant who relies on $970 a month in SNAP benefits to feed her four children, plus WIC support for her youngest, who is 1-year-old. \"It's really scary because I know I'll go without to make sure my kids are fed.\"",
      "Grant said many people misunderstand who relies on SNAP. \"We're not on it because we want to be \u2014 no one makes enough to live off these days. That help is really needed,\" she said.",
      "WIC",
      "Nearly 7 million low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children under 5 who receive WIC could lose federal aid in November because of the government shutdown.",
      "Unlike food stamps, WIC provides funds specifically to purchase formula and nutritious foods for pregnant women and young children, though many families rely on both programs, said Georgia Machell, CEO of the National WIC Association.",
      "\"None of these programs operate in a vacuum,\" she said. \"Often, if a family is participating in WIC, they're also participating in SNAP.\"",
      "WIC continued paying benefits in October after the Trump administration tapped\u00a0$300 million\u00a0in leftover tariff revenue from the previous fiscal year. But with the stalemate in Congress continuing into November, that funding could run out.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it could tap additional tariff revenue to fund the program. At this point, the program is set to delay payments on Nov. 1, according to the National WIC Association.",
      "WIC has been able to maintain funding during previous shutdowns in its 50-year history, according to the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on stopping hunger. \"The disruptions we're concerned about would be fairly historic,\" Machell said.",
      "Some states have pledged to use their own funds to keep WIC running, but many lack the budget, according to FRAC.",
      "Head Start",
      "About 140 Head Start programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will lose federal funding with the shutdown set to extend past Nov. 1, affecting roughly 65,000 children, according to the National Head Start Association. Nationwide, about 750,000 children are enrolled in Head Start.",
      "Some programs may not be able to stay open, regional program directors warn.",
      "\"Everybody is trying to do everything they can to keep children in classrooms and families at work,\" Michelle Haimowitz, executive director of the Massachusetts Head Start Association,\u00a0told CBS News Boston. \"But it is incredibly difficult to operate without those federal funds.\"",
      "Minnesota mother Jaycee Chrudimsky said she fears that the closure of her local Head Start program could force her to miss work and affect her 4-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It would impact her, and that's the thing I worry about the most, because she looks forward to coming to school every single day and seeing her friends and being a part of the program,\" Chrudimsky\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota this week.",
      "LIHEAP",
      "Another program threatened by the shutdown is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The program helps about 6 million low-income households pay their energy bills.",
      "\"We are now at a point where the government shutdown is going to cause serious delays in the release of LIHEAP funds,\" Wolfe told CBS News.",
      "The delay could leave millions of families behind on utility bills and facing power shutoffs just as\u00a0energy prices are skyrocketing, he added.",
      "NEADA projects the\u00a0average cost for people to heat a home this winter\u00a0will rise nearly 8%.",
      "\"It's a perfect storm of misery for low- and middle-income households,\" Wolfe said.",

    "summary": "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol doesn't expect AI to replace baristas as the coffee chain focuses on improving the \"human-to-human experience\" for customers.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol took the helm in September 2024, inheriting a company facing its first revenue decline in four years amid customer complaints about high prices and long wait times. A year later, the coffee giant has halted the slide but faces fresh pressures, from surging coffee bean costs to store closures.",
      "Coffee prices\u00a0jumped 30% from January through September, squeezing Starbucks' profit margins even as Niccol vowed not to raise menu costs this year. The restaurant chain said last month it would spend $1 billion to close underperforming stores and cut 900 jobs.",
      "As Niccol told CBS News' Jo Ling Kent, the retail chain can't rule out price hikes in 2026 due to rising coffee prices, although he described this step as a \"last resort.\" At the same time, Niccol noted that Starbucks has no plans to introduce a value menu like McDonald's and other fast-food chains appealing to budget-conscious patrons.",
      "\"We have a huge point of difference and that is, I think, that customer connection and the experience you get in our stores,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"I just believe, at the end of the day, the experience sets us apart from everybody else.\"",
      "He added, \"Pricing would be one of those things that we do as a last resort, and we do it very surgically. To say never, you know, I don't think you can do that in this environment.\"",
      "\"Human-to-human\"",
      "Starbucks' reboot involves what the company calls its \"Green Apron service model,\" which aims to hire more baristas, improve customer service and cut down on customer wait times.",
      "\"What we're doing right now is making sure that we're staffed correctly,\" Niccol said. \"The teams are trained correctly for the demand that we know we have in the morning, and we know that we're growing in the afternoon.\"",
      "While other companies are turning to artificial intelligence to replace some workers, Niccol said he doesn't envision AI supplanting baristas. He said the technology could be useful for behind-the-scenes tasks, such as managing the company's supply chain.",
      "\"I don't see [AI] replacing our baristas \u2014 that human-to-human experience is just too important,\" Niccol said. \"And I think it really separates our experience from everybody else.\"",
      "While Starbucks is bolstering its barista ranks, it also faces the threat of strikes from Starbucks Workers United, which represents 9,500 workers in some 550 Starbucks cafes across the country. Overall, the company has roughly 201,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Niccol said he's open to talking with union members, but also described his company's pay and benefits as generous, adding that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",
      "\"We already give them the best job in retail. We have the lowest turnover in the industry \u2014 it's below 50%,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"We also have the best benefits in the industry, and we actually have the best wages in the industry.\"",
      "Although other companies have noted a pullback from low- or middle-income consumers as inflation continues to tick upwards, Niccols said Starbucks patrons are still opening their wallets.",
      "\"Transactions are up, our sales are up,\" Niccol said. \"What we hear from them is they love the experience and they think it's a great value proposition, so I think they're being much more judicious in where they want to spend their money.\"",
      "He added, \"And I think it's really important that you give them a great experience so that it justifies why they chose to spend money with you.\"",

Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",

      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 9,500\u00a0workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in May 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",

      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

    "story": [
      "Diane Reynolds said she was caught off guard when someone contacted the Maryland retiree online and said access to her computer had been blocked for safety reasons.",
      "\"There was a voice message that was coming on with this that said, 'Don't turn your computer on, don't turn your computer off,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Reynolds was also instructed to call a phone number she was led to believe would provide her with tech support. Instead, she was connected to a\u00a0scam artist\u00a0who claimed that hackers had obtained access to her bank account. The only way to protect her money was to convert the funds into bitcoin, the person told Reynolds.",
      "She withdrew her entire bank account balance, which totaled $13,100, and followed the scammer's directions to go to a bitcoin ATM at a nearby gas station. The ATM was operated by Athena Bitcoin, which has more than 4,000 such terminals across the U.S.",
      "Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb said such incidents highlight the surge in cryptocurrency scams linked to bitcoin ATM providers, resulting in the theft of millions of dollars.",
      "\"Bitcoin ATMs are a tool that scammers, that criminals, are using to separate people, including D.C. residents, from their hard-earned money,\" Schwalb told CBS News. \"Athena, as a bitcoin operator, knows that its kiosks are being used by this element, and yet [has] failed to put proper anti-fraud prevention systems in place to keep it from happening.\"",
      "He added, \"What makes it worse is they are profiting from this because they're charging very substantial fees.\"",
      "Schwalb in September filed a lawsuit against Athena, alleging that it charges \"undisclosed fees on deposits that it knows are often the result of scams, and for failing to implement adequate anti-fraud measures.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Athena Bitcoin said it \"strongly disagrees with the allegations\" and that it will contest the charges in court.",
      "\"We employ aggressive safety protocols to protect the financial interests of our customers. ...Our kiosks employ multiple safeguards, from prominent warnings and daily transaction limits to five separate verification screens designed to stop coerced transactions,\" the company said.",
      "Reynolds is also suing Athena Bitcoin. Her attorney, Vaught Stewart, accused the company of \"not just allowing the fraud to happen \u2014 they're profiting from it.\"",
      "In Washington, D.C., Athena Bitcoin charged fees of up to 26% per transaction, while 93% of all deposits made through the company's ATMs are linked to scams, Schwalb alleged in his suit.",
      "For her part, Reynolds wants to help others avoid losing their savings. \"Now I'm an advocate for just telling people this is real,\" she said. \"Be aware.\"",

      "Billie Eilish wants billionaires to donate more.",
      "As the Grammy and Oscar winner accepted the music award at this year's WSJ. Magazine Innovator Awards on Wednesday night, she urged the ultra-wealthy to address more of the world's issues.",
      "\"We're in a time right now where the world is really, really bad and really dark and people need empathy and help more than, kind of, ever, especially in our country,\" Eilish said to an audience that included Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, as well as \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas. \"I'd say if you have money, it would be great to use it for good things, maybe give it to some people that need it.\"",
      "Late-night host Stephen Colbert\u00a0introduced Eilish onstage at New York's Museum of Modern Art by announcing that she would donate $11.5 million of the proceeds from her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour to causes dedicated to food equity, climate justice and reducing carbon pollution.",
      "In accepting the award, the \"Bad Guy\" singer added a polite but direct call to others in the room, saying a lot of people, especially in the U.S., could use some help right now.",
      "\"Love you all, but there's a few people in here who have a lot more money than me,\" she said, to a smattering of applause. \"And if you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? And no hate, but give your money away, shorties.\"",
      "Through her Changemaker Program, Eilish has worked with the nonprofit Reverb for years on its Music Decarbonization Project and its Music Climate Revolution initiative, alongside artists ranging from Dead & Company to Harry Styles.",
      "Chan was also honored at the event, receiving the \"Philanthropy of Science Innovator of the Year\" award. A spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Brandi Hoffine Barr, said Zuckerberg and Chan have committed to giving away 99% of their Meta shares to philanthropy over the course of their lifetimes and have already granted out $7 billion. According to Forbes, Zuckerberg's current net worth is around $224 billion.",
      "Eilish's comments come as the number of billionaires worldwide continues to grow, with 204 new billionaires added in 2024, according to a January report from\u00a0Oxfam International titled \"Takers Not Makers.\"",
      "The report found that the billionaires grew wealthier three times faster in 2024 than in 2023, pointing to an increased concentration of resources globally.",
      "Oxfam predicted that at least five people will become trillionaires in the next decade, up from one person the year before. The group called for higher taxes on the rich and other measures to break up monopolies, cap CEO pay and require companies to pay living wages.",
      "The wealthiest Americans have a long history of calling on each other to give away more of their money. In 1889, the steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie argued in the essay \"The Gospel of Wealth\" that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "In 2010,\u00a0Bill Gates,\u00a0Melinda French Gates\u00a0and\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0took up that call by creating the\u00a0Giving Pledge, a commitment for billionaires to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetimes or when they die.",
      "Fifteen years on, some 256 billionaires have taken the pledge, with 110 of them coming from the U.S., according to a recent\u00a0report by the Charity Reform Initiative\u00a0of the Institute for Policy Studies. Those U.S. billionaires represent 13% of the total 876 billionaires in the U.S., according to the report, revealing the small portion of the wealthiest people who have publicly committed to giving away their fortunes.",
      "The report found that of the 22 billionaires who have died since taking the pledge, only one gave away his fortune before he died. Meanwhile, only eight of the 22 deceased pledgers fulfilled the commitment by giving away half of their wealth or more at their death, though some of their estates are still being resolved.",
      "Chuck Collins, one of the authors of the report and an expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, said Eilish's comments are part of a growing realization that the rules of the economy favor those with assets over those who earn wages.",
      "He thinks the Giving Pledge has created an expectation and competition for the wealthiest to give away their money, but the fortunes of many of the pledgers have increased over time, meaning they will need to move even more aggressively if they are to fulfill the commitment.",
      "\"In the end, philanthropy is not a substitute for a fair and effective tax system,\" Collins said. \"The level of extreme inequality will require some form of restoring progressivity to the tax system, a wealth tax as well as progressive income tax.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 12:24:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 08:52:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Visa predicts Americans will spend an average of $736 on holiday gifts in 2025, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to open their wallets this holiday season, increasing their gift budgets even as a slowing job market and stubborn inflation weigh on consumer confidence, according to a new analysis from Visa Business and Economic Insights.",
      "U.S. consumers are forecast to spend an average of $736 each on holiday gifts, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year, Visa said in its 2025 holiday spending outlook.",
      "Inflation partly explains this year's projected sales growth, with the Consumer Price Index showing that prices rose 3% on an annual basis in September. But Americans are also planning on upping their gifting, especially older consumers, with baby boomers forecasted to boost their holiday spending by 21%, the study found.",
      "The robust spending outlook highlights consumers' resilience, even as confidence surveys paint a more cautious picture.",
      "\"We are clearly seeing consumers spend in a far better, more robust way than what we're seeing in the consumer sentiment and confidence data,\" Michael Brown, a principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Visa tapped retail sales data from the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 excluding automobiles, gas stations and restaurants \u2014 for its holiday spending projections.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, changes in consumer spending corresponded more closely with consumer sentiment, Visa's analysis shows. But that link has weakened in recent years. In April, for example, when consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, real consumer spending increased 3.1% on an annual basis, the Visa report points out.",
      "Consumers continue to express dour views about the economy, with sentiment falling for a third consecutive month\u00a0in October due to worries about a weaker job market and rising inflation, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment index. Another measure from the Conference Board, a nonprofit group, also shows confidence in the economy edged down slightly this month.",
      "What explains the disconnect? Steady wage gains have kept spending aloft, with many Americans continuing to shop despite higher prices because their take-home pay remains solid, Brown said.",

    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist state assemblyman from Queens, will be New York City's 111th mayor.",
    "story": [
      "Zohran Mamdani will be New York City's 111th mayor, CBS News projects, capping a closely watched campaign in which the little-known state assemblyman energized voters with his focus on making America's largest city more affordable.",
      "The 34-year-old democratic socialist defeated Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent after losing a Democratic primary that he had initially entered as the clear front-runner. The mayoral race drew the attention of President Trump, who endorsed Cuomo the night before the election and threatened to withhold federal funds to New York City under a Mayor Mamdani.",
      "Mamdani's message centered around the cost of living, energizing a coalition of young and progressive voters, even as critics questioned his lack of experience and raised concerns about his stance on Israel. He pledged to freeze rents on rent-stabilized apartments and raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for a host of new services, like free buses and city-run grocery stores.",
      "When he assumes office, Mamdani will make history as the city's first Muslim mayor. At 34, he'll also be one of the city's youngest mayors, but not the youngest ever: That distinction belongs to Hugh J. Grant, who was 31 when he was elected to his first term in 1889.",
      "Click here for complete New York City election results.",
      "Mamdani promises \"relentless improvement\"",
      "Mamdani promised to bring New York City into an age of \"relentless improvement\" as he claimed victory in the mayoral race late Tuesday night.",
      "He said his win was one for the working people of New York and reiterated his campaign promises on affordability.",
      "\"Let the words we've spoken together, the dreams we've dreamt together become the agenda we deliver together,\" Mamdani said. \"New York, this power, it's yours. This city belongs to you. Thank you.\"",
      "Mamdani's background",
      "Mamdani was born in Uganda and moved to New York City when he was 7. He attended the elite Bronx High School of Science before heading off to Bowdoin College.",
      "In 2018, he became an American citizen.",
      "His parents are political science professor Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair. Mamdani is married to artist Rama Duawaji. They live in Queens, where Mamdani has served as state assemblyman since 2021, representing Astoria, Astoria Heights and Ditmars-Steinway in Queens.",
      "Mamdani's policies",
      "Mamdani focused his campaign around reducing the cost of living. He promised to freeze the rent for\u00a0the city's rent-stabilized units. He has also pledged to provide\u00a0free bus service\u00a0and to open city-owned grocery stores in each borough. Mamdani also says he wants to build 200,000 affordable housing units.",
      "To pay for his proposals, Mamdani has said he would raise taxes on corporations and on top earners by 2%, but he'll need the help of Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state legislature to do it.",
      "His candidacy was enthusiastically embraced by prominent fellow progressives like\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0and\u00a0Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He eventually got the endorsement of some top Democrats including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and\u00a0Hochul.",
      "Mamdani's position on Israel\u00a0drew scrutiny over the course of the campaign. He condemned\u00a0the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terrorist attacks\u00a0on Israel, but also criticized the Israeli government's response, calling the war in Gaza a genocide. Israel said his comments were \"shameful.\"",
      "Mamdani says, while he supports Israel's right to exist,\u00a0he will not say it should exist as a Jewish state.",
      "\"I would not recognize any state's right to exist with a system of hierarchy on the basis of race or religion,\" he said in the candidates' second and final debate.",
      "He also said critics have wrongly accused him of more extreme statements.",
      "\"I have never, not once, spoken in support of global jihad. That is not something that I have said. And that continues to be ascribed to me. And frankly, I think much of it has to do with that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election,\" Mamdani said during the last debate.",
      "Mamdani and the NYPD",
      "Mamdani came under withering criticism for his past remarks regarding the NYPD. He previously called for disbanding the Strategic Response Group, which was the same unit that responded to the Midtown office shooting in July. He has since walked that back, saying he was opposed to using that unit to respond to protests.",
      "\"I am not defunding the police,\" Mamdani said\u00a0this summer. \"I am not running to defund the police.\"",
      "In an\u00a0October interview with Fox News, Mamdani again apologized for remarks he made about the NYPD in 2020, when he called the department \"racist\" and a \"threat to public safety\" amid nationwide protests after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.",
      "\"We used to ask officers to focus on serious crimes. Now we're asking them to focus also on the mental health crisis, to focus also on homelessness,\" Mamdani said last month. \"Absolutely I'll apologize to police officers right here. Because this is the apology that I've been sharing with many rank and file officers. And I apologize because of the fact that I'm looking to work with these officers, and I know that these officers, these men and women who serve in the NYPD, they put their lives on the line every single day.\"",
      "Mamdani also recently said he would ask Jessica Tisch to stay on as police commissioner.",

    "summary": "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country that U.N. experts warn could be sliding \"back toward another deadly war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Department of Homeland Security is planning to terminate Temporary Protected Status for nationals of South Sudan imminently, CBS News has exclusively learned. The change will end more than a decade of protection that allowed thousands of displaced South Sudanese nationals to live and work legally in the United States.",
      "According to DHS officials, the decision by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem came after consultation with the State Department and other federal agencies.",
      "Despite recent warnings from the United Nations and other organizations that South Sudan could actually be slipping back into a state of open warfare, DHS officials pointed to the end of an armed conflict, improved diplomatic relations and South Sudan's expressed commitment to reintegrating any returning nationals, adding that continuing the TPS designation for South Sudan would be \"contrary\" to U.S. interests.",
      "The designation lapsed on November 3, 2025, and a DHS official tells CBS News that a formal notice of termination will be published in the Federal Register later this week, triggering a 60-day grace period for South Sudanese nationals to depart the country or face deportation once their status officially expires in January. DHS estimates that roughly 5,000 South Sudanese nationals are currently living in the United States.",
      "Over the past 14 years, under the program, South Sudanese nationals who could not safely return to their home country due to armed conflict and environmental disaster were shielded from deportation and allowed to work legally in the U.S. The designation dated back to a period of rampant instability that began when the young nation first gained its independence in 2011. Multiple presidential administrations had since extended the program.",
      "South Sudan's TPS designation was most recently renewed for 18 months, from November 4, 2023, to May 3, 2025, by then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, \"due to ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in South Sudan that prevent individuals from safely returning.\" It was then extended automatically for six months, through November 3, after DHS did not complete a required review before a statutory 60-day window passed.",
      "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country still struggling to recover from years of civil war and humanitarian crises. While DHS says conditions have improved, humanitarian groups and regional experts caution that peace remains fragile, with deepening economic distress creating challenges for any safe return.",
      "U.N. says \"all indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war\"",
      "International mediators have reported some progress toward implementing a peace agreement and transitional governance framework, despite violence, corruption and weak state institutions hampering humanitarian access. But the U.S. State Department maintains a\u00a0Level 4 \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for South Sudan, citing persistent armed conflict, crime and kidnapping.",
      "According to the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations, armed clashes among government troops, opposition forces and ethnic militias continue to claim lives and displace civilians.",
      "The United Nations has documented widespread human rights abuses, including the recruitment of child soldiers, sexual violence and arbitrary detentions, and the global body's human rights chief warned as recently as September that the fragile truce could crumble.",
      "\"With fears of a collapse of the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement and a return to widespread violence intensifying, I deeply worry for the plight of civilians in South Sudan,\" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in late September.",
      "More recently, a U.N. commission on human rights in the country warned the U.N. General Assembly at the end of October that \"South Sudan's political transition is falling apart.\"",
      "\"The ceasefire is not holding, political detentions have become a tool of repression, the peace agreement's key provisions are being systematically violated, and the Government forces are using aerial bombardments in civilian areas. All indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war,\" commissioner Barney Afako told the U.N.",
      "The U.N.'s\u00a0World Food Program\u00a0has also warned that ongoing conflict, flooding and food insecurity are worsening humanitarian conditions in the country.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the population \u2014 an estimated 9 million people \u2014 require humanitarian assistance, while 7.7 million face acute food insecurity, according to the Congressional Research Service and the\u00a0U.N. Population Fund.",
      "In the run-up to the official termination, DHS is now urging South Sudanese nationals who choose to depart voluntarily to use the Customs and Border Protection \"CBP Home\" mobile app to report their departure. The app, according to the department, offers a \"safe, secure\" way to self-deport, including a complimentary plane ticket, an exit bonus of $1,000 and potential pathways for future legal immigration to the United States, although DHS has not outlined what those pathways might look like."

      "He was a factor for many voters in each of the places where exit polls were conducted: Virginia, New Jersey, New York City and California. And more said their vote in these races was to oppose him, than support him.",
      "These are historically Democrat-leaning places, and more voters here disapproved than approved of his overall job as president. They also found that his administration's actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far.",
      "New York City: Cost of living and bringing needed change",
      "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani won a decisive victory over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on a campaign of affordability, and the cost of living was the most important issue to voters in New York City. Mamdani handily won the majority of voters who picked it. More specifically, he focused on the cost of housing, which seven in 10 voters in New York said was a major problem where they live, and he won among renters, who made up more than half of the electorate.",
      "Voters who made up their minds in the last month of the campaign voted overwhelmingly for Cuomo, but it wasn't enough to make up for the majority of voters who decided on Mamdani before October.",
      "Cuomo led Mamdani among Jewish voters \u2014 most of whom said a candidate's position on Israel was important in their vote.",
      "Mamdani's coalition was led by enormous support among voters under 30 and very liberal voters, but his support extended to all voters under 45 and to those who considered themselves only somewhat liberal, while older voters, as well as moderates and conservatives, voted for Cuomo.",
      "The Republican candidate in the New York City mayoral race, Curtis Sliwa, came in a distant third and didn't even win self-identified Republicans (they voted for Cuomo). Had he dropped out of the race, it might not have made a difference. Though most of Sliwa's supporters said they would have voted for Cuomo, exit polls indicate that in a hypothetical two-way race, Mamdani still would have been victorious.",
      "Mamdani also ran on change, and that was picked as the most important quality in how voters made their decision. A changing electorate was also a hallmark of Mamdani's win \u2014 his strongest support was not just young voters, but also those who were voting in a mayoral race for the first time and those who had moved to New York within the past 10 years.",
      "New Jersey and Virginia: The economy, women voters",
      "Economic issues also loomed large in the Democratic wins in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia. In New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli won voters who were most concerned about taxes and who said electricity was a major problem for them, but voters who said the most important issue was the economy overall voted for Sherrill. In Virginia, those \"economy\" voters voted for Abigail Spanberger over Winsome Earle-Sears by more than 20 points.",
      "Women voted in big numbers for the women Democratic candidates in Virginia and New Jersey. Sherrill and Spanberger's margins with women were far larger than Kamala Harris' were nationally in 2024.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 06:00:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court is hearing arguments over whether a federal emergency powers law authorizes President Trump's most sweeping tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to consider Wednesday whether President Trump can unilaterally impose tariffs on nearly every country under a federal emergency powers law, with the justices poised to test a centerpiece of his economic agenda and the limits of presidential powers.",
      "The court fight over Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs marks the first in which the Supreme Court will weigh the legal merits of one of the president's signature policies implemented in his second term.",
      "Three lower courts have concluded that most of the president's tariffs are illegal, and a ruling from the Supreme Court upholding those decisions would deal a blow to Mr. Trump's plans to use tariffs as leverage to push U.S. trading partners to negotiate better trade deals. The president has also claimed that tariffs help to boost domestic manufacturing.",
      "At issue in the case are two sets of duties that Mr. Trump rolled out through a series of executive orders earlier this year. The president has relied on a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose the tariffs.",
      "The first tranche set a baseline rate of 10% on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as well as higher reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries in response to what he said are \"large and persistent\" trade deficits. The second targeted China, Canada and Mexico with tariffs of varying rates for what he asserted was their failure to stop the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S.",
      "In his executive orders, the president declared trade imbalances and the trafficking of drugs across U.S. borders as national emergencies, which unlocked IEEPA's powers. The law authorizes the president to \"regulate \u2026 importation\" to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security, foreign policy or the U.S. economy. Mr. Trump has argued that trade deficits and the failure to curtail the flow of illicit drugs into the country qualify as such a threat.",
      "Presidents have used IEEPA dozens of times over the past nearly 50 years to impose sanctions on foreign actors, but it has never before been used to levy tariffs.",
      "Since Mr. Trump announced the import taxes in February and April \u2014 on what he called \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 the administration has reached trade deals with at least 10 countries and the European Union, and said it is \"actively negotiating\" with other nations.",
      "But after the rollout of the new levies, two sets of small businesses and a group of 12 states filed lawsuits arguing that IEEPA doesn't authorize the president's sweeping action. The first case was brought in Washington, D.C., by a pair of Illinois-based educational toy companies. The others, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, came from a group of five small businesses and Democratic officials from 12 states.",
      "The U.S. district court in Washington and the Court of International Trade separately ruled against the administration, concluding that IEEPA doesn't give the president the authority to impose his global and trafficking-related tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the trade court's decision in cases from the five small businesses and states, ruled 7-4 that many of the president's levies are illegal. The appeals court found that while IEEPA may authorize some tariffs, the law didn't allow for those \"of the magnitude\" of Mr. Trump's.",
      "Still, it allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the sweeping tariffs while the legal battles play out.",
      "Mr. Trump has also continued to rely on IEEPA to impose new levies or tweak existing rates, including raising Canadian tariffs to 35% (though many of its goods are subject to exemptions),\u00a0imposing an additional 40% duty on Brazil and threatening China with an additional 100% duty, though the president has since walked that back. Mr. Trump announced last week following a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would be\u00a0reducing the tariffs on goods imported from China.",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs on an extremely fast timeline, having agreed in September to decide the cases, and could move quickly to issue a ruling.",
      "Trump administration argues for presidential powers",
      "In urging the high court to uphold the duties, the Trump administration has argued that Congress has long given the president broad authority to impose tariffs to address emergencies. IEEPA, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing, is a continuation of that tradition because it gives the president the power to \"regulate \u2026 importation.\"",
      "Sauer also said that the tariffs are an exercise of Mr. Trump's power over national security and foreign affairs, and courts should give deference to his determination that the duties are best suited for addressing national emergencies arising from trade deficits and drug-trafficking.",
      "Invalidating those levies, Sauer wrote, would have \"catastrophic consequences\" for national security, foreign policy and the economy.",
      "\"To the President, these cases present a stark choice: With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump is highly invested in the case, calling it \"one of the most important in the history of the country.\" The president floated attending the arguments in person, but he reversed course Sunday, writing on social media that he did \"not want to distract from the importance of this decision.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u00a0told Fox News on Monday that he will be at the arguments with a \"ringside seat.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Bessent is attending at the president's request.",
      "Businesses warn of economic impact",
      "On the other side, the small businesses warned in court papers that Mr. Trump's tariffs have significant economic consequences. An analysis from the Tax Foundation found the duties will impose $1.7 trillion in new taxes on Americans by 2035, reduce GDP growth by 0.7% per year, and reduce income by 1.1% in 2026.",
      "Neal Katyal, who will argue on behalf of the companies before the Supreme Court, said the Trump administration's interpretation of IEEPA is a \"breathtaking assertion\" of power that requires explicit authorization from Congress. IEEPA, he said, doesn't even mention the word tariff or duty, and no president has understood the law to authorize them.",
      "If the Supreme Court agrees with Mr. Trump that the power to tax is found in IEEPA through the phrase \"regulate \u2026 importation,\" then \"the president, empowered by a supercharged U.S. Code, could tax everything from autos to zoos,\" Katyal wrote in a filing.",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that trade deficits hardly constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat,\" as imbalances have lasted for five decades, and Mr. Trump himself has described them as \"persistent.\"",
      "Additionally, the power to levy taxes and duties rests squarely with Congress, and any delegations of that power have been \"explicit and strictly limited,\" they said. And indeed, there are numerous other statutes in which Congress has delegated its tariffing power \u2014 some of which have been used by Mr. Trump \u2014 though they put constraints on the president.",
      "Testing the boundaries of presidential authority",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's efforts to use IEEPA to impose his sweeping tariffs comes as he has tested the boundaries of his presidential authority, including through his firings of independent agency officials, the withholding of $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress and his efforts to overhaul the executive branch.",
      "Those cases have already been before the Supreme Court, though at earlier stages than the challenges to Mr. Trump's tariffs. In most of those emergency appeals, the conservative justices have allowed the Trump administration to temporarily enforce its policies while proceedings in the lower courts continue.",
      "Like those other cases, the dispute over whether Mr. Trump has the authority to impose duties on nearly every country under IEEPA without Congress could have significant implications for presidential power.",
      "The Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad assertions of executive authority on issues of major political and economic significance when Congress has not spoken clearly, invoking what's called the major questions doctrine to invalidate former President Joe Biden's plan to wipe away more than $400 billion in student loan debt and block an eviction moratorium during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "That legal principle is raised in the battle over his tariffs, though the Trump administration argues that it doesn't apply to matters of national security and foreign policy.",
      "\"Judges lack the institutional competence to determine when foreign affairs pose an unusual and extraordinary threat that requires an emergency response; that is a task for the political Branches,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "But lawyers for the small businesses counter that tariffs are a tax on the American people, and the Constitution has vested the taxing power in Congress.",
      "\"The Framers understood that taxation is a potent power that can destroy the taxed as it fills the sovereign's coffers. The Constitution vests that extraordinary power exclusively in the branch of government considered most responsive to the citizenry: Congress,\" lawyers for the Illinois companies wrote in a filing. \"This Court should not lightly assume that Congress abdicated its core taxing power to permit the President to tax Americans with virtually no limits.\"",

    "summary": "California voters have passed Proposition 50, CBS News projects, approving a measure that will redraw the state's congressional districts.",
    "story": [
      "California voters have passed Proposition 50, CBS News projects, approving a measure backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats that\u00a0will redraw the state's congressional districts.",
      "The measure is intended to make several Republican-held congressional districts in California more favorable to Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections in an effort to counter recent redistricting in states including Texas that favors Republicans.",
      "\"It was not just a victory tonight for the Democratic Party. It was a victory for the United States of America, for the people of this country, the principles that our Founding Fathers lived and died for,\" Newsom said in a press conference after the measure passed. \"We're proud here in California to be a part of this narrative.\"",
      "Proposition 50's passage drew swift reaction from high-profile opponents of the measure, including Republican political donor Charles Munger, Jr.",
      "\"For what looms for the people of California, I am saddened by the passage of Proposition 50,\" Munger Jr. said. \"But I am content in this, at least: that our campaign educated the people of California so they could make an informed, if in my view unwise, decision about such a technical but critical issue as redistricting reform, a decision forced to be made over such a very short time.\"",
      "Proposition 50 was approved by the Legislature and\u00a0signed by Newsom\u00a0on Aug. 21, allowing it to go before voters for a Nov. 4 special election.",
      "Here's what to know about Proposition 50 and California's special election.",
      "California Proposition 50 live election results",
      "It could take several days to count all mail-in ballots, as California accepts ballots postmarked by Election Day and received within seven days.",
      "Reactions to Proposition 50 passing",
      "Reactions from both sides quickly came pouring in once California voters passed Proposition 50.",
      "Billionaire investor Tom Steyer has been a major supporter of the measure and called its approval \"an enormous victory for our state, our country and our democracy.\"",
      "\"In fact, voters all across the country tonight sent a clear signal tonight that when Democrats fight for working people and their interests, Democrats win,\" Steyer said in a statement.",
      "Republican Congressman Kevin Kiley, whose District 3 will be heavily impacted by the redrawn district boundaries, called the measure \"a symptom of our country's political divisions.\"",
      "\"The reason I opposed Prop. 50, even as I also oppose what's happened in other states, is because I believe fighting fire with fire burns everything down,\" Kiley said. \"With California's new gerrymander, the redistricting arms race has no end in sight\u2026 It's a race to the bottom that degrades democracy everywhere.\"",
      "Republican Congressman Doug LaMalfa, whose District 1 will also be heavily impacted by the new maps, said opponents of the measure expect to take legal action as early as this week.",
      "\"Should these results stick, the imbalance in California between rural and urban voices will get that much worse, essentially silencing our portion of the state,\" Lamalfa said. Those of us who support fair maps will continue to oppose Newsom's scheme, and we expect to file suit on Wednesday. I hope and expect the courts will see this for what it is-blatantly corrupt and unconstitutional.\"",
      "Jessica Millan Patterson, chair of the No on Prop 50 Stop Sacramento's Power Grab campaign, expressed disappointment in the decision.",
      "\"In the end, the tens of millions poured in to promote these gerrymandered maps were too much to overcome, as Newsom put his national ambitions ahead of protecting California's voter-approved independent redistricting commission and the millions of voices now silenced,\" Patterson said. \"Though this isn't the outcome we hoped for, we're proud to have stood for fair maps and honest representation for all Californians.\"",
      "Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, called the passage of Proposition 50 \"a testament to the leadership of Governor Newsom and Democrats across California who refused to back down\" to the Trump administration and the Republican Party.",
      "\"When we fight, we win, and from Day One, the DNC has been proud to stand right there alongside Californians to defend democracy and deliver a message that echoes nationwide,\" Martin said.",
      "Newsom also called on other states to follow California's lead and recognize \"what's at stake.\"",
      "\"We all must contribute a verse,\" Newsom said. \"And so we need the state of Virginia, we need the state of Maryland, we need our friends in New York and Illinois and Colorado, we need to see other states, their remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things to meet this moment head on as well, to recognize what we're up against in 2026.\"",
      "What is Proposition 50?",
      "Proposition 50 will replace California's current congressional district maps that were drawn by the independent\u00a0California Citizens Redistricting Commission\u00a0after the 2020 U.S. Census. New maps, crafted by the state Legislature, redraw the state's congressional districts to make five Republican-held U.S. House seats in California more favorable for Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "California Democrats have called Proposition 50 a countermeasure to Texas' recent redistricting\u00a0push that was backed by President Trump and created five Republican-friendly congressional seats in that state.",
      "California voters approved the creation of the independent redistricting commission earlier this century to oversee the congressional mapmaking process. The commission uses census data and public input to set district boundaries that reflect population changes and keep communities together.",
      "If voters had rejected Proposition 50, California would have continued using its current congressional district boundaries until new maps are drawn by the redistricting commission after the 2030 Census.",
      "Who urged voters to vote yes on Proposition 50?",
      "Gov. Newsom and top Democratic leaders, including many who are trying to succeed him in California's 2026 gubernatorial race, have championed Proposition 50.",
      "Other major supporters of Proposition 50 include billionaire investors George Soros and Steyer, and former President Barack Obama, who featured in a Yes on 50 campaign ad, calling on voters to approve the ballot measure.",
      "Supporters argue that Proposition 50 defends democracy and restores fairness after redistricting efforts in GOP-led states like Texas.",
      "Who urged voters to vote no on Proposition 50?",
      "Former Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has criticized the redistricting effort, saying the initiative \"doesn't make sense.\" Schwarzenegger has also appeared in ads that oppose Proposition 50.",
      "Others who oppose the initiative include Munger, Jr., who contributed more than $32.7 million, and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.",
      "Opponents argue that Proposition 50 is gerrymandering and that California should maintain its standard for fair redistricting through independent, citizen-led redistricting.",
      "How Proposition 50 got on the ballot",
      "Proposition 50 was placed on the ballot by the California Legislature earlier this year.",
      "Lawmakers approved the measure during a special session in August, and Newsom's signature set the stage for this statewide special election.",
      "Which California districts would change with Proposition 50?",
      "Among California's 52 congressional districts, Democrats represent 43 while Republicans represent nine.",
      "Proposition 50 was created to redraw congressional districts to make five of them currently held by GOP House members  more favorable to being won by Democrats in next year's midterms. Still, there is no guarantee that Democrats will win the seats even though voters have approved the new maps.",
      "The five Republican-led congressional districts most targeted under Proposition 50 are Rep. LaMalfa's District 1, Rep. Kiley's District 3, Rep. David Valadao's District 22, Rep. Ken Calvert's District 41, and Rep. Darrell Issa's District 48.",

Cuomo, the son of liberal icon and former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, was endorsed by the current scandal-ridden New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped his reelection bid, and President Trump.",
      "In the 2024 primary elections, \"mainstream\" Democrats outperformed progressive candidates, winning about two-thirds of the races, according to a study from the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. The study also noted just three House candidates and one Senate candidate who identify as democratic socialists won their elections in 2024.",
      "A CBS News poll conducted last week found that just 22% of Democrats nationwide think the party should move toward socialist positions. A majority \u2014 60% of Democrats nationwide \u2014 said their party's economic positions should reflect a mixture of socialist and capitalist ideas. And 5% said the party should move more toward capitalist positions.",
      "Establishment Democratic leaders have mostly offered tepid endorsements of Mamdani, or none at all, and moderate Democrats have been trying to distance themselves from his proposals.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, was slow to endorse Mamdani, offering his backing to the candidate in late October, only a day before early voting began. Neither of the state's Democratic senators, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, gave their endorsement. Former President Barack Obama called Mamdani the weekend before the election, but he stopped short of offering public support.",
      "Jeffries told CNN in an interview Sunday that he does not view Mamdani as the future of the party and is not concerned about Republicans using him as a \"lightning rod\" against Democrats in the elections next November.",
      "That won't stop Republicans from asserting that Mamdani is the new face of the Democratic Party. They're doing it already. The National Republican Campaign Committee, the House GOP's fundraising arm, has been linking Mamdani to vulnerable Democrats in New York, as well as party leaders.",
      "\"The Democrat Party has surrendered to radical socialist Zohran Mamdani and the far-left mob who are now running the show,\" NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement Tuesday. \"Every House Democrat is foolishly complicit in their party's collapse, and voters will make them pay in 2026.\"",
      "Bennett said Mamdani's win and the Democratic Socialists of America platform gives Republicans \"a pretty potent set of weapons\" to use against Democrats running in Republican strongholds and battleground states or districts. He compared it to Republican attack ads against Democrats during the \"defund the police\" movement which gained prominence after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police.",
      "\"It raises the level of difficulty to flip places from red to blue,\" Bennett said. \"What we have learned, and we especially learned from the 'defund the police' experience, is that silence is deadly. So Democrats cannot simply presume that their reputation, their brand, the fact that they are local in Wisconsin or Michigan or wherever they're running is going to be enough to convince people that they don't share the Mamdani ideas the Republicans suggest that they do.\"",
      "Also unclear: Whether New York Democrats will help or hinder Mamdani as he tries to implement his far-reaching agenda. He'll need authorization from New York state agencies for proposals like free bus service, and Democrats in Albany will need to greenlight some of the tax increases on high earners that he's proposed in order to pay for his plans.",
      "\"While there is some low-hanging fruit, we believe that many initiatives are not viable in their current form,\" J.P. Morgan Asset Management said in a report on Mamdani's platform last month that argued state lawmakers are unlikely to let him hike taxes on corporations and residents who make over $1 million.",
      "Still, Bennett said there are lessons that Democratic candidates can learn from Mamdani, the most important being his \"crystal clear\" focus on affordability.",
      "\"I don't particularly like his ideas, but he articulated them in ways that really resonated and that people could kind of repeat back to him, and that's a very good lesson for Democrats to take,\" he said.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who also describes himself as a democratic socialist, told CBS News' \"The Takeout\": \"If he wins, the message goes all over this country: You can stand up to the oligarchs, we can start electing members of Congress and mayors and governors who stand with the working class.\"",

      "In September, a branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records to a Ciattarelli ally. The documents contained personal details, including Sherrill's social security number.",
      "Later, Ciattarelli threatened to sue Sherrill over claims she made in their second debate about his former business.",
      "Polls in the run-up to the election showed the race between Sherrill and Ciattarelli was tightening. Experts said voter turnout and enthusiasm would be crucial in this off-year election.",
      "Affordability was a key issue for both candidates, and Sherrill said she plans to address high property taxes in the state.",
      "\"It's really breaking the back of too many families. So while this has been a high-cost state, and I've always been working hard to get rid of the state and local tax deduction cap, I will increase that first-time home buyers' program so people can get a foot in the door,\" Sherrill said.",

      "California's approval of Proposition 50 sets in motion a redistricting plan that could result in pickups of five seats for Democrats in the Golden State. It's an effort that may ripple beyond California's borders \u2014 here's an early look at some of Prop 50's potential effects, not all of which are related to redistricting:",
      "A win for Democrats",
      "Prop 50 victory, among other things, notches a badly needed win for Democrats in the redistricting battle kicked off by President Trump earlier this year.",
      "The president, seeking to gain up to five seats for Republicans to try to help them hold the House in the 2026 midterm elections, successfully urged Texas to undertake a mid-decade gerrymander. Newsom said he'd only go through with Prop 50 if Texas passed its new congressional map. In announcing the initiative, Newsom said Mr. Trump is \"trying to rig the system,\" adding \"we have got to meet fire with fire.\"",
      "New lines would be temporary",
      "The passage of the ballot measure, pending legal action, will result in a map drawn by California Democrats that takes five Republican congressional districts and makes them more favorable to Democrats. But it would only be used for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.",
      "After the 2030 U.S. Census, according to Prop 50, the gerrymandered maps would only be used until the nonpartisan California Citizens Redistricting Commission draws new congressional maps.",
      "Newer maps that squeeze majority's opponents across the country",
      "More and more states have begun trying to squeeze partisan minorities further through redistricting before next year's midterms. A CBS News poll in October found that among voters who plan to support Proposition 50, one reason they're doing so is to oppose the Trump administration \u2014 which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states \u2014 and to oppose national Republicans.",
      "California's decision to redraw its maps has already begun to exert pressure on more GOP-led states to launch their own redistricting gambits. Besides Texas, lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina have passed new maps in recent months that shift one district apiece toward Republicans, and Ohio is considering new maps.",
      "Republicans in Indiana signaled last month that they didn't have the votes to redraw their maps, but after weeks of pressure from Mr. Trump, GOP Gov. Mike Braun called the legislature into a special session to consider redistricting.",
      "And in Maryland, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore has just announced the creation of a redistricting commission to consider mid-decade redistricting.",
      "\"We will explore every avenue possible to make sure Maryland has fair and representative maps,\" Moore said in a statement. But Maryland state Senate president Bill Ferguson, also a Democrat, believes mid-cycle redistricting in Maryland \"is the wrong path for our State,\" he said on X. He warned of legal barriers to redistricting that could result in ceding \"one or two congressional seats to Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"There's fighting fire with fire, and then there's unintentionally burning your own house down in the process,\" Ferguson said.",
      "Platform for Newsom's political future?",
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become one of Mr. Trump's highest-profile adversaries, was the architect of California's mid-decade redistricting effort and fought for the Prop 50 initiative. His push for Prop 50 may for a time have been the most public example of resistance by Democrats against Mr. Trump.",
      "Newsom has not ruled out a run for the presidency in 2028, and his success in selling Prop 50 to voters could help launch a campaign, especially if Democrats are able to take the House in 2026. And he indicated to Robert Costa in a late October interview on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" that he'll give serious thought to running after the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Voters in Tuesday's race were divided on whether Newsom should run for president in 2028, with 45% saying he should and 54% saying he shouldn't, according to exit polling data.",
      "The results of Prop 50 tracked closely with voters' views on Newsom's future: Some 94% of Californians who support a Newsom presidential run voted yes on Prop 50, while 65% of those who don't want him to run voted no.",

      "Jones defeated GOP incumbent Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, who had tried to seize on the resurfaced text messages to portray him as unfit for the office. But Miyares, who was backed by President Trump, was confronted by the headwinds of the federal shutdown and the president's government cuts in a state with high numbers of government workers \u2014 over 147,000 \u2014 according to Office of Personnel Management data.",
      "In his sole debate against Miyares, Jones apologized multiple times for the texts, but maintained Miyares' connections to Mr. Trump were worse.",
      "Jones resisted calls from Republicans to drop out after the text message scandal.",
      "Although Jones was denounced by the Democrats' nominee for governor, Abigail Spanberger, who also won on Tuesday night, over the text messages, he was part of the Democrats' closing rally over the weekend with former President Barack Obama.",
      "In the text messages, Jones wrote that he would \"piss on graves\" of GOP opponents and mused about a fantasy hypothetical shooting of Republican Todd Gilbert, who was then speaker of the House of Delegates.

      "Democrats are set to sweep Tuesday's gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, as the national party \u2014 still facing internal battles about its future \u2014 seeks to recover from last year's losses to President Trump.",
      "Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill is projected to defeat Republican former legislator Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey, and Democratic former Rep. Abigail Spanberger is projected to overcome Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia.",
      "The results mark a turnaround for Democrats in two states where the party has faced setbacks in recent years \u2014 especially during last year's presidential race, when Mr. Trump significantly boosted his share of the vote in normally blue-leaning New Jersey and Virginia, and the 2021 races, when Republicans reversed years of Democratic gains at the governor's mansion.",
      "The races could also serve as an early rebuke to Mr. Trump, albeit in two states that have never backed him outright. Spanberger and Sherrill ran hard against the president, who is unpopular in their respective states.",
      "And both Democratic campaigns \u2014 along with those of their GOP opponents \u2014 focused on economic concerns,\u00a0 an issue both parties have struggled with. Nationwide, most voters disapprove of the president's handling of the economy and worry that inflation will increase, though only 28% think Democrats have a better approach to economic policy than Mr. Trump and the GOP, according to a CBS News poll from last week.",
      "Still unresolved, however, is a longstanding internal dispute over whether the Democratic Party should embrace a progressive platform or move in a more moderate direction. Sherrill and Spanberger hail from the party's moderate wing. But on the same night as their victories, the New York City mayoral race is leaning toward Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who campaigned on rent freezes and city-owned grocery stores.",
      "Sherrill wins in New Jersey after Trump showed strength last year",
      "The victory by Sherrill, a four-term House member and former Navy pilot, follows two unexpectedly close races for New Jersey Democrats.",
      "One year ago, the state faced its tightest presidential contest since 1992. Mr. Trump lost the Garden State by just 5.9 percentage points in 2024, compared to 15.8-point and 14.1-point losses in prior times Mr. Trump was on the ballot.",
      "And in 2021, incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy defeated Ciattarelli by just 3 points, after Murphy won with a more than 14-point edge in 2017.",
      "While New Jersey hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988, the governor's office has darted between the two parties for decades. This year marks the first time since the 1960s when a single party has won three New Jersey gubernatorial races in a row.",
      "Both candidates spoke extensively about the cost of living, with Ciattarelli promising to \"Make New Jersey Affordable Again\" and Sherrill touting an \"Affordability Agenda.\"",
      "Sherrill frequently sought to link Ciattarelli to Mr. Trump and argued he would not stand up to the president, who enthusiastically endorsed the former state legislator, while Ciattarelli accused Democratic politicians like Murphy of mismanaging the state.",
      "Both Murphy and Mr. Trump are unpopular in New Jersey, with the governor's favorability (45%) fairly similar to the president's (44%), according to exit poll data.",
      "The race grew increasingly bitter in its closing weeks, with both campaigns tossing legal threats. CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records \u2014 including her Social Security number \u2014 to a Ciattarelli ally. And Ciattarelli threatened to sue Sherrill for defamation after she attacked him for alleged links to the opioid industry and claimed he \"went on to kill tens of thousands of people.\"",

      "Spanberger, a former House member and CIA officer, also tried to tie her opponent to Mr. Trump and railed against the administration's cuts to the federal workforce \u2014 a potent line of attack in Virginia, which has about 150,000 federal government jobs.",
      "Unlike in the New Jersey race, Mr. Trump did not endorse Earle-Sears for governor outright, although he appeared a telerally on Monday for the Republican ticket and he has penned Truth Social posts generically encouraging people to vote for the Republican candidates in Virginia.",
      "\"YOU WILL RUE THE DAY THAT YOU VOTED TO DESTROY YOUR LIFE,\" he wrote in a message Monday warning voters not to back Democrats.",
      "The state's gubernatorial races almost always go to the party that doesn't control the White House, and are often treated as referenda on the president. Mr. Trump's approval rating in Virginia stands at 42%, with 55% disapproving, according to exit poll data.",
      "Virginia used to be reliably red at the national level but has shifted leftward in recent years, backing Democrats in every presidential race since 2008 after voting for Republicans in the nine races before that. Democrats faced some slippage last year: Mr. Trump lost in the state by 5.7 points last year, compared to a 10.1-point loss in 2020.",
      "Spanberger sought to brand herself as a moderate, campaigning for part of the closing stretch with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a fellow moderate, and touting endorsements from two former Republican lawmakers.",
      "Meanwhile, Earle-Sears tried to follow Gov. Glenn Youngkin's strategy in 2021 and capitalize on some of the more polarizing parts of the Democratic agenda, attacking Spanberger on immigration enforcement and transgender issues. \"Spanberger is for they/them, not us,\" said one Earle-Sears ad that closely mirrored one of last year's best-known pro-Trump advertisements.",
      "Earle-Sears also railed against Spanberger over Democratic Attorney General candidate Jay Jones, who sent violent and incendiary texts about Virginia Republicans.",

      "Dating back to early September, the Trump administration has reported well over a dozen such strikes in the waters of the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean off South America on what it alleges are drug vessels. The strikes have killed more than 50 people.",
      "Outside of the unclassified videos released by the Defense Department, the U.S. has provided no details on the boats that were struck or about the people aboard.",
      "The White House says they are part of an effort to cripple the operations of drug cartels. Some lawmakers have criticized the strikes, saying the White House has not provided enough evidence the boats were smuggling drugs, and with some insisting the president needs congressional approval to carry out the strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump on Oct. 23 told reporters, \"Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead.\"",
      "Several of the strikes have occurred off the coast of Venezuela, as Mr. Trump has been vocal in his criticism of controversial Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0and amid a broader buildup of U.S. military assets in the Caribbean.",

      "National politics were a throughline in this year's race, especially the Trump administration's sweeping federal layoffs and the still-unresolved month-long government shutdown, which has forced most federal workers to go without pay. Both issues are potent in Virginia, which has nearly 150,000 federal civilian jobs and is home to scores of military personnel.",
      "Spanberger, a former CIA officer and congresswoman, positioned herself as an adversary of the Trump administration and sought to link Earle-Sears to Mr. Trump. She frequently tried to capitalize on frustration over federal layoffs and Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Virginia has moved leftward in recent years, driven by shifts in the fast-growing suburbs of Washington, D.C., though Democrats lost ground last year, with Mr. Trump boosting his share of the statewide vote from 44% in 2020 to 46.1% in 2024.",
      "A year later, however, the president's approval rating in Virginia stands at 42%, with 55% disapproving, according to exit poll data \u2014 a possible liability for Republicans.",
      "But the race also follows months of uncertainty for the Democratic Party, which was stung by its 2024 loss and is still riven by disagreements between its moderate and progressive factions on the party's strategy moving forward. Meanwhile, just 34% of U.S. adults hold a favorable view of the party, compared to 41% for the GOP, according to a CBS News poll from last month.",
      "Earle-Sears, a Marine Corps veteran and former state lawmaker, took aim at Spanberger over immigration and the participation of transgender students in school sports.",
      "In recent weeks, the race has been dominated by a scandal in the usually lower-profile Virginia attorney general election, after text messages surfaced showing Democratic nominee Jay Jones used violent and incendiary language toward Republicans. Spanberger condemned the messages, but Earle-Sears pressed her to call for Jones to drop out of the race.",
      "Spanberger campaigned in the closing stretch with high-profile Democrats like former President Barack Obama, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.",
      "Earle-Sears drew on support from Virginia's popular but term-limited incumbent Gov. Glenn Youngkin, whose economic record Earle-Sears has touted.",
      "But the Republican candidate wasn't explicitly endorsed by Mr. Trump, the leader of her party, even though the president gave his \"complete and total endorsement\" to the GOP nominees in Virginia's attorney general race and New Jersey's gubernatorial race.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down\u00a0on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding. Some 35 days later, it surpassed the record for longest shutdown on record.",
      "Republicans have rejected Democrats' push to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018 and early 2019, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

Democrats kept their cuts to foreign aid and defense.",

      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this.

    "summary": "President Donald Trump is nominating Jared Isaacman to serve as his NASA administrator after all.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has decided once again to nominate Jared Isaacman to serve as his NASA administrator, he announced Tuesday evening, months after withdrawing the tech billionaire and private astronaut's nomination because of concerns about his political leanings.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Isaacman to the Senate-confirmed post last year, but announced in late May he had decided to withdraw Isaacman after a \"thorough review\" of his \"prior associations.\"",
      "Weeks after the withdrawal, the president went further in expressing his concerns about Isaacman's credentials. At the time, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he thought Isaacman \"was very good,\" but had been \"surprised to learn\" that Isaacman was a \"blue-blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.\"",
      "Federal Election Commission records\u00a0show\u00a0Isaacman has donated to Democratic congressional candidates and Democratic aligned groups, though he has also given some money to Republicans. Isaacman has\u00a0described himself\u00a0as \"relatively apolitical\" and a \"right-leaning moderate,\" and said he disclosed his political donations to Democrats prior to his nomination.",
      "Isaacman has had the endorsement of a powerful fellow tech entrepreneur, Mr. Trump's former adviser, Elon Musk. Isaacman, the CEO and founder of credit card-processing company Shift4, has been a close collaborator with Musk ever since buying his first chartered flight with Musk's company SpaceX. He bought a series of spaceflights from SpaceX, which has extensive contracts with NASA to transport astronauts and equipment.",
      "The president and Musk had a very public falling-out earlier this year, but are now on better terms. Last week, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Musk have spoken \"on and off\" since sitting together at conservative activist Charlie Kirk's funeral last month in Arizona and that their relationship is \"good.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested that he withdrew Isaacman's nomination in part because of his relationship with Musk, saying he \"thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life.\"",
      "Isaacman said on X he \"only know[s] Elon professionally\" and does not own any equity in SpaceX, but he has a \"firsthand appreciation for what he and his companies have accomplished.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made no mention of his previous decision to nominate and then withdraw Isaacman in his Tuesday evening announcement of the re-nomination on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\"This evening, I am pleased to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of NASA,\" Trump posted. \"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman thanked the president and the \"space-loving community\" Tuesday in a post on X, writing: \"I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been serving as interim NASA administrator. The president on Tuesday praised Duffy for doing an \"incredible job.\"",
      "The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved Isaacman's nomination in late April and a vote by the full Senate had been expected when Mr. Trump announced he was yanking the nomination.",

    "summary": "Former Vice President Dick Cheney, one of the most powerful people to hold the office, has died, his family says. He was 84.",
    "story": [
      "Former Vice President Dick Cheney, a force in Republican politics for over 30 years and one of the most powerful people to hold the second-highest office in the U.S., has died. He was 84.",
      "In\u00a0a statement, Cheney's family said he died Monday night of complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, surrounded by his wife of 61 years, Lynne, daughters Liz and Mary and other family members.",
      "Before becoming vice president in the George W. Bush administration, Cheney served as defense secretary, White House chief of staff and a Wyoming congressman.",
      "In the statement, his family called Cheney \"a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing. We are grateful beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.\"",
      "In 2000, Cheney was asked by Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, to help pick his running mate. In the end, it was Cheney's own name that topped the list. He would, it was believed, provide gravitas and broad Washington experience for the younger Texas governor.",
      "\"He really wanted me to come on board because he thought I could help govern, be part of his team, and that he wanted me involved in everything,\" Cheney told CBS' \"60 Minutes II.\"",
      "He was viewed as one of the most powerful vice presidents in U.S. history; at the same time, he became a lightning rod for those who opposed the war in Iraq and the expansion of presidential powers.",
      "\"Cheney really drastically changed the presidency, the vice president's role and our standing in the international community,\" presidential historian Alexis Coe told CBS News.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Bush called Cheney a \"calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges.\"",
      "\"I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best,\" Bush said. \"He held to his convictions and prioritized the freedom and security of the American people. For those two terms in office, and throughout his remarkable career, Dick Cheney's service always reflected credit on the country he loved.\"",
      "In recent years, Cheney saw his daughter Liz Cheney achieve political prominence as a Wyoming GOP representative in Congress known for her open criticism of President Trump. She lost her position as the top Republican woman in the House over her fight with Mr. Trump about his baseless claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from him. She went on to serve as vice chair of the House select committee investigating the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and continued to warn of the danger that she said Mr. Trump posed to democracy, even campaigning for his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, in 2024.",
      "Dick Cheney cut an ad for his daughter's failed 2022 reelection campaign backing her position, arguing that in U.S. history \"there has never been an individual that was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.\"",
      "Cheney shaped Republican Party politics for a generation, but he cast his final presidential ballot in 2024 for a Democrat. In a statement, he said Mr. Trump \"can never be trusted with power again. As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution.\"",
      "Early life and rise to power",
      "Richard Bruce Cheney was born in 1941 in Lincoln, Nebraska, and grew up in Wyoming. He attended Yale but dropped out after two years and instead finished his college education at the University of Wyoming. Cheney married his high-school sweetheart Lynne, with whom he had two daughters.",
      "He then moved to Washington, D.C., to begin his career, having avoided the draft and the Vietnam War with deferments beginning in early 1966 because it took him six years to finish college, he later testified before Congress at a confirmation hearing.",
      "By age 34, he was White House chief of staff for President Gerald Ford, the youngest person ever to hold the job.",
      "In 1978, he ran for Congress and won the first of six terms in the House, representing Wyoming. In 1989, he was chosen to be secretary of defense in the administration of President George H.W. Bush.",
      "In 1991, he oversaw the U.S. victory in the first Gulf War, when Iraqi forces were driven out of Kuwait. For years afterward, he defended the decision not to invade Baghdad.",
      "\"If we had gone on to Baghdad, if we had sort of accepted the responsibility for occupying the country, governing Iraq, putting a new government in place, running Saddam to ground, I think there would have been significant additional U.S. casualties,\" Cheney said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" in 1992. \"I can't say how many, but the proposition is how many additional American lives is Saddam Hussein worth? And my answer to that question is, not very darn many.\"",
      "In 1995, Cheney became chairman and CEO of Halliburton, the world's largest oil field services company, his first corporate job. His salary and stock options made him a multimillionaire. But in 2000 he left the company to join the Republican ticket.",
      "\"This election is about real choices \u2014 we are talking about the future of our nation,\" Cheney said at a 2000 post-debate rally in Kentucky.",
      "The presidential campaign was bitterly contested and its outcome was undecided on election night, with Florida too close to call, though Bush had a slight lead. Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, asked for recounts in four counties, as Bush sued to stop the recounts. The race was ultimately decided five weeks after the election by a 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court.",
      "A turning point in history",
      "The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States proved to be the defining moment for the new administration \u2014 particularly, it seemed, for Cheney. Even as the U.S. struck al Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan, Cheney warned of a larger web of U.S. enemies, urging military action against Iraq and Saddam Hussein.",
      "\"Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction,\" Cheney told the Veterans of Foreign Wars in 2002.",
      "Baghdad fell only three weeks after the U.S. invasion in 2003. No weapons of mass destruction were ever found, and American forces began a long, deadly occupation.",
      "\"It's hard to explain how important he was, actually, during those Iraq war days,\" Republican strategist Kevin Sheridan told CBS News. \"He was truly central to everything that America did to respond to 9/11. He's obviously received a lot of criticism since for it.\"",
      "Even so, the Bush-Cheney team made national security the centerpiece of the 2004 presidential campaign.",
      "\"If we make the wrong choice, the danger is that we'll get hit again,\" Cheney said at a town hall meeting in Des Moines, Iowa.",
      "The president and Cheney were returned to office in a close election.",
      "But as the situation in Iraq disintegrated and U.S. casualties mounted, public opinion turned against the conflict and the administration.",
      "In November 2006, Democrats won majorities in both houses of Congress, swept in primarily by anti-war sentiment.",
      "To his many detractors, Cheney was a man obsessed with secrecy, the threat of terrorism and strengthening presidential power.",
      "Cheney and Bush ignored the critics.",
      "But in his second term, the president broke with Cheney on the firing of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the offer of talks to North Korea, and the refusal of a pardon for Cheney's former chief of staff, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby. Libby was convicted in 2007 of lying to a grand jury but ultimately pardoned by President Trump in 2018.",
      "At the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama, Cheney appeared in a wheelchair because of a back injury. But the former vice president proved to be as pugnacious as ever in frequent attacks on the new president and his administration. \"I think Barack Obama is a one-term president,\" Cheney said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2010.",
      "Heart transplant brings \"a new day\"",
      "Cheney's cardiovascular health was a problem throughout his life. He suffered a total of five heart attacks, his first at age 37 during his run for Congress.",
      "In 2010, after his fifth, doctors implanted a battery-powered device to help his heart pump blood throughout his body. That bought Cheney time while he awaited a heart transplant, which he received in 2012.",
      "\"You wake up every morning with a smile on your face,\" he told 60 Minutes\u00a0in 2013, \"because you've got a new day you never expected to have.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the agency may need to close \"certain parts\" of the nation's airspace if the shutdown drags on.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation may need to close \"certain parts of the airspace\" if the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on record continues into next week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" Duffy said at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",
      "He added, \"We will restrict the airspace when we feel it's not safe.\"",
      "Throughout the 35-day federal shutdown, set to become the longest in U.S. history, Duffy has maintained that commercial air travel remains safe. The tradeoff is that passengers are experiencing more flight delays as officials slow flight traffic based on staffing levels to ensure that the national airspace remains well-monitored, Duffy\u00a0has said at earlier press conferences.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while an additional 4,700 trips were delayed on Monday, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "Duffy said on social media on Wednesday that 46% of the previous day's flight delays were due to staffing issues in air traffic control towers. Ordinarily, personnel issues account for roughly 5% of such delays, according to aviation data.",
      "\"Draconian steps\"?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights following the\u00a09/11 terror attacks for national security reasons, while hurricanes and other weather emergencies can also lead to flight restrictions. But closing parts of the nation's airspace because of staffing issues would be unprecedented, according to aviation industry experts.",
      "\"In this particular instance, Duffy is talking about staffing. He knows the strain and stress this is taking on air traffic controllers,\" Sheldon Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and an expert on aviation security, told CBS News.",
      "Closing even a portion of the nation's vast airspace would be a major step and likely impact travel nationwide, he added. The system operates on a so-called hub-and-spoke model in which passengers using regional airports can connect with major airports to travel around the U.S.",
      "If the airspace around New York were to close, for example, it could affect passengers in multiple cities, according to Jacobson.",
      "\"For us to take such draconian steps to shut it down in sectors of the country would be unprecedented,\" he said. \"If you shut down the New York area, you shut down a lot of the country because of the interconnectivity of the hub-and-spoke system.\"",
      "More controllers calling in sick",
      "With air traffic controllers working without pay during the shutdown, more than usual are calling in sick, Duffy has said. He has said he is discouraging them from taking on side gigs like delivering for Uber or DoorDash to make ends meet during the funding lapse, given the level of focus that their job requires.",
      "\"The longer this goes on, every day, these hardworking Americans have bills they have to pay, and they're being forced to make decisions and choices,\" Duffy said Tuesday. \"As every day goes by, I think the problem is going to only get worse. Not better.\"",
      "At an Oct. 28 news conference at LaGuardia Airport in New York, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels emphasized that his organization's members are under mounting financial pressures.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "The U.S. Travel Association on Monday urged congressional leaders to end the shutdown, which the industry trade group said could disrupt passengers during the busy Thanksgiving holiday. In 2024, 20 million passengers took to the skies over that week.",
      "\"A shutdown places extraordinary strain on federal personnel who are essential to keeping America moving \u2014 from Transportation Security Administration officers to air traffic controllers, who are forced to work without pay,\" the group said in a Nov. 3 letter. \"When staffing shortages worsen, airport wait times grow longer and flight delays and cancellations become more frequent, threatening to derail family travel plans across the country.\"",

    "summary": "Senators are discussing a deal that would fund the government alongside long-term appropriations bills in exchange for a vote on extending health care tax credits.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The contours of a potential deal to reopen the government began to emerge on Tuesday as the shutdown was poised to become the longest in history, with senators discussing an agreement that would fund the government alongside long-term appropriations bills in exchange for a vote on extending health insurance tax credits that Democrats have demanded.",
      "A bipartisan group of senators has been engaged in conversations in recent days as lawmakers search for an off-ramp in the shutdown fight. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday morning that he's hopeful the bipartisan group is close to a solution, while acknowledging the \"cross-pressures that everybody's feeling\" are \"great.\"",
      "Republicans argue that Democrats are waiting until after Tuesday's elections to back down, claiming they don't want to discourage their base from turning out to vote. A 14th vote on advancing the GOP-backed continuing resolution failed on Tuesday, with no new Democrats crossing the aisle.",
      "Senate Democrats were tight-lipped about a potential deal after a lengthy lunch meeting at the Capitol. \"We had a very good caucus, and we're exploring all the options,\" Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, told reporters that he's \"pretty confident\" the shutdown will end this week: \"I will tell you there's enough Democrats that I'm friends with that were willing to vote last week, and they were assured that Schumer would let them vote the way they need to this week.\"",
      "The bipartisan conversations on Capitol Hill revolve around an effort to move forward on a so-called \"minibus,\" or a package of full-year appropriations bills, in addition to the continuing resolution. Proponents of the plan say that approving the package would demonstrate Republicans' willingness to work on the long-term funding process on a bipartisan basis.",
      "The minibus would include three separate bills. One would fund military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The second would include funding for the legislative branch, and the third would fund the FDA and the Department of Agriculture. Thune told reporters that the continuing resolution to reopen the government could \"ride\" on the appropriations package.",
      "Sen. Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican and appropriator, told reporters on Tuesday that she made calls on the issue through the weekend. She said she's hopeful that a package of appropriations bills can be part of what ends the stalemate.",
      "\"The reason we're in this position is that we have not passed appropriations bills,\" Britt said. \"So beginning to break the logjam through doing that, I think, would be incredibly effective.\"",
      "Still, Republicans need to win over at least five more Democrats to reopen the government with a short-term measure. Republicans have said they are willing to guarantee a vote on extending health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act in exchange for Democrats' votes, an offer that has been on the table for weeks. Some GOP senators think enough Democrats may be now willing to \"take yes for an answer,\" as Thune puts it.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican who is involved in the talks, outlined the thinking to reporters Tuesday. He said that the appropriations package might entice Democrats to \"vote for something other than just simply a continuing resolution\" while providing \"a path forward\" beyond a vote on the health care tax credits.",
      "Republicans have emphasized a return to regular order in this year's appropriations process and have worked to pass all 12 full-year funding bills, as opposed to a massive year-end funding bill. Appropriators are still aiming to accomplish that goal and avoid a year-long continuing resolution or an omnibus package.",
      "But the continuing resolution would only fund the government until Nov. 21, giving appropriators little time to finish full-year funding. Thune has acknowledged that the deadline must be pushed back, though the exact timing remains up in the air.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top appropriator in the upper chamber, advocated on Monday for a December date. Some lawmakers have argued that a December deadline would increase the chances of resolving the funding fight through individual bills while avoiding a full-year stopgap measure.",
      "But House Speaker Mike Johnson ruled out a December continuing resolution on Tuesday morning, saying \"too many people have concerns\" about a pre-holiday deadline that often results in massive omnibus legislation to fund the government. Thune said later in the day that the date is still being discussed, noting that the expectation is that lawmakers will fund the government through the normal appropriations process. He said nobody wants a year-long continuing resolution, which would extend funding at current levels.",
      "Generally, senators said the talks about an off-ramp were more productive, though they were slim on the details. Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat who's been involved in the conversations, said it was a \"sensitive time\" in the talks.",
      "Collins told reporters Monday that \"we are finally making progress\" in the bipartisan conversations, saying she was \"cautiously hopeful\" that the shutdown will be resolved by the end of the week. On Tuesday, she said \"the talks are more productive because they're more specific.\"",
      "Thune said he's hopeful that \"we'll make some progress\" this week. But any one senator could opt to slow down the process, potentially pushing the impasse into next week.",

    "summary": "A Texas-based researcher produced a 26-page study for a defense lawyer in a Jan. 6 Oathkeepers case to argue for a change of venue, which she alleges was \"pirated\" by other attorneys.",
    "story": [
      "A Texas-based researcher has filed a pair of lawsuits against lawyers who represented defendants in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, alleging some of the attorneys \"pirated\" her research and used it in court \u2014 without paying for it.",
      "The lawsuit, filed by Lindsey Olson, alleges the defense attorneys infringed on the copyright on her research studies, when they made filings in court seeking a change of venue for Capitol riot defendants.",
      "Olson's research firm produced a 26-page study in April 2022 for a defense lawyer in a Jan. 6 Oathkeepers case to argue for a change of venue out of Washington, D.C. Among the many findings in Olson's survey, respondents in Washington, D.C. were likely to characterize Jan. 6 as an \"insurrection,\" \"racially motivated\" or \"planned in advance\" than prospective jurors in other regions of the country. The survey also argued the jury pool in Washington, D.C. was more likely to feel \"personally\" affected or less safe, because of the Capitol siege by the mob of Trump supporters.",
      "Dozens of Jan. 6 defendants sought a change-of-venue, several using Olson's research study in their arguments.\u00a0 None of them succeeded in their arguments.\u00a0 But Olson's lawsuits allege some defense attorneys used her study in court, without paying her a fee for her service or the rights to use her material.",
      "James Bartolomei, a civil attorney representing Olson in her lawsuits, told CBS News, \"Each lawyer exploited the entire written report for the very same purpose that she created it, which was for use in support of a motion to transfer venue out of DC. The report has a fair market value of $30,000 per case.\"",
      "One of Olson's lawsuits alleged D.C.-based defense attorney Kira West \"pirated a copyrighted expert report and used that report in three separate criminal cases for the very purpose the report was originally created.\" A CBS News review found Olson's research was included in court motions filed by West in multiple cases, including her defense of Alex Harkrider, who was accused of carrying a tomahawk axe while amid the mob. He was found guilty in 2024 of felony charges of civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon.",
      "Harkrider, along with more than 1,500 other Jan. 6 defendants, was pardoned by President Trump on Inauguration Day 2025.",
      "West declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Olson has filed a separate lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging federal public defenders also misappropriated her jury research while defending Jan. 6 defendants. She alleges federal defenders published her report, in its entirety, at least 11 separate times. The suit alleges Olson \"was unaware of the government's unauthorized use until she stumbled upon a copy of her report with a file stamp of multiple illegible case numbers stamped on top\" of\u00a0 other case numbers.\"",
      "Olson's lawsuit against the Trump administration argues, \"The Government, through the public defenders alleged above, directly benefitted financially from copyright infringement of the April 2022 Report by not paying Plaintiff a reasonable fair market value licensing fee for each use of the Report, which is $30,000 per use.\"",
      "The lawsuit said, \"In exchange for a $30,000 fee, Plaintiff licensed a copy of the Report to the Requesting Attorneys, authorizing them to use it in support of their motions to transfer venue based on alleged prejudicial bias in the District of Columbia's jury pool.\"",
      "Judges universally denied requests by Capitol riot defendants to transfer their cases to other federal districts in America, despite repeated claims that jurors would be biased in the District of Columbia, due to media coverage and personal connections to victims of the attack.",
      "In a statement to CBS News through her attorney, Olson said, \"if everyone stole authors' work all the time, there would eventually be none made at all.\u00a0 Everyone understands that would be wrong.\"",
      "Some judges derided the change-of-venue requests and arguments. A CBS News review of Jan. 6 case hearings found in April 2024, a federal judge denied such a request from a riot defendant and remarked that \"while there has certainly been significant media coverage of Jan. 6, much of it has consisted only of straightforward, unemotional factual accounts of events.\"\u00a0 In July 2023, federal judge Rudolph Contreras rejected another riot defendant's request and ruled, \"a fair trial is possible even where that impact is a result of particularly heinous crimes.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump wrote on Truth Social that federal food benefits \"will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House clarified Tuesday that the Trump administration is complying with a federal court order that requires it to tap into a contingency fund to provide food benefits to tens of millions of Americans after President Trump said the aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will go out only when Democrats vote to end the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "The reassurance from the White House came after the president wrote in a\u00a0post on Truth Social\u00a0that SNAP benefits \"will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comment raised questions as to whether the administration would abide by a Rhode Island judge's order to use reserve funds to issue federal food benefits to Americans enrolled in SNAP. Administration lawyers\u00a0told the court\u00a0Monday that it would tap into the contingency pot to issue reduced food stamp payments for November. The Justice Department said in a filing that the Department of Agriculture would provide states with information necessary for calculating the benefits due to each eligible household, which would allow states to then begin disbursements.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said on X that her agency sent that guidance to states Tuesday morning, but warned it would be a \"cumbersome process\" that could result in a weeks-long delay in food stamp payments going out recipients.",
      "\"If the government opens, families get their FULL benefit much more quickly,\" she wrote.",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's comments by CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration is \"fully complying\" with the court's order, but stressed that \"it's going to take some time\" for recipients to receive the payments.",
      "\"We are digging into a contingency fund that is supposed to be for emergencies, catastrophes, for war, and the president does not want to have to tap into this fund in the future,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt said that in order for beneficiaries to receive their full benefits, Democrats need to vote to fund federal agencies and end the shutdown. Administration officials have said fully covering those allotments for November would require roughly $9 billion, but there is only about $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover this month's benefit payments.",
      "\"Democrats are holding it up and making it difficult for the administration to get those payments out the door,\" she said.",
      "The government shutdown entered its 35th day Tuesday and is on track to become the longest in U.S. history later in the day, surpassing the lapse in federal funding that occurred during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to purchase food each month. The program is funded by the federal government and administered by states, which distribute the nutrition assistance to eligible participants. But the Department of Agriculture said late last month that the food aid would not go out to recipients on Nov. 1 because \"the well has run dry\" amid the government shutdown.",
      "The notice followed the Trump administration's decision not to use roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep the benefits flowing to Americans who rely on SNAP for November. The Department of Agriculture told states in a memo last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to cover regular benefits.\"",
      "Ahead of the cutoff of food benefits at the start of the month, a group of 25 states and the District of Columbia, and a coalition of municipalities and nonprofit organizations,\u00a0filed two different lawsuits claiming the administration's decision to halt food stamp payments was illegal. They sought court orders requiring the Department of Agriculture to use the contingency fund for this month's benefits.",
      "In one of the cases, U.S. District Judge John McConnell on Friday ordered the Trump administration to dip into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP payments caused by the shutdown. The judge, who sits in Rhode Island, gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the money.",
      "In its filing with McConnell submitted Monday, the Justice Department said the Agriculture Department would comply with his order and \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds today\" by providing state agencies with information about reduced SNAP payments.",
      "Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said in a declaration that the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\" He told the court there is roughly $4.6 billion in the reserve for the November payments, which would be used to cover half of eligible households' allotments.",
      "But he warned the aid would likely not go out immediately because of possible \"payment errors and significant delays\" due to variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "Lawyers for the nonprofits and municipalities have\u00a0asked McConnell to issue a new order compelling the Trump administration to provide the full SNAP benefits.",

    "summary": "Sean Dunn has been charged with a misdemeanor felony count for throwing a sandwich at a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent during President Trump's federal takeover of D.C.",
    "story": [
      "A Customs and Border Patrol Agent testified in federal court on Tuesday that a sandwich \"exploded all over him\" after a D.C. man threw a sub-style sandwich at him during an expletive-filled rant in protest of President Trump's federal policing crackdown and National Guard deployment in the nation's capital this summer.",
      "Sean Dunn, who was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault charges, has become a symbol of resistance against Mr. Trump's D.C. policing policies, sat in a crowded courtroom as spectators, jury members, and even witnesses attempted to keep a straight face during the first day of his criminal trial.",
      "\"He did it, he threw the sandwich,\" Dunn's attorney Julia Gatto said in her opening statement to a D.C. jury, adding their client has \"very strong feelings\" about the Trump administration's federal takeover of D.C.",
      "Gatto called the viral sub-toss a \"harmless gesture that did not, could not, cause injury.\"",
      "Customs and Border Patrol Agent Gregory Lairmore, who was hit with the footlong sub, testified Tuesday about his experience dealing with Dunn, who can be seen in video of the incident yelling at the agent and other officers in his vicinity before throwing the wrapped sandwich at the officer's chest. Dunn attempted to flee on foot before being apprehended, documents and video of the incident shows.",
      "According to charging documents, Dunn yelled, \"F*** you! You f***ing fascists! Why are you here? I don't want you in my city,\" before crossing the street. He later returned and threw the sandwich.",
      "Lairmore, who says he caught most of Dunn's ire before catching the sandwich in his ballistic vest, saying at one point Dunn was \"red-faced\" and \"enraged\" by the police presence at a crowded intersection in Northwest Washington, D.C.",
      "To laughs in the room, Lairmore walked the jury through the \"baseball pitch\" of a sub throw, as another witness put it.",
      "Lairmore said he \"could feel it through his ballistic vest\" and it \"exploded all over\" him after the Subway stack hit him. He said he \"could smell the onions and mustard\" on his uniform, and even had an onion string hanging by his police radio later that night. The fast-food mustard, he said, stained his shirt.",
      "Dunn's attorneys later pressed Lairmore on two gag gifts that his coworkers bought him after the incident, including a plush submarine sandwich and a \"felony footlong\" patch that Lairmore said he put on his lunchbox.",
      "They also pressed Lairmore on why there are no evidentiary photos of stains on his shirt or of the sandwich after it was thrown, only a video posted to social media platform Instagram from a bystander showing the sandwich mostly intact. Lairmore said the Metropolitan Police Department in D.C. took over the investigation after Dunn was detained, and Lairmore said the sandwich appeared at least \"bent and out of shape\" in its wrapper.",
      "Federal prosecutors failed to secure a felony indictment\u00a0from a grand jury in Washington in the immediate aftermath of the incident, and instead charged Dunn with a federal misdemeanor assault charge for allegedly assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating and interfering with a federal officer.",
      "After his arrest, Dunn was fired from his job as a paralegal in the Justice Department. According to a Justice Department source, Dunn worked at the Office of International Affairs within the department's Criminal Division as a paralegal.",
      "In a post on X announcing Dunn's firing, Attorney General Pam Bondi called Dunn \"an example of the Deep State we have been up against.\"",
      "Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., said in a video announcing the arrest that her office is \"going to back the police to the hilt. So there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else.\"",

      "Here are the races to watch Tuesday:",
      "New York City mayor's race",
      "New York City's highly watched mayoral election is a rare three-person race that has attracted the attention of a former New Yorker, President Trump.",
      "Democrats chose Queens state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani as their nominee in the June primary, a democratic socialist whose campaign on affordability has been embraced by the grassroots. New York City is heavily Democratic, so the winner of the party's primary is generally considered the favorite to win in November. Mamdani defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who led polls early in the mayoral race.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams, who was indicted on federal corruption charges in September 2024, which were dropped in the early days of the Trump administration, skipped the June Democratic primary, instead opting to be on the ballot as an independent candidate. But facing a lack of funds and polling in the single digits, Adams dropped out in September and later\u00a0threw his support behind Cuomo.",
      "Cuomo has remained in the race, and although he lagged in raising money earlier in the race, his fundraising improved in October after Adams dropped out. Mamdani, meanwhile, has shattered fundraising expectations, with his campaign saying it reached the $8 million spending cap for New York City matching funds in early September.",
      "A trio of polls released on Oct. 30 showed Mamdani with a commanding lead, though others earlier in the week showed an uptick in support for Cuomo. Early voting has substantially risen compared to 2021. Since Oct. 25, more than 730,000 New Yorkers\u00a0have cast their ballots early, compared to the\u00a0nearly 170,000 who cast their ballots early in 2021.",
      "If Mamdani, 34, wins, he will become the second-youngest mayor in New York City history as well as the first Muslim mayor. He was first elected to the state Assembly in 2020 to represent Astoria, Queens \u2014 one of the most progressive parts of New York City. Mamdani said he will ask New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch to stay on if he wins. She has not yet said whether she will accept.",
      "Cuomo, who was elected New York governor three times before resigning amid sexual misconduct allegations, has tried to paint Mamdani as an elitist, since his father is a Columbia University professor and his mother is a film director. Cuomo's father, Mario Cuomo, was a three-term governor of New York. Andrew Cuomo has also attacked Mamdani for living in a rent-stabilized apartment, even as Cuomo himself moved to his daughter's apartment in New York City before he ran for mayor.",
      "Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee in 2021, is back on the ballot on the GOP line, although some Republicans have called on him to drop out to help Cuomo's candidacy. Mr. Trump has called Sliwa \"not exactly prime time\" and suggested Cuomo would be a better mayor.",

      "New Jersey governor's race",
      "Former GOP New Jersey state Rep. Jack Ciattarelli is making his third run for governor, after losing to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021. He's facing off against Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who's trying to deliver Democrats a third consecutive term in the governor's mansion, a feat that has not been accomplished by either party since the 1970s.",
      "Sherrill, who flipped a Republican congressional seat in 2018, is running as a moderate and trying to tie Ciattarelli to Mr. Trump. But Ciattarelli has accused Sherrill in a September debate of blaming Mr. Trump for everything.",
      "Both Ciattarelli and Sherrill are appealing to voters' concerns about the high cost of living: Ciattarelli is touting a \"Make New Jersey Affordable Again\" pitch, while Sherrill features an \"Affordability Agenda\" on her campaign website.",
      "In September, CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records to an ally of Ciattarelli in error. Republicans allied with Ciattarelli have been examining Sherrill's record in the Navy, looking for information about a Naval Academy cheating scandal that implicated over 100 midshipmen. Sherrill was not accused of wrongdoing but did not walk in her graduation, which she said was because she \"didn't turn in some of my classmates.\" Sherrill had an unblemished career in the Navy and, as a midshipman, received a Navy Achievement Medal in 1991 for saving the life of a classmate.",
      "Virginia governor's race",
      "Virginia governors may not run for consecutive terms under state law, so Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is not on the ballot.",
      "Virginia's gubernatorial election is often seen as a potential referendum on the incumbent president. The president's party often loses the Virginia governor's race, which always falls in the year following a presidential election. In recent history, Terry McAuliffe bucked that trend when he won the election in 2013, a year after President Barack Obama's reelection.",
      "The Trump administration's broadsides against the federal workforce hit Virginia hard, since the state has hundreds of thousands of civilian federal employees and thousands of government contractors and active-duty military. Most are going without pay during the government shutdown that's now stretching into its second month.",
      "Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is running against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in the race. Either Spanberger or Earle-Sears will make history as the commonwealth's first female governor, and if Earle-Sears wins, she will become the first female Black governor.",
      "One of Youngkin's paths to victory in 2021 was tying McAuliffe, who was running for a non-consecutive term, to unpopular progressive social issues, which Earle-Sears has tried to replicate in the race against Spanberger. But Spanberger, a former CIA operations officer, has run as a centrist and has touted endorsements from the Virginia Police Benevolent Association, which backed Youngkin in 2021, as well as former Republican Reps. Barbara Comstock and Denver Riggleman.",

      "In a statement to CBS News when the messages resurfaced, Jones said he took full responsibility for his actions.",
      "But Republicans, including the president, have called on Jones to drop out. Miyares has seized on the controversy, running ads saying, \"Can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?\"",
      "In a Washington Post poll conducted from Oct. 16-21 \u2014 after the text messages were released \u2014 Jones and Miyares were statistically tied with 46% each.",
      "California's Proposition 50",
      "Proposition 50 would allow California Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. The initiative is their response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.",
      "California has 52 congressional districts, 43 represented by Democrats and nine by Republicans. The five GOP-led districts targeted under Proposition 50 are District 1, represented by Rep. Doug LaMalfa; District 3, represented by Rep. Kevin Kiley; District 22, represented by Rep. David Valadao; District 41, represented by Rep. Ken Calvert; and District 48, represented by Rep. Darrell Issa.",

      "\"We're going to get out there and win and send a powerful message not only to the people of the state of California, but the people all over the United States of America,\" Newsom said.",
      "A recent CBS News poll found that among voters who plan to support Proposition 50, one reason they're doing so is to oppose the Trump administration \u2014 which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states \u2014 and oppose national Republicans.",
      "Prop 50, according to the poll, has 62% support among likely voters.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 09:54:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court will consider Wednesday whether a federal emergency powers law gives President Trump the authority to impose his most sweeping tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For Lindsay Hagerman, the past few months have felt tumultuous.",
      "As the co-owner of the Pennsylvania-based RainCaper, which sells art-inspired travel accessories and gifts, Hagerman has found herself questioning her pricing strategy while watching tariffs on goods imported from China see-saw from 10% to 20% to 145% \u2014 and then back down again.",
      "\"Is it temporary? Is this the new normal? You're struggling with how do we price \u2014 do we change prices now? Wait? I don't want to gouge people,\" Hagerman told CBS News. \"That's not how you do good business. But I also need to cover expenses.\"",
      "RainCaper, which Hagerman founded with her mother nearly a decade ago, sells rain capes, travel accessories, umbrellas, scarves, shawls and drinkware to boutiques, museum stores, retailers and directly to consumers through its website.",
      "Her company imports umbrellas and rain capes made from a waterproof fabric from China, and neither can be made in the U.S., Hagerman said. As a result, RainCaper has found itself on the front lines of President Trump's trade war, which relies heavily on tariffs.",
      "But Hagerman and small business owners across the U.S. could see some stability in the coming weeks, with the Supreme Court set to consider Wednesday whether Mr. Trump has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on nearly every country under a federal emergency powers law.",
      "Lower courts have ruled his most sweeping duties are illegal, and a decision from the Supreme Court upholding those decisions could deal a blow to the president's efforts to use tariffs as leverage in negotiations with foreign countries and to pressure U.S. companies to invest in domestic manufacturing. But a ruling from the high court against Mr. Trump, who appointed three of the justices, could also have significant implications for presidential power.",
      "Since he announced the sweeping global tariffs earlier this year, many small businesses have had to devote time and resources to keeping up with the fast-changing fluctuations in the tariff rates and countries targeted, all while making determinations about how to respond to the increased costs of importing the components needed for their products.",
      "At RainCaper, Hagerman has trimmed expenses and laid off two of its seven employees who were working in operations and customer service, she said.",
      "She also explored manufacturing outside of China because of the levies, though Hagerman ultimately decided against it in part because of the significant investment it would require. And as a military spouse whose husband is out of state, she said making trips to countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia to look at other potential facilities wasn't possible.",
      "\"When the administration is saying we're bringing trillions into the economy and saying China is paying these tariffs, Brazil is paying these tariffs, it's just not true,\" Hagerman said. \"Tariffs are borne by the importer. I'm the importer.\"",
      "A \"stark choice\" for the Supreme Court",
      "Mr. Trump has invoked a federal law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose two different sets of tariffs through a series of executive orders. The first set a baseline rate of 10% on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as well as higher reciprocal tariffs on more than 50 countries; and the second targeted China, Canada and Mexico with tariffs of varying rates.",
      "In his executive orders, the president declared trade deficits and the flood of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. as national emergencies, which unlocked IEEPA's powers. The law authorizes the president to \"regulate \u2026 importation\" to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security, foreign policy or the U.S. economy, which he said trade imbalances and drug trafficking constitute.",
      "Since Mr. Trump announced the tariffs in February and April \u2014 on what he called \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 the administration has reached trade deals with 10 countries and the European Union, and said it is \"actively negotiating\" with more foreign nations.",
      "But soon after the president announced the tariffs, two sets of small businesses and a group of 12 states filed lawsuits arguing that IEEPA doesn't authorize the sweeping duties. Lower courts have ruled against the administration, finding that IEEPA doesn't give the president the power to unilaterally impose the global and trafficking tariffs.",
      "In one of the cases, involving a group of five small businesses and Democratic officials from 12 states, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7-4 that many of the president's levies are illegal. But the Federal Circuit set aside a lower court's injunction, which has allowed the Trump administration to keep collecting the global and trafficking tariffs for now.",
      "Mr. Trump has also continued to rely on IEEPA to impose new levies or tweak existing rates, including raising Canadian tariffs to 35%, though many of its goods are exempt,\u00a0imposing an additional 40% duty on Brazil and threatening China with an additional 100% duty, though the president has since walked that back. Mr. Trump then announced last week after a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would be reducing the tariffs on goods imported from China.",
      "The Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to uphold the levies, arguing that Congress has long given the president broad authority to impose tariffs to address emergencies. Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing\u00a0that IEEPA is a continuation of that tradition because it gives the president the power to \"regulate \u2026 importation.\"",
      "Sauer also asserted that the tariffs are an exercise of Mr. Trump's power over national security and foreign affairs, and argued courts should give deference to his determination that the duties are best suited for addressing national emergencies arising from trade deficits and drug trafficking.",
      "Invalidating those levies, he said, would have \"catastrophic consequences\" for national security, foreign policy and the economy.",
      "\"To the President, these cases present a stark choice: With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump has called the case \"one of the most important in the history of the country\" and had said he planned to attend the arguments in-person. But he reversed course Sunday, writing on social media that he did \"not want to distract from the importance of this decision.\"",
      "Lawyers for the small businesses told the high court in papers that Mr. Trump's tariffs have significant economic consequences. An analysis from the Tax Foundation found the duties will impose $1.7 trillion in new taxes on Americans by 2035, reduce GDP growth by 0.7% per year, and reduce income by 1.1% in 2026.",
      "No president has used IEEPA to levy tariffs \u2014 until now \u2014 and the law makes no mention of that word or others like it. Neal Katyal, who will argue on behalf of the small businesses before the Supreme Court, warned in filings that the Trump administration's interpretation of IEEPA is a \"breathtaking assertion\" of power that requires explicit authorization from Congress.",
      "If the Supreme Court agrees with Mr. Trump that the power to tax is found in IEEPA through the phrase \"regulate \u2026 importation,\" then \"the president, empowered by a supercharged U.S. Code, could tax everything from autos to zoos,\" Katyal wrote in a filing.",
      "\"The government's theory is really that the president has the ability to impose sales taxes, property taxes, use taxes, essentially a wealth tax under IEEPA,\" Timothy Meyer, an expert in international law at Duke Law, told CBS News. \"The justices are going to have to confront this really extraordinary breadth of the government's argument.\"",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that trade deficits hardly constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat,\" as imbalances have lasted for five decades, and Mr. Trump himself has described them as \"persistent.\"",
      "Additionally, the power to levy taxes and duties rests squarely with Congress, and any delegations of that power have been \"explicit and strictly limited,\" they said. And indeed, there are numerous other statutes in which Congress has delegated its tariffing power \u2014 some of which have been used by Mr. Trump \u2014 though they put constraints on the president.",
      "\"The reason that President Trump likes IEEPA is because unlike every other statute that delegates to the president the authority to impose tariffs, IEEPA requires no process before the president can act, requires no investigation, no fact-finding other than an unreviewable declaration of a national emergency, and it places no limits on what the president can do in terms of the amount of the duty or the length of time that they can remain in place,\" Meyer said.",
      "He continued: \"The reason it doesn't do any of those things is because it doesn't mention duties at all, so it seems pretty likely that Congress did not intend to include substantial power to impose tariffs in the statute.\"",
      "Jeffrey Bialos, a partner at Eversheds Sutherland who specializes in international law, predicted that if Mr. Trump prevails before the Supreme Court, future administrations would likely use IEEPA's authority to set out broad tariffs rather than look to other authorities that are more narrow and impose certain requirements.",
      "\"This isn't foreign affairs. It's a question of what is permissible to delegate under Article I Section 8, and what kind of authority you need,\" Bialos said. \"Did Congress intend to allow the president to throw out the entire tariff code of the United States? That's the import of what was done here.\"",
      "A test of presidential authority",
      "Mr. Trump has spent his first months back in the White House flexing his presidential authority in other ways, including through his firings of executive branch officials and the withholding of $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress.",
      "When those cases made their way to the Supreme Court in their early stages, the conservative justices have in most instances allowed the Trump administration to temporarily enforce certain policies while proceedings in the lower courts continue.",
      "In the dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs, the Supreme Court will weigh the legal merits of the case, something it has not yet done in the others. But the court battle, like those others, could have implications for the power the president is seeking to assert.",
      "\"What the Supreme Court is really deciding here is whether or not to give the administration a free pass any time it's able to connect some sort of policy initiative to some sort of international dimension,\" Meyer said. \"If you create a system in which you get deference if you can characterize something as a foreign affairs issue, but there's no deference if it's done by an administrative agency pursuing some sort of statutory delegation, then the administration will just do as much as it can through emergency and international affairs powers.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad assertions of executive authority on issues of major political and economic significance when Congress has not spoken clearly, invoking what's called the major questions doctrine to invalidate former President Joe Biden's plan to wipe away more than $400 billion in student loan debt and block an eviction moratorium during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "That legal principle is raised in the battle over his tariffs, though the Trump administration argues that it doesn't apply to matters of national security and foreign policy. But lawyers for the small businesses counter that tariffs are a tax on the American people, and the Constitution has vested the taxing power in Congress.",
      "\"Taxing American citizens is not national security or foreign policy, and the tariffs are paid by Emily Ley and other ordinary Americans,\" said Mark Chenoweth, president and chief legal officer at the New Civil Liberties Alliance. The organization is representing a Pensacola-based stationary company and its CEO, Emily Ley, in a different challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs. That case is not before the Supreme Court.",
      "\"To argue that unilateral taxation of American citizens is national security or foreign policy is incorrect,\" Chenoweth said. \"We fought a Revolutionary War over the idea of taxation without representation, and that's what this would be if the president can unilaterally raise taxes on American citizens.\"",
      "A \"mass extinction\" of small businesses",
      "While lower courts have agreed that Mr. Trump's global and trafficking tariffs are illegal, the government has continued to collect the duties as the Supreme Court weighs the cases.",
      "For Julie Robbins, CEO of EarthQuaker Devices, that has meant paying nearly $40,000 in levies through the end of October.",
      "The family-owned company makes guitar pedals and manufactures its products in Akron, Ohio. EarthQuaker's product line includes 50 pedals that require more than 900 unique components that it sources from 15 different countries, including Mexico, Portugal, Poland, Ukraine and several in Asia.",
      "To assist with logistics, Robbins said EarthQuaker works with wholesalers that vet overseas manufacturers and source the mechanical and electrical components needed for its pedals. The wholesalers are paying the tariffs when the items arrive at U.S. ports and then pass along a portion of the duties to EarthQuaker, she said.",
      "Upon hearing Mr. Trump would be imposing his sweeping levies, one of Robbins' first moves was to search for domestic suppliers. She ultimately found they either don't exist for the parts that go into EarthQuaker's guitar pedals or they charge significantly more than her international sources.",
      "Plus, breaking off long-held relationships with overseas suppliers would be risky and disrupt a supply chain that took years to perfect, she said, since there were no guarantees other manufacturers or their products would be reliable.",
      "\"It's taken us 20 years to develop this supply chain,\" she said. \"It's not something that happened overnight and so in order to redo it, I can't see it happening.\"",
      "Robbins said EarthQuaker could save money by having their pedals made in-full overseas, rather than having the parts shipped to the U.S. and the pedals assembled at its production facilities in Ohio. But doing that wouldn't align with the company's values of keeping well-paying jobs in Akron, a city that was once known as the \"Rubber Capital of the World\" for its production of rubber products.",
      "\"When people try to oversimplify and say you should be manufacturing in the United States, we are manufacturing in the United States, but you can't make the raw materials in the U.S.,\" Robbins said.",
      "EarthQuaker doesn't have deep-pocketed investors and has eroded its cash cushion as it has navigated the whiplash of changing tariff rates, she said. The company also opted not to replace employees that have left in recent months, and it pulled two open positions.",
      "\"My concern is there's just going to be this mass extinction of small business,\" Robbins said. \"It's not sustainable.\"",
      "Cephalofair Games, a California-based company that designs and publishes board games, has paid more than $144,000 in new tariffs over the past few months, according to its chief operating officer, Price Johnson.",
      "In July, Cephalofair informed its customers it would be adding \"tariff surcharges\" as a result of the import taxes and has increased the prices of its products. It has also reduced the salaries of staff and furloughed workers.",
      "The company manufactures its games in China and has had to make adjustments to product runs in response to the tariffs. Johnson told CBS News that a run of 7,000 units is nearly completed, but instead of bringing it into the U.S., the company will instead send its games to Europe, the United Kingdom and Australia.",
      "In the meantime, Johnson said the company continues to design and develop new games, but is waiting to hear from the Supreme Court before moving forward with manufacturing.",
      "Cephalofair wasn't impacted by tariffs during the first administration and had been preparing for tariffs on Chinese imports of between 10% and 15%, Johnson said. But these days, he and his colleagues have taken to watching Mr. Trump's social media feed for tariff-related announcements.",
      "The uncertainty has \"removed any ability for us to plan or rely on what we as importers can operate on,\" Johnson said. \"We have to plan on not being able to plan or trust what U.S. policy is surrounding trade.\"",

    "summary": "Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein provided the Justice Department with \"precise and detailed\" information about 20 alleged co-conspirators, House Democrats say.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, is seeking documents from the Justice Department on its move earlier this year to end the investigation into alleged co-conspirators of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"I write to demand an explanation for why DOJ has abandoned the women and girls abused by Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and their co-conspirators, fired or cut off career prosecutors from the case, and ceased its investigation into one of the largest sex trafficking rings in history,\" Raskin wrote in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, which was first obtained by CBS News.",
      "The demand comes amid relentless bipartisan interest in the investigation, which has dogged the Justice Department's top officials as they've sought to put the matter to rest. Some in the Trump administration, including Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, promised major revelations into the Epstein matter before taking office, only to indicate later that the case was closed.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on Raskin's letter and will update this story with any response.",
      "In the letter, Raskin said almost 50 survivors provided information to prosecutors and FBI agents as part of the investigation that ultimately led to the indictments of Epstein in 2019 and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2020. Raskin said the information the survivors provided was \"precise and detailed.\"",
      "\"They described how Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and their co-conspirators orchestrated a sophisticated and clandestine sex trafficking conspiracy that trafficked them to at least 20 men,\" Raskin said. \"These survivors shared with DOJ and FBI the specific identities of many of these co-conspirators, how this operation was structured and financed, and which individuals facilitated these crimes.\"",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York was running an active investigation into Epstein and Maxwell's co-conspirators until January 2025, when prosecutors were directed to transfer the Epstein case files to the Justice Department's headquarters, in what Raskin said was \"a sudden and dramatic shift in the posture of the investigation.\" Since then, \"the investigation into co-conspirators has inexplicably ceased,\" he said, citing information provided to the Judiciary Committee by attorneys who represent Epstein survivors.",
      "Then in July, the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review, which it said found no \"client list\" among the evidence collected by investigators. It also \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate any investigation against uncharged third parties.\" Bondi suggested during a Fox News interview in February that a \"client list\" was sitting on her desk awaiting her review.",
      "\"DOJ and FBI's failure to investigate this conduct is a betrayal of the more than 1,000 survivors of this multi-billion-dollar international sex trafficking ring,\" Raskin wrote. \"As these survivors made clear to DOJ and FBI, Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell did not act alone.\"",
      "Raskin said many of the women spoke with prosecutors and agents, and the interviews were summarized in 302 forms, a document used by the FBI to memorialize information that may later come up in courtroom testimony. Along with the women, Raskin said federal law enforcement agents who worked on the case understood that the investigation was continuing up until January. In Supreme Court filings, Raskin pointed out, the government said the pursuit of Epstein's co-conspirators was ongoing during the Biden administration.",
      "Raskin said the committee is considering reforms that would clarify prosecutors' responsibility to communicate with crime survivors before investigations are closed. And he accused Patel of having \"repeatedly impugned the credibility of the Epstein survivors\" at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in September by suggesting that the information provided by the survivors was not credible.",
      "During the hearing, Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has led an effort to force a vote in the House on releasing the Epstein files, pointed to 20 alleged co-conspirators.",
      "\"According to victims who cooperated with the FBI in that investigation, these documents in FBI possession, your possession, detail at least 20 men, including Mr. Jes Staley, CEO of Barclays Bank,\" Massie said, referring to a banker who left Barclays in 2021 amid scrutiny over his ties to Epstein. Staley, who worked with Epstein for years as a top official at J.P. Morgan, has said they had a \"close professional relationship.\" Staley has denied wrongdoing and said he regrets befriending Epstein.",
      "Massie said other high-profile figures were among those named by Epstein's victims.",
      "\"That list also includes at least 19 other individuals \u2014 one Hollywood producer worth a few hundred million dollars, one royal prince, one high-profile individual in the music industry, one very prominent banker, one high-profile government official, one high-profile former politician, one owner of a car company in Italy, one rockstar, one magician, at least six billionaires, including a billionaire from Canada,\" Massie said.",
      "Massie asked Patel if the FBI had launched any investigations into the individuals and whether he'd seen the 302 documents. Patel responded that he has asked FBI agents to \"review the entirety of the Epstein files and bring forth any credible information.\" He said \"any investigations that arise from any credible investigation will be brought,\" but he added that there have been \"no new materials brought to me launching a new indictment.\"",
      "Asked whether he was asserting that the victims' statements weren't credible, Patel said, \"It's not my assertion, sir, it's the assertion of two different United States attorneys' offices from three separate administrations who investigated those same materials in live time.\"",
      "Raskin said Patel's explanation, along with a later exchange with Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, was not good enough. He wrote in his letter that he is seeking \"an accounting\" of the steps the Justice Department has taken to review the case this year, relevant summaries or reports generated as part of that review and documents related to staffing for Epstein investigative matters.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has inexplicably killed this investigation,\" Raskin said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dinosaur-mystery-t-rex-rival-species-researchers-say/",
    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 13:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" the study's co-author said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have long puzzled over the origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur?",
      "At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn't settle the controversy.",
      "Now, a research team says new evidence resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton \u2014 first uncovered in Montana in 2006 \u2014 that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University.",
      "Growth rings within the bones found in Montana's Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature's skull and an adult T. rex's \u2014 changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses \u2014 were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.",
      "Signs pointed to a dinosaur that's a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature, calling it a rival species.",
      "\"Nanotyrannus is a small-bodied predator designed for speed. It's very agile and has long powerful arms [that are] larger than those of the T. rex,\"\u00a0Zanno told Nature.",
      "There's now \"more support and evidence than there ever has been\" that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she's not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new.",
      "Case of mistaken identity",
      "Other independent scientists also said the debate isn't over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.",
      "There are similarities between the shape of T. rex's skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps.",
      "\"I don't think this study settles everything,\" he said.",
      "Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago \u2014 or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.",
      "\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The new skeleton is dubbed \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.",
      "The study comes just days after new research suggested dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike. The evidence came from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "In June, scientists identified a smaller-bodied ancestor of the T. rex that roamed the plains of Mongolia as a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump is nominating Jared Isaacman to serve as his NASA administrator after all.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has decided once again to nominate Jared Isaacman to serve as his NASA administrator, he announced Tuesday evening, months after withdrawing the tech billionaire and private astronaut's nomination because of concerns about his political leanings.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Isaacman to the Senate-confirmed post last year, but announced in late May he had decided to withdraw Isaacman after a \"thorough review\" of his \"prior associations.\"",
      "Weeks after the withdrawal, the president went further in expressing his concerns about Isaacman's credentials. At the time, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he thought Isaacman \"was very good,\" but had been \"surprised to learn\" that Isaacman was a \"blue-blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.\"",
      "Federal Election Commission records\u00a0show\u00a0Isaacman has donated to Democratic congressional candidates and Democratic aligned groups, though he has also given some money to Republicans. Isaacman has\u00a0described himself\u00a0as \"relatively apolitical\" and a \"right-leaning moderate,\" and said he disclosed his political donations to Democrats prior to his nomination.",
      "Isaacman has had the endorsement of a powerful fellow tech entrepreneur, Mr. Trump's former adviser, Elon Musk. Isaacman, the CEO and founder of credit card-processing company Shift4, has been a close collaborator with Musk ever since buying his first chartered flight with Musk's company SpaceX. He bought a series of spaceflights from SpaceX, which has extensive contracts with NASA to transport astronauts and equipment.",
      "The president and Musk had a very public falling-out earlier this year, but are now on better terms. Last week, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Musk have spoken \"on and off\" since sitting together at conservative activist Charlie Kirk's funeral last month in Arizona and that their relationship is \"good.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested that he withdrew Isaacman's nomination in part because of his relationship with Musk, saying he \"thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life.\"",
      "Isaacman said on X he \"only know[s] Elon professionally\" and does not own any equity in SpaceX, but he has a \"firsthand appreciation for what he and his companies have accomplished.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made no mention of his previous decision to nominate and then withdraw Isaacman in his Tuesday evening announcement of the re-nomination on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\"This evening, I am pleased to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of NASA,\" Trump posted. \"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman thanked the president and the \"space-loving community\" Tuesday in a post on X, writing: \"I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been serving as interim NASA administrator. The president on Tuesday praised Duffy for doing an \"incredible job.\"",
      "The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved Isaacman's nomination in late April and a vote by the full Senate had been expected when Mr. Trump announced he was yanking the nomination.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have spotted the brightest flare yet from a supermassive black hole that shines with the light of 10 trillion suns.",
      "These bursts of light and energy can come from things like tangled-up magnetic fields or hiccups in the heated gas disks surrounding black holes. The flares help illuminate researchers' understanding of the black holes within.",
      "The flare came from a supermassive black hole that's 10 billion light years away, making the flash the most distant one observed so far. It hails from a time when the universe was rather young. A light year is nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "The latest cosmic display was spotted in 2018 by a camera at the Palomar Observatory in California. It took about three months to shine at peak brightness and has been decaying in the years since.",
      "It likely happened because a large star wandered too close to the black hole and got shredded to pieces.",
      "\"At first, we didn't really believe the numbers about the energy,\" said study author Matthew Graham with the California Institute of Technology, which operates Palomar.",
      "The new findings were published Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "Almost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its center. The immense pull of that black hole, which is surrounded by powerful magnetic fields, gives the Milky Way its characteristic swirl.",
      "Scientists still aren't sure how supermassive black holes form.",
      "Studying such behemoths can help researchers better understand the stellar neighborhood surrounding supermassive black holes. The discovery also allows scientists \"to probe the interaction of supermassive black holes with their environments early in the universe,\" said Joseph Michail with Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which didn't have a role in the new study. Those early interactions created the cosmos humans now call home.",
      "The oldest black hole yet discovered was spotted by scientists in March 2024. That supermassive black hole was formed when our 13.8 billion-year-old universe was just 430 million years old. The black hole is at the center of a distant galaxy and is vigorously growing, researchers said.",
      "Another ancient supermassive black hole was discovered\u00a0by NASA researchers in 2023. That one was formed about 13.2 billion years ago, making it about 40 million years older than the one found in 2024. It is about 10 times bigger than the Milky Way's black hole.",
      "Meanwhile, the nearest supermassive black hole is just about 1,600 light-years from Earth and is about 10 times the size of the sun.",

      "The Shenzhou-21 and its crew blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China atop a Long March-2F rocket just before midnight on Friday, or about 11 a.m. Eastern.",
      "The taikonauts on board \u2014 Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang \u2014 will rotate in so the trio currently on board the Chinese space station from the Shenzhou-20 mission, which launched on April 24, can come back home after their six-months in space. The exact date of their return has yet to be announced.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew are scheduled to conduct a total of 27 scientific and applied research projects during their mission, focusing on multiple fields including space life sciences, biotechnology, space medicine, space materials science, microgravity fluid physics and combustion and new space technologies, according to information provided by the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).",
      "Along with the taikonauts, Shenzhou-21 is carrying four mice \u2014 two females and two males \u2014 the first live mammals ever carried by China into space. Two previous missions to the Tiangong station carried live fish.",
      "The taikonauts will study the effects of microgravity and confined space conditions on the behavioral patterns of mice.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew, with Lu as their commander are scheduled to live aboard the space station for approximately six months, just like the crew they are replacing.",
      "It won't be the first visit to the station for Lu, who previously served on the Shenzhou-15 mission.",

      "Crowds gathered around the Jiuquan launch site on Friday ahead of the countdown, and a man who identified himself to CBS News only as Mr. Zhao said he was \"very excited\" to be there with his 7-year-old son, \"hoping to plant the seed of a space dream into his heart.\"",
      "China's growing \"space dream\"",
      "China has ramped up its space program unilaterally since being excluded from the International Space Station project \u2014   largely over the U.S. government's concerns about the Chinese military's full control over its program \u2014   to achieve its \"space dream\" under President Xi Jinping.",
      "It has manned the Tiangong station since 2021, and there are now plans to bring the first non-Chinese crewmember aboard the facility.",
      "China will arrange for one Pakistani national to undertake a short-term space mission in the future, the CMSA has said, following the signing of a cooperation agreement between the two countries in February.",

      "Following the selection process, two Pakistani nationals will travel to China to train alongside Chinese taikonauts for future missions, the CMSA said.",
      "CMSA spokesperson Zhang Jingbo said during a news conference this week ahead of the Shenzhou-21 launch that China would welcome international partners to participate in missions aboard its space station.",
      "The work done on China's space station coincides with and often compliments the nation's efforts to be the first nation to land a person on the moon's surface in more than 40 years. Chinese officials have made it a public goal to land taikonauts on the moon's surface by 2030, and eventually to build a lunar base.",

    "story": [
      "At least seven people were killed and several others injured after a UPS plane crashed shortly after takeoff near the Louisville International Airport on Tuesday, officials said.",
      "The number of fatalities is expected to increase, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear wrote on social media Tuesday night. At least 11 people were injured, officials said earlier.",
      "Beshear said in a statement Wednesday morning that 16 families have reported loved ones who are unaccounted for. \"A significant search and rescue mission was underway overnight, which is continuing this morning,\" he said.",
      "Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg confirmed at a news conference Tuesday night that at least four people had been killed on the ground.",
      "UPS Flight 2976 crashed around 5:15 p.m. local time after it departed from the Louisville airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The aircraft was headed to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, Hawaii, when it went down three miles south of the airfield, Louisville airport public safety officer Jonathan Biven said at a news conference.",
      "Beshear said there was no hazardous cargo onboard the plane that would create environmental issues around the crash site, but urged residents to follow any shelter-in-place orders.",
      "The Louisville Metro Police Department described the scene as active with \"fire and debris,\" warning residents to stay away from Fern Valley and Grade Lane, an intersection located on the south side of the airport, which serves as the hub of UPS.",
      "More than 100 firefighters responded to the crash and were still battling hot spots as of Tuesday night, Greenberg said. Louisville Fire Chief Brian O'Neill noted the fire was \"almost entirely contained.\"",
      "Greenberg noted on social media Wednesday morning that there were more than 200 first responders of all types at the scene in all.",
      "O'Neill said the fire had been extinguished enough to allow a formal grid search for any possible victims in the area.",
      "Videos of the crash showed the aircraft partially on fire as it sped down the runway before it burst into flames.",
      "A shelter-in-place order was reduced to a one-mile radius of the crash site, authorities said. Then Greenberg said in his post Wednesday morning it was down to a quarter-mile radius.",
      "The police department also urged those in the area to turn off any air intake systems as soon as possible due to the smoke in the area.",
      "\"Anybody who has seen the images and the video knows how violent this crash is, and there are a lot of families that are gonna be waiting and wondering for a period of time. We're going to try to get them that information as fast as we can,\" Beshear said.",
      "UPS said in a statement that it was notified of an incident involving one of its aircraft. Three UPS crewmembers were on board, the company said. It didn't immediately provide more details.",
      "\"We do not at the moment have the status of the crew,\" Beshear said. \"Watching that video, I think we're all very, very worried about them.\"",
      "Businesses in the area were heavily impacted by the crash, including Kentucky Petroleum Recycling and Grade A Auto Parts, the governor said.",
      "All arriving and departing flights at the Louisville airport were temporarily suspended. The airport was closed Tuesday night but one runway as reopened Wednesday morning, Greenberg said.",
      "According to preliminary flight data from FlightRadar24, the plane appeared to hit 175 feet in altitude briefly after takeoff. It would have been full of fuel for the flight to Hawaii, which likely led to the significant fire as seen from CBS affiliate WLKY-TV's chopper.",
      "The three-engine McDonnell Douglas MD-11 was manufactured in 1991, according to FAA data.",
      "It was carrying approximately 38,000 gallons of fuel, which weighs about 233,000 pounds, Louisville Fire Chief Brian O'Neill said. The area affected by the crash is about a city block wide, he said, but it has been difficult to contain the fire due to surrounding hazardous materials.",
      "Greenberg urged any residents who find debris on their property not to touch it, and instead report it through a website that should be live by Wednesday.",
      "The crash is where UPS Worldport, an international air hub for the parcel service, is located. UPS said it was halting package sorting operations at Worldport on Tuesday night.",
      "\"This is a UPS town,\" Louisville Metro Councilwoman Betsy Ruhe, whose district is part of the crash site, said during the news conference Tuesday night. \"We all know somebody who works at UPS, and they're all texting their friends, their family, trying to make sure everyone is safe. Sadly, some of those texts are probably going to go unanswered.\"",
      "The 5.2 million-square-foot facility processes more than 400,000 packages an hour and is home to 20,000 UPS workers and 300 daily flights, according to the company.",
      "\"My team and I are closely monitoring the plane crash near Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport,\" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said. \"We continue to pray for the safety of the aircrew, everyone in the area, and for the first-responders on the scene.\"",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation into the crash. A team of 28 investigators is expected to arrive Wednesday, Greenberg said.",
      "All public schools in the Jefferson County School District, the largest school district in Kentucky with a little under 100,000 students, will be closed Wednesday, Greenberg added.",

      "The 34-year-old democratic socialist defeated Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent after losing a Democratic primary that he had initially entered as the clear front-runner. The mayoral race drew the attention of President Trump, who endorsed Cuomo the night before the election and threatened to withhold federal funds to New York City under a Mayor Mamdani.",
      "Mamdani's message centered around the cost of living, energizing a coalition of young and progressive voters, even as critics questioned his lack of experience and raised concerns about his stance on Israel. He pledged to freeze rents on rent-stabilized apartments and raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for a host of new services, like free buses and city-run grocery stores.",
      "When he assumes office, Mamdani will make history as the city's first Muslim mayor. At 34, he'll also be one of the city's youngest mayors, but not the youngest ever: That distinction belongs to Hugh J. Grant, who was 31 when he was elected to his first term in 1889.",

      "Mamdani promised to bring New York City into an age of \"relentless improvement\" as he claimed victory in the mayoral race late Tuesday night.",
      "He said his win was one for the working people of New York and reiterated his campaign promises on affordability.",
      "\"Let the words we've spoken together, the dreams we've dreamt together become the agenda we deliver together,\" Mamdani said. \"New York, this power, it's yours. This city belongs to you. Thank you.\"",
      "Mamdani's background",
      "Mamdani was born in Uganda and moved to New York City when he was 7. He attended the elite Bronx High School of Science before heading off to Bowdoin College.",
      "In 2018, he became an American citizen.",
      "His parents are political science professor Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair. Mamdani is married to artist Rama Duawaji. They live in Queens, where Mamdani has served as state assemblyman since 2021, representing Astoria, Astoria Heights and Ditmars-Steinway in Queens.",
      "Mamdani's policies",
      "Mamdani focused his campaign around reducing the cost of living. He promised to freeze the rent for\u00a0the city's rent-stabilized units. He has also pledged to provide\u00a0free bus service\u00a0and to open city-owned grocery stores in each borough. Mamdani also says he wants to build 200,000 affordable housing units.",
      "To pay for his proposals, Mamdani has said he would raise taxes on corporations and on top earners by 2%, but he'll need the help of Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state legislature to do it.",
      "His candidacy was enthusiastically embraced by prominent fellow progressives like\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0and\u00a0Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He eventually got the endorsement of some top Democrats including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and\u00a0Hochul.",
      "Mamdani's position on Israel\u00a0drew scrutiny over the course of the campaign. He condemned\u00a0the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terrorist attacks\u00a0on Israel, but also criticized the Israeli government's response, calling the war in Gaza a genocide. Israel said his comments were \"shameful.\"",
      "Mamdani says, while he supports Israel's right to exist,\u00a0he will not say it should exist as a Jewish state.",
      "\"I would not recognize any state's right to exist with a system of hierarchy on the basis of race or religion,\" he said in the candidates' second and final debate.",
      "He also said critics have wrongly accused him of more extreme statements.",
      "\"I have never, not once, spoken in support of global jihad. That is not something that I have said. And that continues to be ascribed to me. And frankly, I think much of it has to do with that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election,\" Mamdani said during the last debate.",
      "Mamdani and the NYPD",
      "Mamdani came under withering criticism for his past remarks regarding the NYPD. He previously called for disbanding the Strategic Response Group, which was the same unit that responded to the Midtown office shooting in July. He has since walked that back, saying he was opposed to using that unit to respond to protests.",
      "\"I am not defunding the police,\" Mamdani said\u00a0this summer. \"I am not running to defund the police.\"",
      "In an\u00a0October interview with Fox News, Mamdani again apologized for remarks he made about the NYPD in 2020, when he called the department \"racist\" and a \"threat to public safety\" amid nationwide protests after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.",
      "\"We used to ask officers to focus on serious crimes. Now we're asking them to focus also on the mental health crisis, to focus also on homelessness,\" Mamdani said last month. \"Absolutely I'll apologize to police officers right here. Because this is the apology that I've been sharing with many rank and file officers. And I apologize because of the fact that I'm looking to work with these officers, and I know that these officers, these men and women who serve in the NYPD, they put their lives on the line every single day.\"",
      "Mamdani also recently said he would ask Jessica Tisch to stay on as police commissioner.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 07:00:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country that U.N. experts warn could be sliding \"back toward another deadly war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Department of Homeland Security is planning to terminate Temporary Protected Status for nationals of South Sudan imminently, CBS News has exclusively learned. The change will end more than a decade of protection that allowed thousands of displaced South Sudanese nationals to live and work legally in the United States.",
      "According to DHS officials, the decision by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem came after consultation with the State Department and other federal agencies.",
      "Despite recent warnings from the United Nations and other organizations that South Sudan could actually be slipping back into a state of open warfare, DHS officials pointed to the end of an armed conflict, improved diplomatic relations and South Sudan's expressed commitment to reintegrating any returning nationals, adding that continuing the TPS designation for South Sudan would be \"contrary\" to U.S. interests.",
      "The designation lapsed on November 3, 2025, and a DHS official tells CBS News that a formal notice of termination will be published in the Federal Register later this week, triggering a 60-day grace period for South Sudanese nationals to depart the country or face deportation once their status officially expires in January. DHS estimates that roughly 5,000 South Sudanese nationals are currently living in the United States.",
      "Over the past 14 years, under the program, South Sudanese nationals who could not safely return to their home country due to armed conflict and environmental disaster were shielded from deportation and allowed to work legally in the U.S. The designation dated back to a period of rampant instability that began when the young nation first gained its independence in 2011. Multiple presidential administrations had since extended the program.",
      "South Sudan's TPS designation was most recently renewed for 18 months, from November 4, 2023, to May 3, 2025, by then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, \"due to ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in South Sudan that prevent individuals from safely returning.\" It was then extended automatically for six months, through November 3, after DHS did not complete a required review before a statutory 60-day window passed.",
      "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country still struggling to recover from years of civil war and humanitarian crises. While DHS says conditions have improved, humanitarian groups and regional experts caution that peace remains fragile, with deepening economic distress creating challenges for any safe return.",
      "U.N. says \"all indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war\"",
      "International mediators have reported some progress toward implementing a peace agreement and transitional governance framework, despite violence, corruption and weak state institutions hampering humanitarian access. But the U.S. State Department maintains a\u00a0Level 4 \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for South Sudan, citing persistent armed conflict, crime and kidnapping.",
      "According to the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations, armed clashes among government troops, opposition forces and ethnic militias continue to claim lives and displace civilians.",
      "The United Nations has documented widespread human rights abuses, including the recruitment of child soldiers, sexual violence and arbitrary detentions, and the global body's human rights chief warned as recently as September that the fragile truce could crumble.",
      "\"With fears of a collapse of the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement and a return to widespread violence intensifying, I deeply worry for the plight of civilians in South Sudan,\" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in late September.",
      "More recently, a U.N. commission on human rights in the country warned the U.N. General Assembly at the end of October that \"South Sudan's political transition is falling apart.\"",
      "\"The ceasefire is not holding, political detentions have become a tool of repression, the peace agreement's key provisions are being systematically violated, and the Government forces are using aerial bombardments in civilian areas. All indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war,\" commissioner Barney Afako told the U.N.",
      "The U.N.'s\u00a0World Food Program\u00a0has also warned that ongoing conflict, flooding and food insecurity are worsening humanitarian conditions in the country.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the population \u2014 an estimated 9 million people \u2014 require humanitarian assistance, while 7.7 million face acute food insecurity, according to the Congressional Research Service and the\u00a0U.N. Population Fund.",
      "In the run-up to the official termination, DHS is now urging South Sudanese nationals who choose to depart voluntarily to use the Customs and Border Protection \"CBP Home\" mobile app to report their departure. The app, according to the department, offers a \"safe, secure\" way to self-deport, including a complimentary plane ticket, an exit bonus of $1,000 and potential pathways for future legal immigration to the United States, although DHS has not outlined what those pathways might look like."

    "story": [
      "The Trump factor",
      "He may not have been on the ballot, but President Trump was on the minds of voters in the 2025 elections.",
      "He was a factor for many voters in each of the places where exit polls were conducted: Virginia, New Jersey, New York City and California. And more said their vote in these races was to oppose him, than support him.",
      "These are historically Democrat-leaning places, and more voters here disapproved than approved of his overall job as president. They also found that his administration's actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far.",
      "New York City: Cost of living and bringing needed change",
      "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani won a decisive victory over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on a campaign of affordability, and the cost of living was the most important issue to voters in New York City. Mamdani handily won the majority of voters who picked it. More specifically, he focused on the cost of housing, which seven in 10 voters in New York said was a major problem where they live, and he won among renters, who made up more than half of the electorate.",
      "Voters who made up their minds in the last month of the campaign voted overwhelmingly for Cuomo, but it wasn't enough to make up for the majority of voters who decided on Mamdani before October.",
      "Cuomo led Mamdani among Jewish voters \u2014 most of whom said a candidate's position on Israel was important in their vote.",
      "Mamdani's coalition was led by enormous support among voters under 30 and very liberal voters, but his support extended to all voters under 45 and to those who considered themselves only somewhat liberal, while older voters, as well as moderates and conservatives, voted for Cuomo.",
      "The Republican candidate in the New York City mayoral race, Curtis Sliwa, came in a distant third and didn't even win self-identified Republicans (they voted for Cuomo). Had he dropped out of the race, it might not have made a difference. Though most of Sliwa's supporters said they would have voted for Cuomo, exit polls indicate that in a hypothetical two-way race, Mamdani still would have been victorious.",
      "Mamdani also ran on change, and that was picked as the most important quality in how voters made their decision. A changing electorate was also a hallmark of Mamdani's win \u2014 his strongest support was not just young voters, but also those who were voting in a mayoral race for the first time and those who had moved to New York within the past 10 years.",
      "New Jersey and Virginia: The economy, women voters",
      "Economic issues also loomed large in the Democratic wins in the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia. In New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli won voters who were most concerned about taxes and who said electricity was a major problem for them, but voters who said the most important issue was the economy overall voted for Sherrill. In Virginia, those \"economy\" voters voted for Abigail Spanberger over Winsome Earle-Sears by more than 20 points.",
      "Women voted in big numbers for the women Democratic candidates in Virginia and New Jersey. Sherrill and Spanberger's margins with women were far larger than Kamala Harris' were nationally in 2024.",
      "Independents were key, too. They swung toward Spanberger in Virginia, after Glenn Youngkin won them in 2021. Independents also backed Sherrill in New Jersey.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-arguments/",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 06:00:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court is hearing arguments over whether a federal emergency powers law authorizes President Trump's most sweeping tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to consider Wednesday whether President Trump can unilaterally impose tariffs on nearly every country under a federal emergency powers law, with the justices poised to test a centerpiece of his economic agenda and the limits of presidential powers.",
      "The court fight over Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs marks the first in which the Supreme Court will weigh the legal merits of one of the president's signature policies implemented in his second term.",
      "Three lower courts have concluded that most of the president's tariffs are illegal, and a ruling from the Supreme Court upholding those decisions would deal a blow to Mr. Trump's plans to use tariffs as leverage to push U.S. trading partners to negotiate better trade deals. The president has also claimed that tariffs help to boost domestic manufacturing.",
      "At issue in the case are two sets of duties that Mr. Trump rolled out through a series of executive orders earlier this year. The president has relied on a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose the tariffs.",
      "The first tranche set a baseline rate of 10% on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as well as higher reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries in response to what he said are \"large and persistent\" trade deficits. The second targeted China, Canada and Mexico with tariffs of varying rates for what he asserted was their failure to stop the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S.",
      "In his executive orders, the president declared trade imbalances and the trafficking of drugs across U.S. borders as national emergencies, which unlocked IEEPA's powers. The law authorizes the president to \"regulate \u2026 importation\" to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security, foreign policy or the U.S. economy. Mr. Trump has argued that trade deficits and the failure to curtail the flow of illicit drugs into the country qualify as such a threat.",
      "Presidents have used IEEPA dozens of times over the past nearly 50 years to impose sanctions on foreign actors, but it has never before been used to levy tariffs.",
      "Since Mr. Trump announced the import taxes in February and April \u2014 on what he called \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 the administration has reached trade deals with at least 10 countries and the European Union, and said it is \"actively negotiating\" with other nations.",
      "But after the rollout of the new levies, two sets of small businesses and a group of 12 states filed lawsuits arguing that IEEPA doesn't authorize the president's sweeping action. The first case was brought in Washington, D.C., by a pair of Illinois-based educational toy companies. The others, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, came from a group of five small businesses and Democratic officials from 12 states.",
      "The U.S. district court in Washington and the Court of International Trade separately ruled against the administration, concluding that IEEPA doesn't give the president the authority to impose his global and trafficking-related tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the trade court's decision in cases from the five small businesses and states, ruled 7-4 that many of the president's levies are illegal. The appeals court found that while IEEPA may authorize some tariffs, the law didn't allow for those \"of the magnitude\" of Mr. Trump's.",
      "Still, it allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the sweeping tariffs while the legal battles play out.",
      "Mr. Trump has also continued to rely on IEEPA to impose new levies or tweak existing rates, including raising Canadian tariffs to 35% (though many of its goods are subject to exemptions),\u00a0imposing an additional 40% duty on Brazil and threatening China with an additional 100% duty, though the president has since walked that back. Mr. Trump announced last week following a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would be\u00a0reducing the tariffs on goods imported from China.",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs on an extremely fast timeline, having agreed in September to decide the cases, and could move quickly to issue a ruling.",
      "Trump administration argues for presidential powers",
      "In urging the high court to uphold the duties, the Trump administration has argued that Congress has long given the president broad authority to impose tariffs to address emergencies. IEEPA, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing, is a continuation of that tradition because it gives the president the power to \"regulate \u2026 importation.\"",
      "Sauer also said that the tariffs are an exercise of Mr. Trump's power over national security and foreign affairs, and courts should give deference to his determination that the duties are best suited for addressing national emergencies arising from trade deficits and drug-trafficking.",
      "Invalidating those levies, Sauer wrote, would have \"catastrophic consequences\" for national security, foreign policy and the economy.",
      "\"To the President, these cases present a stark choice: With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump is highly invested in the case, calling it \"one of the most important in the history of the country.\" The president floated attending the arguments in person, but he reversed course Sunday, writing on social media that he did \"not want to distract from the importance of this decision.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u00a0told Fox News on Monday that he will be at the arguments with a \"ringside seat.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Bessent is attending at the president's request.",
      "Businesses warn of economic impact",
      "On the other side, the small businesses warned in court papers that Mr. Trump's tariffs have significant economic consequences. An analysis from the Tax Foundation found the duties will impose $1.7 trillion in new taxes on Americans by 2035, reduce GDP growth by 0.7% per year, and reduce income by 1.1% in 2026.",
      "Neal Katyal, who will argue on behalf of the companies before the Supreme Court, said the Trump administration's interpretation of IEEPA is a \"breathtaking assertion\" of power that requires explicit authorization from Congress. IEEPA, he said, doesn't even mention the word tariff or duty, and no president has understood the law to authorize them.",
      "If the Supreme Court agrees with Mr. Trump that the power to tax is found in IEEPA through the phrase \"regulate \u2026 importation,\" then \"the president, empowered by a supercharged U.S. Code, could tax everything from autos to zoos,\" Katyal wrote in a filing.",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that trade deficits hardly constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat,\" as imbalances have lasted for five decades, and Mr. Trump himself has described them as \"persistent.\"",
      "Additionally, the power to levy taxes and duties rests squarely with Congress, and any delegations of that power have been \"explicit and strictly limited,\" they said. And indeed, there are numerous other statutes in which Congress has delegated its tariffing power \u2014 some of which have been used by Mr. Trump \u2014 though they put constraints on the president.",
      "Testing the boundaries of presidential authority",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's efforts to use IEEPA to impose his sweeping tariffs comes as he has tested the boundaries of his presidential authority, including through his firings of independent agency officials, the withholding of $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress and his efforts to overhaul the executive branch.",
      "Those cases have already been before the Supreme Court, though at earlier stages than the challenges to Mr. Trump's tariffs. In most of those emergency appeals, the conservative justices have allowed the Trump administration to temporarily enforce its policies while proceedings in the lower courts continue.",
      "Like those other cases, the dispute over whether Mr. Trump has the authority to impose duties on nearly every country under IEEPA without Congress could have significant implications for presidential power.",
      "The Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad assertions of executive authority on issues of major political and economic significance when Congress has not spoken clearly, invoking what's called the major questions doctrine to invalidate former President Joe Biden's plan to wipe away more than $400 billion in student loan debt and block an eviction moratorium during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "That legal principle is raised in the battle over his tariffs, though the Trump administration argues that it doesn't apply to matters of national security and foreign policy.",
      "\"Judges lack the institutional competence to determine when foreign affairs pose an unusual and extraordinary threat that requires an emergency response; that is a task for the political Branches,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "But lawyers for the small businesses counter that tariffs are a tax on the American people, and the Constitution has vested the taxing power in Congress.",
      "\"The Framers understood that taxation is a potent power that can destroy the taxed as it fills the sovereign's coffers. The Constitution vests that extraordinary power exclusively in the branch of government considered most responsive to the citizenry: Congress,\" lawyers for the Illinois companies wrote in a filing. \"This Court should not lightly assume that Congress abdicated its core taxing power to permit the President to tax Americans with virtually no limits.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zohran-mamdani-socialist-2026-midterms-means-for-democrats/",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 23:56:39 -0500",
    "summary": "A Democratic Socialists of America leader says New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani offers a \"powerful way forward\" for Democrats \u2014 but some moderates worry he'll hand the GOP \"a pretty potent set of weapons\" in next year's midterms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory on Tuesday in the New York City mayoral race is already fanning the debate about the future of the Democratic Party and what his sudden political stardom could mean for next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"We hope this is demonstrating a very powerful way forward,\" said Ashik Siddique, a national co-chair of the Democratic Socialists of America. \"This election proves that democratic socialist ideas are very popular.\"",
      "Mamdani ran on promises to confront economic inequality and cost-of-living issues, vowing rent freezes for residents of rent-stabilized units, affordable housing construction, free \u2014 and faster \u2014 bus service, free childcare, city-owned grocery stores to address high food costs and tax hikes on the wealthy.",
      "His victory is the biggest win for progressives since Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated 10-term incumbent Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in 2018. But history suggests his success isn't likely to translate to a progressive sweep nationwide.",
      "\"It's very reminiscent of 2018 when you had this superstar, young, telegenic and extremely capable candidate win a primary in New York City and set the world on fire,\" said Matt Bennett, the executive vice president for public affairs for moderate Democratic group Third Way. \"But in the end, the thing that really mattered was that 40 seats were flipped, and Nancy Pelosi got the gavel \u2014 and those seats were flipped by moderates.\"",
      "\"Much ink will be spilled over Mamdani, and he will become a face to the party, but the idea that he will define what it means to be a Democrat, I think, is absurd,\" Bennett said.",
      "Some in the Democratic Party who have been critical of Mamdani rallied behind Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York, who ran as an independent after his defeat by Mamdani in the Democratic primary. Cuomo, the son of liberal icon and former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, was endorsed by the current scandal-ridden New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped his reelection bid, and President Trump.",
      "In the 2024 primary elections, \"mainstream\" Democrats outperformed progressive candidates, winning about two-thirds of the races, according to a study from the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. The study also noted just three House candidates and one Senate candidate who identify as democratic socialists won their elections in 2024.",
      "A CBS News poll conducted last week found that just 22% of Democrats nationwide think the party should move toward socialist positions. A majority \u2014 60% of Democrats nationwide \u2014 said their party's economic positions should reflect a mixture of socialist and capitalist ideas. And 5% said the party should move more toward capitalist positions.",
      "Establishment Democratic leaders have mostly offered tepid endorsements of Mamdani, or none at all, and moderate Democrats have been trying to distance themselves from his proposals.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, was slow to endorse Mamdani, offering his backing to the candidate in late October, only a day before early voting began. Neither of the state's Democratic senators, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, gave their endorsement. Former President Barack Obama called Mamdani the weekend before the election, but he stopped short of offering public support.",
      "Jeffries told CNN in an interview Sunday that he does not view Mamdani as the future of the party and is not concerned about Republicans using him as a \"lightning rod\" against Democrats in the elections next November.",
      "That won't stop Republicans from asserting that Mamdani is the new face of the Democratic Party. They're doing it already. The National Republican Campaign Committee, the House GOP's fundraising arm, has been linking Mamdani to vulnerable Democrats in New York, as well as party leaders.",
      "\"The Democrat Party has surrendered to radical socialist Zohran Mamdani and the far-left mob who are now running the show,\" NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement Tuesday. \"Every House Democrat is foolishly complicit in their party's collapse, and voters will make them pay in 2026.\"",
      "Bennett said Mamdani's win and the Democratic Socialists of America platform gives Republicans \"a pretty potent set of weapons\" to use against Democrats running in Republican strongholds and battleground states or districts. He compared it to Republican attack ads against Democrats during the \"defund the police\" movement which gained prominence after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police.",
      "\"It raises the level of difficulty to flip places from red to blue,\" Bennett said. \"What we have learned, and we especially learned from the 'defund the police' experience, is that silence is deadly. So Democrats cannot simply presume that their reputation, their brand, the fact that they are local in Wisconsin or Michigan or wherever they're running is going to be enough to convince people that they don't share the Mamdani ideas the Republicans suggest that they do.\"",
      "Also unclear: Whether New York Democrats will help or hinder Mamdani as he tries to implement his far-reaching agenda. He'll need authorization from New York state agencies for proposals like free bus service, and Democrats in Albany will need to greenlight some of the tax increases on high earners that he's proposed in order to pay for his plans.",
      "\"While there is some low-hanging fruit, we believe that many initiatives are not viable in their current form,\" J.P. Morgan Asset Management said in a report on Mamdani's platform last month that argued state lawmakers are unlikely to let him hike taxes on corporations and residents who make over $1 million.",
      "Still, Bennett said there are lessons that Democratic candidates can learn from Mamdani, the most important being his \"crystal clear\" focus on affordability.",
      "\"I don't particularly like his ideas, but he articulated them in ways that really resonated and that people could kind of repeat back to him, and that's a very good lesson for Democrats to take,\" he said.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who also describes himself as a democratic socialist, told CBS News' \"The Takeout\": \"If he wins, the message goes all over this country: You can stand up to the oligarchs, we can start electing members of Congress and mayors and governors who stand with the working class.\"",

    "story": [
      "Horse Cave, Kentucky \u2014 The comeback story of the small southern Kentucky town of Horse Cave began far below its streets in the Hidden River Cave, which for decades wasn't the place of wonder it is now, but a waste dump.",
      "\"Everybody was sick of the smell,\" former Horse Cave Mayor Sandra Wilson told CBS News.",
      "Wilson remembers when the cave was part of the sewer system. And yet, surprising as it may seem, her desire to modernize the sewer system's infrastructure and clean up the Hidden River Cave was met with fierce resistance.",
      "\"We had a lot of people who were wary of rising sewer prices,\" Wilson said. \"The goal was to create the sewer system to clean up the mess. Period.\"",
      "While the people in town fought over sewers, David Foster of the American Cave Conservation Association had a solution that involved convincing the people of Horse Cave to enact new sewer fees to pay for the cleanup. That was not an easy sell, and caused arguments and threats inside city leadership.",
      "\"It happened over 40 years,\" Foster said of the process to complete the new system. \"It wasn't an overnight success story.\"",
      "Putting in a modern sewer system in 1989 allowed the town to open Hidden River Cave to visitors. Building the stairs, trails and a museum cost an additional $6 million, which came from grants and donations. The museum opened in 1993, and tourists could start exploring all the way into the cave's domes in 2020.",
      "But the investment paid off. Last year, 30,000 tourists came to the town of about 3,000.",
      "Today, 10 miles of passageways are open to visitors. The most unique stretch of Hidden River Cave is also the shakiest part, a 100-foot-long suspension bridge, the longest underground suspension bridge in the world.",
      "\"We draw people off the interstate \u2014 that is really close by \u2014 to come here. And everybody loves the tour,\" Wilson said.",
      "Completion of the sewer system also allowed modern factories to open in the area. There are factories near Horse Cave that employ a combined 3,000 workers.",
      "Foster says that without \"patience and determination,\" the town's biggest stinker would never have become its biggest treasure.",

      "Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger will defeat Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the Virginia gubernatorial race, CBS News projected Tuesday, marking one of Democrats' first major victories since President Trump's win last year.",
      "Spanberger will be Virginia's first female governor.",
      "Virginia's off-year gubernatorial race tends to serve as a referendum on the president who was elected a year prior \u2014 and historically, the president's party has almost always lost.",
      "National politics were a throughline in this year's race, especially the Trump administration's sweeping federal layoffs and the still-unresolved month-long government shutdown, which has forced most federal workers to go without pay. Both issues are potent in Virginia, which has nearly 150,000 federal civilian jobs and is home to scores of military personnel.",
      "Spanberger, a former CIA officer and congresswoman, positioned herself as an adversary of the Trump administration and sought to link Earle-Sears to Mr. Trump. She frequently tried to capitalize on frustration over federal layoffs and Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Virginia has moved leftward in recent years, driven by shifts in the fast-growing suburbs of Washington, D.C., though Democrats lost ground last year, with Mr. Trump boosting his share of the statewide vote from 44% in 2020 to 46.1% in 2024.",
      "A year later, however, the president's approval rating in Virginia stands at 42%, with 55% disapproving, according to exit poll data \u2014 a possible liability for Republicans.",
      "But the race also follows months of uncertainty for the Democratic Party, which was stung by its 2024 loss and is still riven by disagreements between its moderate and progressive factions on the party's strategy moving forward. Meanwhile, just 34% of U.S. adults hold a favorable view of the party, compared to 41% for the GOP, according to a CBS News poll from last month.",
      "Earle-Sears, a Marine Corps veteran and former state lawmaker, took aim at Spanberger over immigration and the participation of transgender students in school sports.",
      "In recent weeks, the race has been dominated by a scandal in the usually lower-profile Virginia attorney general election, after text messages surfaced showing Democratic nominee Jay Jones used violent and incendiary language toward Republicans. Spanberger condemned the messages, but Earle-Sears pressed her to call for Jones to drop out of the race.",
      "Spanberger campaigned in the closing stretch with high-profile Democrats like former President Barack Obama, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.",
      "Earle-Sears drew on support from Virginia's popular but term-limited incumbent Gov. Glenn Youngkin, whose economic record Earle-Sears has touted.",
      "But the Republican candidate wasn't explicitly endorsed by Mr. Trump, the leader of her party, even though the president gave his \"complete and total endorsement\" to the GOP nominees in Virginia's attorney general race and New Jersey's gubernatorial race. Mr. Trump has offered some support for Earle-Sears \u2014 but not by name.",
      "\"I think the Republican candidate is very good, and I think she should win because the Democrat candidate's a disaster,\" he told reporters two weeks ago, adding, \"I haven't been too much involved in Virginia.\"",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down\u00a0on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding. Some 35 days later, it surpassed the record for longest shutdown on record.",
      "Republicans have rejected Democrats' push to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018 and early 2019, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",

House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",

      "\"It was me and God every night,\" Ron Dailey, 65, told \"CBS Mornings,\" speaking about how he leaned on his faith while stranded in the sprawling mountain range in harsh conditions and without much sustenance.",
      "Dailey had packed for a half-day hunting trip on Oct. 13 in the Sierra National Forest, which is a dense wilderness area in central California near the city of Fresno, CBS News Los Angeles reported. When he didn't return home as planned, Dailey's family contacted the Fresno County Sheriff's Office and triggered a massive search operation aerially and on land. According to the station, the operation eventually stretched across multiple counties and tasked responders with locating the missing hunter in rugged terrain.",
      "Although Dailey's hunting trip was meant to be brief, a wrong turn, a snowstorm and a broken truck left him alone and trapped in the wilderness, where he ultimately survived for about 20 days.",
      "\"I went down this hill, I'm going, 'Oh God, this ain't good,'\" Dailey said of the moment he initially lost his way in the forest. \"So, I turned around and tried to get out. I couldn't get out.\"",
      "Then a winter storm hit that evening. About two feet of snow had fallen on top of his truck and all around him, Dailey recalled. At that point, the hunter thought, \"Oh man, I'm in trouble,\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Then, Dailey's survival instincts kicked in. He had 14 bottles of water and about 900 calories worth of food with him, which he tried to ration for as long as he could. Eventually, the supply ran out, and Dailey said he \"didn't know if rescue was gonna come\" because \"nobody really knew where I was.\"",
      "When he was finally rescued, Dailey said: \"God woke me up at 6:45 Saturday morning. He goes, 'Ron, get your boots on. Let's go walking.'\"",
      "He walked what he thought was about 10 or 12 miles through the wilderness, stopping frequently to sit down because of the altitude. That's when three rescuers appeared.",
      "\"The Christian community just pulled together and kept praying and praying and praying,\" said Dailey. \"They wouldn't let me die. Neither would God.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former Vice President Dick Cheney, a force in Republican politics for over 30 years and one of the most powerful people to hold the second-highest office in the U.S., has died. He was 84.",
      "In\u00a0a statement, Cheney's family said he died Monday night of complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, surrounded by his wife of 61 years, Lynne, daughters Liz and Mary and other family members.",
      "Before becoming vice president in the George W. Bush administration, Cheney served as defense secretary, White House chief of staff and a Wyoming congressman.",
      "In the statement, his family called Cheney \"a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing. We are grateful beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.\"",
      "In 2000, Cheney was asked by Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, to help pick his running mate. In the end, it was Cheney's own name that topped the list. He would, it was believed, provide gravitas and broad Washington experience for the younger Texas governor.",
      "\"He really wanted me to come on board because he thought I could help govern, be part of his team, and that he wanted me involved in everything,\" Cheney told CBS' \"60 Minutes II.\"",
      "He was viewed as one of the most powerful vice presidents in U.S. history; at the same time, he became a lightning rod for those who opposed the war in Iraq and the expansion of presidential powers.",
      "\"Cheney really drastically changed the presidency, the vice president's role and our standing in the international community,\" presidential historian Alexis Coe told CBS News.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Bush called Cheney a \"calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges.\"",
      "\"I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best,\" Bush said. \"He held to his convictions and prioritized the freedom and security of the American people. For those two terms in office, and throughout his remarkable career, Dick Cheney's service always reflected credit on the country he loved.\"",
      "In recent years, Cheney saw his daughter Liz Cheney achieve political prominence as a Wyoming GOP representative in Congress known for her open criticism of President Trump. She lost her position as the top Republican woman in the House over her fight with Mr. Trump about his baseless claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from him. She went on to serve as vice chair of the House select committee investigating the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and continued to warn of the danger that she said Mr. Trump posed to democracy, even campaigning for his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, in 2024.",
      "Dick Cheney cut an ad for his daughter's failed 2022 reelection campaign backing her position, arguing that in U.S. history \"there has never been an individual that was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.\"",
      "Cheney shaped Republican Party politics for a generation, but he cast his final presidential ballot in 2024 for a Democrat. In a statement, he said Mr. Trump \"can never be trusted with power again. As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution.\"",
      "Early life and rise to power",
      "Richard Bruce Cheney was born in 1941 in Lincoln, Nebraska, and grew up in Wyoming. He attended Yale but dropped out after two years and instead finished his college education at the University of Wyoming. Cheney married his high-school sweetheart Lynne, with whom he had two daughters.",
      "He then moved to Washington, D.C., to begin his career, having avoided the draft and the Vietnam War with deferments beginning in early 1966 because it took him six years to finish college, he later testified before Congress at a confirmation hearing.",
      "By age 34, he was White House chief of staff for President Gerald Ford, the youngest person ever to hold the job.",
      "In 1978, he ran for Congress and won the first of six terms in the House, representing Wyoming. In 1989, he was chosen to be secretary of defense in the administration of President George H.W. Bush.",
      "In 1991, he oversaw the U.S. victory in the first Gulf War, when Iraqi forces were driven out of Kuwait. For years afterward, he defended the decision not to invade Baghdad.",
      "\"If we had gone on to Baghdad, if we had sort of accepted the responsibility for occupying the country, governing Iraq, putting a new government in place, running Saddam to ground, I think there would have been significant additional U.S. casualties,\" Cheney said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" in 1992. \"I can't say how many, but the proposition is how many additional American lives is Saddam Hussein worth? And my answer to that question is, not very darn many.\"",
      "In 1995, Cheney became chairman and CEO of Halliburton, the world's largest oil field services company, his first corporate job. His salary and stock options made him a multimillionaire. But in 2000 he left the company to join the Republican ticket.",
      "\"This election is about real choices \u2014 we are talking about the future of our nation,\" Cheney said at a 2000 post-debate rally in Kentucky.",
      "The presidential campaign was bitterly contested and its outcome was undecided on election night, with Florida too close to call, though Bush had a slight lead. Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, asked for recounts in four counties, as Bush sued to stop the recounts. The race was ultimately decided five weeks after the election by a 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court.",
      "A turning point in history",
      "The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States proved to be the defining moment for the new administration \u2014 particularly, it seemed, for Cheney. Even as the U.S. struck al Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan, Cheney warned of a larger web of U.S. enemies, urging military action against Iraq and Saddam Hussein.",
      "\"Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction,\" Cheney told the Veterans of Foreign Wars in 2002.",
      "Baghdad fell only three weeks after the U.S. invasion in 2003. No weapons of mass destruction were ever found, and American forces began a long, deadly occupation.",
      "\"It's hard to explain how important he was, actually, during those Iraq war days,\" Republican strategist Kevin Sheridan told CBS News. \"He was truly central to everything that America did to respond to 9/11. He's obviously received a lot of criticism since for it.\"",
      "Even so, the Bush-Cheney team made national security the centerpiece of the 2004 presidential campaign.",
      "\"If we make the wrong choice, the danger is that we'll get hit again,\" Cheney said at a town hall meeting in Des Moines, Iowa.",
      "The president and Cheney were returned to office in a close election.",
      "But as the situation in Iraq disintegrated and U.S. casualties mounted, public opinion turned against the conflict and the administration.",
      "In November 2006, Democrats won majorities in both houses of Congress, swept in primarily by anti-war sentiment.",
      "To his many detractors, Cheney was a man obsessed with secrecy, the threat of terrorism and strengthening presidential power.",
      "Cheney and Bush ignored the critics.",
      "But in his second term, the president broke with Cheney on the firing of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the offer of talks to North Korea, and the refusal of a pardon for Cheney's former chief of staff, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby. Libby was convicted in 2007 of lying to a grand jury but ultimately pardoned by President Trump in 2018.",
      "At the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama, Cheney appeared in a wheelchair because of a back injury. But the former vice president proved to be as pugnacious as ever in frequent attacks on the new president and his administration. \"I think Barack Obama is a one-term president,\" Cheney said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2010.",
      "Heart transplant brings \"a new day\"",
      "Cheney's cardiovascular health was a problem throughout his life. He suffered a total of five heart attacks, his first at age 37 during his run for Congress.",
      "In 2010, after his fifth, doctors implanted a battery-powered device to help his heart pump blood throughout his body. That bought Cheney time while he awaited a heart transplant, which he received in 2012.",
      "\"You wake up every morning with a smile on your face,\" he told 60 Minutes\u00a0in 2013, \"because you've got a new day you never expected to have.\"",

    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the agency may need to close \"certain parts\" of the nation's airspace if the shutdown drags on.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation may need to close \"certain parts of the airspace\" if the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on record continues into next week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" Duffy said at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",
      "He added, \"We will restrict the airspace when we feel it's not safe.\"",
      "Throughout the 35-day federal shutdown, set to become the longest in U.S. history, Duffy has maintained that commercial air travel remains safe. The tradeoff is that passengers are experiencing more flight delays as officials slow flight traffic based on staffing levels to ensure that the national airspace remains well-monitored, Duffy\u00a0has said at earlier press conferences.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while an additional 4,700 trips were delayed on Monday, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "Duffy said on social media on Wednesday that 46% of the previous day's flight delays were due to staffing issues in air traffic control towers. Ordinarily, personnel issues account for roughly 5% of such delays, according to aviation data.",
      "\"Draconian steps\"?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights following the\u00a09/11 terror attacks for national security reasons, while hurricanes and other weather emergencies can also lead to flight restrictions. But closing parts of the nation's airspace because of staffing issues would be unprecedented, according to aviation industry experts.",
      "\"In this particular instance, Duffy is talking about staffing. He knows the strain and stress this is taking on air traffic controllers,\" Sheldon Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and an expert on aviation security, told CBS News.",
      "Closing even a portion of the nation's vast airspace would be a major step and likely impact travel nationwide, he added. The system operates on a so-called hub-and-spoke model in which passengers using regional airports can connect with major airports to travel around the U.S.",
      "If the airspace around New York were to close, for example, it could affect passengers in multiple cities, according to Jacobson.",
      "\"For us to take such draconian steps to shut it down in sectors of the country would be unprecedented,\" he said. \"If you shut down the New York area, you shut down a lot of the country because of the interconnectivity of the hub-and-spoke system.\"",
      "More controllers calling in sick",
      "With air traffic controllers working without pay during the shutdown, more than usual are calling in sick, Duffy has said. He has said he is discouraging them from taking on side gigs like delivering for Uber or DoorDash to make ends meet during the funding lapse, given the level of focus that their job requires.",
      "\"The longer this goes on, every day, these hardworking Americans have bills they have to pay, and they're being forced to make decisions and choices,\" Duffy said Tuesday. \"As every day goes by, I think the problem is going to only get worse. Not better.\"",
      "At an Oct. 28 news conference at LaGuardia Airport in New York, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels emphasized that his organization's members are under mounting financial pressures.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "The U.S. Travel Association on Monday urged congressional leaders to end the shutdown, which the industry trade group said could disrupt passengers during the busy Thanksgiving holiday. In 2024, 20 million passengers took to the skies over that week.",
      "\"A shutdown places extraordinary strain on federal personnel who are essential to keeping America moving \u2014 from Transportation Security Administration officers to air traffic controllers, who are forced to work without pay,\" the group said in a Nov. 3 letter. \"When staffing shortages worsen, airport wait times grow longer and flight delays and cancellations become more frequent, threatening to derail family travel plans across the country.\"",

Yet the move still leaves participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the dark on exactly when they will get the funds.",
      "In a\u00a0declaration\u00a0submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said $4.6 billion in contingency USDA funds will be used to cover 50% of SNAP recipients' benefits.",
      "However, the USDA declaration said that procedural changes U.S. states must make in order to issue partial benefits could take \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months.\" A spokesperson for the USDA referred CBS News to a social media\u00a0post\u00a0from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, which also says benefits could take several weeks to arrive.",
      "It's unclear how long it will take some states to issue SNAP payments since this is an unprecedented situation, said Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. The timing will depend on how fast states can adjust to issue partial SNAP benefits and relay that information to EBT vendors, she added.",

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified at a press conference later in the day that Mr. Trump was referring to future SNAP payments.",
      "\"He does not want to have to keep tapping into an emergency fund and depleting it in the case of a catastrophe in this country,\" she said.",
      "With questions continuing to swirl around the SNAP program, attention has turned to how this uncertainty directly affects people on food stamps. CBS News spoke with three people about how losing access to federal food aid could affect them. They reside in states that have committed to sending emergency funds to local food banks to assist families enrolled in SNAP.",

      "Buffalo, New York, resident Shatika Griffin, 45, said she relies on both SNAP and the Women, Infants and Children program,\u00a0to support herself and seven children, including an 11-year-old son who is autistic.",
      "\"I'm a single mom, so it's very frightening,\" Griffin said of missing out on federal nutrition assistance. \"All the kids know is, 'I'm hungry.'\"",
      "Griffin said she typically uses the $1,100 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to pay for food staples she can stretch out for the month, such as spaghetti and canned goods. Without the money, she plans to turn to a local food bank.",

      "In May of 2024, however, a hit-and-run accident required multiple surgeries and left the 64-year-old Lennox unable to work. Without a stable source of income, Lennox said she relies on SNAP, disability and Social Security retirement benefits to pay the bills. She plans to return to work as soon as she's physically capable, saying she needs a job to help cover her medical expenses.",
      "\"Because it was a hit-and-run, I have all these medical bills to pay,\" she said.",

      "After learning that SNAP funding was under threat because of the shutdown, Lennox said she pulled back on buying food by conserving the remaining food stamps on her electronic benefits card. She currently has $240 in food stamp payments, but plans on visiting a local food bank to make ends meet.",

    "summary": "Senators are discussing a deal that would fund the government alongside long-term appropriations bills in exchange for a vote on extending health care tax credits.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The contours of a potential deal to reopen the government began to emerge on Tuesday as the shutdown was poised to become the longest in history, with senators discussing an agreement that would fund the government alongside long-term appropriations bills in exchange for a vote on extending health insurance tax credits that Democrats have demanded.",
      "A bipartisan group of senators has been engaged in conversations in recent days as lawmakers search for an off-ramp in the shutdown fight. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday morning that he's hopeful the bipartisan group is close to a solution, while acknowledging the \"cross-pressures that everybody's feeling\" are \"great.\"",
      "Republicans argue that Democrats are waiting until after Tuesday's elections to back down, claiming they don't want to discourage their base from turning out to vote. A 14th vote on advancing the GOP-backed continuing resolution failed on Tuesday, with no new Democrats crossing the aisle.",
      "Senate Democrats were tight-lipped about a potential deal after a lengthy lunch meeting at the Capitol. \"We had a very good caucus, and we're exploring all the options,\" Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, told reporters that he's \"pretty confident\" the shutdown will end this week: \"I will tell you there's enough Democrats that I'm friends with that were willing to vote last week, and they were assured that Schumer would let them vote the way they need to this week.\"",
      "The bipartisan conversations on Capitol Hill revolve around an effort to move forward on a so-called \"minibus,\" or a package of full-year appropriations bills, in addition to the continuing resolution. Proponents of the plan say that approving the package would demonstrate Republicans' willingness to work on the long-term funding process on a bipartisan basis.",
      "The minibus would include three separate bills. One would fund military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The second would include funding for the legislative branch, and the third would fund the FDA and the Department of Agriculture. Thune told reporters that the continuing resolution to reopen the government could \"ride\" on the appropriations package.",
      "Sen. Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican and appropriator, told reporters on Tuesday that she made calls on the issue through the weekend. She said she's hopeful that a package of appropriations bills can be part of what ends the stalemate.",
      "\"The reason we're in this position is that we have not passed appropriations bills,\" Britt said. \"So beginning to break the logjam through doing that, I think, would be incredibly effective.\"",
      "Still, Republicans need to win over at least five more Democrats to reopen the government with a short-term measure. Republicans have said they are willing to guarantee a vote on extending health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act in exchange for Democrats' votes, an offer that has been on the table for weeks. Some GOP senators think enough Democrats may be now willing to \"take yes for an answer,\" as Thune puts it.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican who is involved in the talks, outlined the thinking to reporters Tuesday. He said that the appropriations package might entice Democrats to \"vote for something other than just simply a continuing resolution\" while providing \"a path forward\" beyond a vote on the health care tax credits.",
      "Republicans have emphasized a return to regular order in this year's appropriations process and have worked to pass all 12 full-year funding bills, as opposed to a massive year-end funding bill. Appropriators are still aiming to accomplish that goal and avoid a year-long continuing resolution or an omnibus package.",
      "But the continuing resolution would only fund the government until Nov. 21, giving appropriators little time to finish full-year funding. Thune has acknowledged that the deadline must be pushed back, though the exact timing remains up in the air.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top appropriator in the upper chamber, advocated on Monday for a December date. Some lawmakers have argued that a December deadline would increase the chances of resolving the funding fight through individual bills while avoiding a full-year stopgap measure.",
      "But House Speaker Mike Johnson ruled out a December continuing resolution on Tuesday morning, saying \"too many people have concerns\" about a pre-holiday deadline that often results in massive omnibus legislation to fund the government. Thune said later in the day that the date is still being discussed, noting that the expectation is that lawmakers will fund the government through the normal appropriations process. He said nobody wants a year-long continuing resolution, which would extend funding at current levels.",
      "Generally, senators said the talks about an off-ramp were more productive, though they were slim on the details. Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat who's been involved in the conversations, said it was a \"sensitive time\" in the talks.",
      "Collins told reporters Monday that \"we are finally making progress\" in the bipartisan conversations, saying she was \"cautiously hopeful\" that the shutdown will be resolved by the end of the week. On Tuesday, she said \"the talks are more productive because they're more specific.\"",
      "Thune said he's hopeful that \"we'll make some progress\" this week. But any one senator could opt to slow down the process, potentially pushing the impasse into next week.",
      "Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House clarified Tuesday that the Trump administration is complying with a federal court order that requires it to tap into a contingency fund to provide food benefits to tens of millions of Americans after President Trump said the aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will go out only when Democrats vote to end the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "The reassurance from the White House came after the president wrote in a\u00a0post on Truth Social\u00a0that SNAP benefits \"will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comment raised questions as to whether the administration would abide by a Rhode Island judge's order to use reserve funds to issue federal food benefits to Americans enrolled in SNAP. Administration lawyers\u00a0told the court\u00a0Monday that it would tap into the contingency pot to issue reduced food stamp payments for November. The Justice Department said in a filing that the Department of Agriculture would provide states with information necessary for calculating the benefits due to each eligible household, which would allow states to then begin disbursements.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said on X that her agency sent that guidance to states Tuesday morning, but warned it would be a \"cumbersome process\" that could result in a weeks-long delay in food stamp payments going out recipients.",
      "\"If the government opens, families get their FULL benefit much more quickly,\" she wrote.",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's comments by CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration is \"fully complying\" with the court's order, but stressed that \"it's going to take some time\" for recipients to receive the payments.",
      "\"We are digging into a contingency fund that is supposed to be for emergencies, catastrophes, for war, and the president does not want to have to tap into this fund in the future,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt said that in order for beneficiaries to receive their full benefits, Democrats need to vote to fund federal agencies and end the shutdown. Administration officials have said fully covering those allotments for November would require roughly $9 billion, but there is only about $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover this month's benefit payments.",
      "\"Democrats are holding it up and making it difficult for the administration to get those payments out the door,\" she said.",
      "The government shutdown entered its 35th day Tuesday and is on track to become the longest in U.S. history later in the day, surpassing the lapse in federal funding that occurred during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to purchase food each month. The program is funded by the federal government and administered by states, which distribute the nutrition assistance to eligible participants. But the Department of Agriculture said late last month that the food aid would not go out to recipients on Nov. 1 because \"the well has run dry\" amid the government shutdown.",
      "The notice followed the Trump administration's decision not to use roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep the benefits flowing to Americans who rely on SNAP for November. The Department of Agriculture told states in a memo last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to cover regular benefits.\"",
      "Ahead of the cutoff of food benefits at the start of the month, a group of 25 states and the District of Columbia, and a coalition of municipalities and nonprofit organizations,\u00a0filed two different lawsuits claiming the administration's decision to halt food stamp payments was illegal. They sought court orders requiring the Department of Agriculture to use the contingency fund for this month's benefits.",
      "In one of the cases, U.S. District Judge John McConnell on Friday ordered the Trump administration to dip into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP payments caused by the shutdown. The judge, who sits in Rhode Island, gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the money.",
      "In its filing with McConnell submitted Monday, the Justice Department said the Agriculture Department would comply with his order and \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds today\" by providing state agencies with information about reduced SNAP payments.",
      "Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said in a declaration that the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\" He told the court there is roughly $4.6 billion in the reserve for the November payments, which would be used to cover half of eligible households' allotments.",
      "But he warned the aid would likely not go out immediately because of possible \"payment errors and significant delays\" due to variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "Lawyers for the nonprofits and municipalities have\u00a0asked McConnell to issue a new order compelling the Trump administration to provide the full SNAP benefits.",

      "A Customs and Border Patrol Agent testified in federal court on Tuesday that a sandwich \"exploded all over him\" after a D.C. man threw a sub-style sandwich at him during an expletive-filled rant in protest of President Trump's federal policing crackdown and National Guard deployment in the nation's capital this summer.",
      "Sean Dunn, who was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault charges, has become a symbol of resistance against Mr. Trump's D.C. policing policies, sat in a crowded courtroom as spectators, jury members, and even witnesses attempted to keep a straight face during the first day of his criminal trial.",
      "\"He did it, he threw the sandwich,\" Dunn's attorney Julia Gatto said in her opening statement to a D.C. jury, adding their client has \"very strong feelings\" about the Trump administration's federal takeover of D.C.",
      "Gatto called the viral sub-toss a \"harmless gesture that did not, could not, cause injury.\"",
      "Customs and Border Patrol Agent Gregory Lairmore, who was hit with the footlong sub, testified Tuesday about his experience dealing with Dunn, who can be seen in video of the incident yelling at the agent and other officers in his vicinity before throwing the wrapped sandwich at the officer's chest. Dunn attempted to flee on foot before being apprehended, documents and video of the incident shows.",
      "According to charging documents, Dunn yelled, \"F*** you! You f***ing fascists! Why are you here? I don't want you in my city,\" before crossing the street. He later returned and threw the sandwich.",
      "Lairmore, who says he caught most of Dunn's ire before catching the sandwich in his ballistic vest, saying at one point Dunn was \"red-faced\" and \"enraged\" by the police presence at a crowded intersection in Northwest Washington, D.C.",
      "To laughs in the room, Lairmore walked the jury through the \"baseball pitch\" of a sub throw, as another witness put it.",
      "Lairmore said he \"could feel it through his ballistic vest\" and it \"exploded all over\" him after the Subway stack hit him. He said he \"could smell the onions and mustard\" on his uniform, and even had an onion string hanging by his police radio later that night. The fast-food mustard, he said, stained his shirt.",
      "Dunn's attorneys later pressed Lairmore on two gag gifts that his coworkers bought him after the incident, including a plush submarine sandwich and a \"felony footlong\" patch that Lairmore said he put on his lunchbox.",
      "They also pressed Lairmore on why there are no evidentiary photos of stains on his shirt or of the sandwich after it was thrown, only a video posted to social media platform Instagram from a bystander showing the sandwich mostly intact. Lairmore said the Metropolitan Police Department in D.C. took over the investigation after Dunn was detained, and Lairmore said the sandwich appeared at least \"bent and out of shape\" in its wrapper.",
      "Federal prosecutors failed to secure a felony indictment\u00a0from a grand jury in Washington in the immediate aftermath of the incident, and instead charged Dunn with a federal misdemeanor assault charge for allegedly assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating and interfering with a federal officer.",
      "After his arrest, Dunn was fired from his job as a paralegal in the Justice Department. According to a Justice Department source, Dunn worked at the Office of International Affairs within the department's Criminal Division as a paralegal.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla shareholders are voting this week on whether to award CEO Elon Musk a new pay package\u00a0potentially worth up to $1 trillion over a decade, with some prominent investors in the electric car maker criticizing the compensation plan.",
      "Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which holds a stake in Tesla, on Tuesday said it would vote against the pay package.",
      "\"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution and lack of mitigation of key person risk consistent with our views on executive compensation,\" said Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the country's government pension fund.",
      "The fund has a 1.16% stake in Tesla, the sixth-largest holding among institutional investors.",
      "Another investor, Baron Capital Management, said Monday that it would vote in favor of the package.",
      "Musk \"has built one of the most important companies in the world,\" wrote Ron Baron, founder of the asset management firm. \"He's redefining transportation, energy and humanoid robotics and creating lasting value for shareholders while doing it. His interests are completely aligned with investors.\"",
      "Musk is the world's richest person, with Bloomberg\u00a0estimating his wealth at $477 billion.",
      "Tesla's board of directors introduced the\u00a0proposed pay package in early September. Musk, who controls nearly 16% of Tesla's outstanding shares, would also receive more voting power under the plan. In a Sept. 5 regulatory\u00a0filing, the board described the proposed compensation package as an \"ambitious plan to retain and incentivize Mr. Musk through the issuance of a highly customized, performance-based restricted stock award.\"",
      "Tesla would be required to hit certain financial and operational milestones for Musk to earn the full pay package. Those include the company reaching a market capitalization of at least $8.5 trillion; delivering 20 million vehicles; producing 1 million self-driving \"robotaxis\"; and manufacturing 1 million of the company's humanoid robots, dubbed Optimus, which are currently under development.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairperson of the Tesla board, warned investors last week that Musk could leave the company if shareholders reject the enhanced pay proposal.",
      "\"If we fail to foster an environment that motivates Elon to achieve great things through an equitable pay-for-performance plan, we run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision, which have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns,\" Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders posted on social media.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 09:00:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein provided the Justice Department with \"precise and detailed\" information about 20 alleged co-conspirators, House Democrats say.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, is seeking documents from the Justice Department on its move earlier this year to end the investigation into alleged co-conspirators of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"I write to demand an explanation for why DOJ has abandoned the women and girls abused by Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and their co-conspirators, fired or cut off career prosecutors from the case, and ceased its investigation into one of the largest sex trafficking rings in history,\" Raskin wrote in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, which was first obtained by CBS News.",
      "The demand comes amid relentless bipartisan interest in the investigation, which has dogged the Justice Department's top officials as they've sought to put the matter to rest. Some in the Trump administration, including Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, promised major revelations into the Epstein matter before taking office, only to indicate later that the case was closed.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on Raskin's letter and will update this story with any response.",
      "In the letter, Raskin said almost 50 survivors provided information to prosecutors and FBI agents as part of the investigation that ultimately led to the indictments of Epstein in 2019 and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2020. Raskin said the information the survivors provided was \"precise and detailed.\"",
      "\"They described how Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and their co-conspirators orchestrated a sophisticated and clandestine sex trafficking conspiracy that trafficked them to at least 20 men,\" Raskin said. \"These survivors shared with DOJ and FBI the specific identities of many of these co-conspirators, how this operation was structured and financed, and which individuals facilitated these crimes.\"",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York was running an active investigation into Epstein and Maxwell's co-conspirators until January 2025, when prosecutors were directed to transfer the Epstein case files to the Justice Department's headquarters, in what Raskin said was \"a sudden and dramatic shift in the posture of the investigation.\" Since then, \"the investigation into co-conspirators has inexplicably ceased,\" he said, citing information provided to the Judiciary Committee by attorneys who represent Epstein survivors.",
      "Then in July, the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review, which it said found no \"client list\" among the evidence collected by investigators. It also \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate any investigation against uncharged third parties.\" Bondi suggested during a Fox News interview in February that a \"client list\" was sitting on her desk awaiting her review.",
      "\"DOJ and FBI's failure to investigate this conduct is a betrayal of the more than 1,000 survivors of this multi-billion-dollar international sex trafficking ring,\" Raskin wrote. \"As these survivors made clear to DOJ and FBI, Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell did not act alone.\"",
      "Raskin said many of the women spoke with prosecutors and agents, and the interviews were summarized in 302 forms, a document used by the FBI to memorialize information that may later come up in courtroom testimony. Along with the women, Raskin said federal law enforcement agents who worked on the case understood that the investigation was continuing up until January. In Supreme Court filings, Raskin pointed out, the government said the pursuit of Epstein's co-conspirators was ongoing during the Biden administration.",
      "Raskin said the committee is considering reforms that would clarify prosecutors' responsibility to communicate with crime survivors before investigations are closed. And he accused Patel of having \"repeatedly impugned the credibility of the Epstein survivors\" at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in September by suggesting that the information provided by the survivors was not credible.",
      "During the hearing, Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has led an effort to force a vote in the House on releasing the Epstein files, pointed to 20 alleged co-conspirators.",
      "\"According to victims who cooperated with the FBI in that investigation, these documents in FBI possession, your possession, detail at least 20 men, including Mr. Jes Staley, CEO of Barclays Bank,\" Massie said, referring to a banker who left Barclays in 2021 amid scrutiny over his ties to Epstein. Staley, who worked with Epstein for years as a top official at J.P. Morgan, has said they had a \"close professional relationship.\" Staley has denied wrongdoing and said he regrets befriending Epstein.",
      "Massie said other high-profile figures were among those named by Epstein's victims.",
      "\"That list also includes at least 19 other individuals \u2014 one Hollywood producer worth a few hundred million dollars, one royal prince, one high-profile individual in the music industry, one very prominent banker, one high-profile government official, one high-profile former politician, one owner of a car company in Italy, one rockstar, one magician, at least six billionaires, including a billionaire from Canada,\" Massie said.",
      "Massie asked Patel if the FBI had launched any investigations into the individuals and whether he'd seen the 302 documents. Patel responded that he has asked FBI agents to \"review the entirety of the Epstein files and bring forth any credible information.\" He said \"any investigations that arise from any credible investigation will be brought,\" but he added that there have been \"no new materials brought to me launching a new indictment.\"",
      "Asked whether he was asserting that the victims' statements weren't credible, Patel said, \"It's not my assertion, sir, it's the assertion of two different United States attorneys' offices from three separate administrations who investigated those same materials in live time.\"",
      "Raskin said Patel's explanation, along with a later exchange with Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, was not good enough. He wrote in his letter that he is seeking \"an accounting\" of the steps the Justice Department has taken to review the case this year, relevant summaries or reports generated as part of that review and documents related to staffing for Epstein investigative matters.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has inexplicably killed this investigation,\" Raskin said.",

    "story": [
      "Tokyo - Japan's Defense Ministry sent troops on Wednesday to the northern prefecture of Akita to help contain a surge of bear attacks that have horrified residents in the mountainous region.",
      "Bears have shown up near schools, train stations, supermarkets and even a hot springs resort, with attacks by the animals reported almost daily across Japan, mostly in the north.",
      "Since April, more than 100 people have been injured and at least 12 killed in bear attacks across Japan, according to Environment Ministry statistics at the end of October. That is the highest number of people killed by the animals in the country in one fiscal year since 2006, when the ministry started compiling the statistics.",
      "\"Every day, bears intrude into residential areas in the region and their impact is expanding,\" Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Fumitoshi Sato told reporters. \"Responses to the bear problem are an urgent matter.\"",
      "The Defense Ministry and Akita prefecture signed an agreement on the troop dispatch on Wednesday afternoon, allowing soldiers to set box traps with food inside, transport local hunters and help with the disposal of dead bears. The soldiers will not use firearms to cull bears, officials said.",
      "Akita Gov. Kenta Suzuki said local authorities were getting \"desperate\" due to a lack of manpower amid daily reports of bear attacks.",
      "Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said Tuesday the bear mission aims to help secure people's daily lives, but that Self Defense Force service members' primary mission is national defense and they cannot provide unlimited support for the bear response. The Japanese SDF is already understaffed.",
      "So far, the ministry has not received other requests for troop assistance over the bear issue, he said.",
      "In Akita prefecture, which has a population of about 880,000, bears have attacked more than 50 people since May, killing at least four, according to the local government. Experts say 70\uff05 of the bear attacks have occurred in residential areas.",
      "An elderly woman who went mushroom-hunting in the forest was found dead in an apparent bear attack over the weekend in Yuzawa City in the prefecture. Another elderly woman in Akita city encountered a bear while working on a farm and was killed in late October. And a newspaper delivery man was attacked by a bear and suffered an injury in Akita city on Tuesday.",
      "Experts say Japan's aging and declining population in rural areas are among the reasons for the growing bear problem in recent years.",
      "Abandoned neighborhoods and farmland with persimmon or chestnut trees often attract bears to residential areas. Once bears find food and acquire a taste, they keep coming back, experts say.",
      "Local hunters are also aging and not used to bear hunting. Experts say police and other authorities should be trained as \"government hunters\" to help cull the animals.",
      "The government set up a taskforce last week to create an official bear response by mid-November. Officials are considering bear population surveys, the use of communication devices to issue bear warnings and revisions to hunting rules. They also say experts should be trained in hunting and ecology.",
      "The lack of preventive measures in the depopulated and aging northern regions have also led to an increase in the populations of brown bears and Asiatic black bears, the ministry said.",

    "story": [
      "Australian convicted murderer Erin Patterson alleges a \"substantial miscarriage of justice\" took place when she was convicted of killing three people with toxic mushrooms, court documents made public on Wednesday showed.",
      "Patterson, 51, was handed life in prison with parole this year for serving a beef Wellington laced with poisonous fungi to her estranged husband's parents, aunt and uncle during a lunch at her home in 2023, killing three of them.",
      "Local media, including national broadcaster ABC and the Sydney Morning Herald, reported Monday that Patterson's bid to appeal her guilty verdicts had been lodged and accepted by the Court of Appeal.",
      "The state of Victoria's Court of Appeal said Wednesday, however, that while her appeal had been lodged, it had not yet been accepted.",
      "In a document outlining the grounds for her appeal, Patterson's lawyer alleged several counts of \"substantial miscarriage of justice\" took place during her trial, which sparked a global media frenzy.",
      "They said a \"fundamental irregularity\" had taken place while the jury was sequestered that \"fatally undermined the integrity of the verdicts,\" without giving further details.",
      "But local media, citing the court, said the jurors were put up in the same hotel as police and prosecutors for most of their deliberations, according to the Reuters news service.",
      "Patterson's lawyer also accused the prosecution of an \"unfair and oppressive\" cross-examination during the trial.",
      "And her lawyer said evidence submitted and accepted by the judge wasn't relevant to her case while other evidence wasn't admitted but should have been.",
      "She also requested that she not be physically present in court should an oral hearing into her case go ahead.",
      "Patterson was sentenced in September and a judge said she would be eligible for parole after 33 years.",
      "The prosecution has since appealed what it called a \"manifestly inadequate\" sentence.",
      "Throughout a trial lasting more than two months, Patterson maintained the beef-and-pastry dish shle served was accidentally poisoned with death cap mushrooms -- the world's most lethal fungus.",
      "But a 12-person jury found Patterson guilty in July of murdering her husband Simon's parents, Don and Gail Patterson, as well as his aunt Heather Wilkinson, at her home in Leongatha, in the state of Victoria.",
      "She was also found guilty of attempting to murder Ian, Heather's husband.",

      "Dating back to early September, the Trump administration has reported well over a dozen such strikes in the waters of the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean off South America on what it alleges are drug vessels. The strikes have killed more than 50 people.",
      "Outside of the unclassified videos released by the Defense Department, the U.S. has provided no details on the boats that were struck or about the people aboard.",
      "The White House says they are part of an effort to cripple the operations of drug cartels. Some lawmakers have criticized the strikes, saying the White House has not provided enough evidence the boats were smuggling drugs, and with some insisting the president needs congressional approval to carry out the strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump on Oct. 23 told reporters, \"Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead.\"",
      "Several of the strikes have occurred off the coast of Venezuela, as Mr. Trump has been vocal in his criticism of controversial Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0and amid a broader buildup of U.S. military assets in the Caribbean.",

    "story": [
      "The remains of a hostage in Gaza have been turned over and are now in Israel, the Israeli military said Tuesday, in the latest sign of progress under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces later confirmed the remains belonged to Itay Chen, the last Israeli American hostage held in Gaza. Chen died during battle at Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7, 2023, and his body was taken to Gaza. He was 19 years old, the IDF said.",
      "Chen is survived by his parents and two brothers.",
      "With the IDF's confirmation, Hamas has returned the remains of 21 hostages to Israel under the ceasefire that began Oct. 10. The remains of seven others are still in Gaza. The\u00a0process of returning the bodies\u00a0of the last remaining hostages, as called for under the U.S. peace plan, has progressed slowly, with Hamas releasing just one or two bodies every few days.",
      "Hamas says it has\u00a0not been able to reach all of the remains\u00a0because they are buried under rubble of buildings destroyed by Israel's two-year offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, the military wing of Hamas said it had recovered the body of an Israeli soldier in Gaza and intended to hand over the remains. Israel's statement did not indicate whether the remains were of a soldier.",
      "Israel has pushed to speed up the returns and, in certain cases, has said the remains were not those of hostages. Israel's government and the families of the hostages have accused Hamas of dragging its feet, threatening to resume military operations or withhold humanitarian aid if all of the remains are not returned.",
      "Hamas has said the work is complicated by widespread devastation.",
      "For each Israeli hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians. So far, the bodies of 270 Palestinians have been handed over under the current ceasefire. Fewer than half have been identified. Forensic work is complicated by a lack of DNA testing kits in Gaza. The Hamas-run Health Ministry posts photos of the remains online, in the hope that families will recognize them.",
      "The war was triggered by the Hamas-led terror attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage.",
      "Israel responded with a sweeping military offensive that has killed more than 68,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health there, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.",
      "Israel, which has denied accusations by a United Nations commission of inquiry and others of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the ministry's figures without providing a contradicting toll.",
      "The deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas was winding down due to the ceasefire, but\u00a0attacks briefly resumed last month\u00a0after Israel accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire.",

      "Thirteen suspected drug cartel members died Monday in a shootout with authorities in the troubled Mexican state of Sinaloa, officials said.",
      "Another four suspects were arrested and nine people kidnapped by the gang were freed following the clash in Guasave, a municipality in the northwestern state, Security Secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch said in a social media post.",
      "He said security personnel carrying out a patrol were attacked by gunmen hiding under a bridge, prompting officers to respond.",
      "After the firefight, the law enforcement officers also seized seven vehicles, high-powered weapons and tactical equipment, Garcia Harfuch said.",
      "Sinaloa has been rocked for more than a year by a conflict between factions of a powerful local cartel. The violence has left at least 1,700 people dead, 57 of them minors, and nearly 2,000 missing.",
      "The cartel's internal war began after the capture of Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the group's historical leader, who was betrayed and taken to the United States in July 2024 by a son of his former partner, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman.",
      "Following their arrests and Zambada's allegations of kidnapping,\u00a0horrific fighting erupted\u00a0in Mexico between a cartel faction loyal to him and another tied to the \"Chapitos,\" Guzm\u00e1n's sons.",
      "The Chapitos have used corkscrews and electrocution to\u00a0torture their rivals\u00a0while some of their victims were \"fed dead or alive to tigers,\" according to an indictment released by the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "In recent months, bodies have appeared across Sinaloa, often left slung out on the streets or in cars with either\u00a0sombreros on their heads\u00a0or pizza slices or boxes pegged onto them with knives. The pizzas and sombreros have become informal symbols for the warring cartel factions, underscoring the brutality of their warfare.",

    "summary": "Chinese and Thai authorities have tried to crack down on violent criminal gangs running vast fraud operations in Myanmar's borderlands.",
    "story": [
      "China sentenced five people to death on Tuesday for their involvement in a violent criminal gang with fraud operations in Myanmar's Kokang region along the border, state media reported.",
      "Scam compounds have flourished in Myanmar's lawless borderlands, staffed by foreigners \u2014   many of them Chinese \u2014   who often say they were trafficked and forced to swindle people online, part of a multibillion-dollar illicit industry.",
      "Beijing has stepped up cooperation with Southeast Asian nations in recent months to crack down on the compounds, and thousands of people have been repatriated to China.",
      "The crimes of the five people sentenced Tuesday had led to the \"deaths of six Chinese nationals, one Chinese national's suicide and injuries to several others,\" official news agency Xinhua said, citing a court in the southern city of Shenzhen.",
      "\"The criminals were found to have built 41 compounds in the Kokang region,\" said Xinhua, adding that their activities included \"telecom fraud, operating gambling dens, intentional homicide, organizing and coercing prostitution (and) organizing others to illegally cross national borders.\"",
      "The Shenzhen court also handed two other defendants death sentences with two-year reprieves \u2014 a verdict that often results in life imprisonment.",
      "Five defendants were given life imprisonment, while sentences ranging from 3 to 20 years were given to nine others.",
      "In late September, a Chinese court issued death sentences to 16 members of a family-run gang with operations in Kokang \u2014 five with two-year reprieves.",
      "A growing, illegal international business",
      "The United Nations warned that Chinese and Southeast Asian gangs are raking in tens of billions of dollars a year through cyber scam centers.",
      "Sprawling compounds where internet tricksters target people with romance and business cons have thrived along Myanmar's loosely governed border during its civil war, which was sparked by a 2021 coup.",
      "While Myanmar's border region has been a hotbed of the illegal activity, the industry has spread to South America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and some Pacific Islands, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.",
      "A CBS News investigation just last year revealed the massive fraud operations targeting unsuspecting Americans from scam centers in Ghana, where young Ghanaians are lured into potentially lucrative lives of cyber fraud, but quickly become tools of transnational criminal syndicates that work in what's become a billion-dollar industry.",
      "The U.N. estimates that hundreds of thousands of people are working in scam centers globally, and the flourishing centers in Myanmar have drawn many workers from Southeast Asia as well as China.",
      "The Thai prime minister announced in late October that India would repatriate 500 of its citizens from Thailand after a crackdown on a Myanmar scam hub led to workers fleeing over the border.",
      "One of the most notorious hubs \u2014 KK Park \u2014   was roiled by apparent raids in late October, with hundreds of workers fleeing over the frontier river to the Thai town of Mae Sot.",
      "The upheaval followed an AFP investigation which this month revealed rapid construction at border scam centers, despite a much-publicized crackdown in February.",
      "More than 1,500 people from 28 countries crossed into Thailand during the raids on the KK Park facility, according to the administration of the Thai border province of Tak.",
      "\"Nearly 500 Indians are at Mae Sot,\" Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters on Oct. 29. \"The Indian government will send a plane to take them back directly.\"",
      "Many people staffing the fraud factories say they were trafficked into the hubs, although analysts say some workers also go willingly to secure attractive salary offers.",
      "In February, some workers who fled scam centers in Myanmar and made it across the border to Thailand told the Reuters news agency they were regularly beaten and tortured by their bosses.",
      "\"I  got a lot of punishments, like I receive shock, electric shock  every day. I received punch every day,\" Yotor, a 19-year-old Ethiopian who escaped one of the compounds, told Reuters. \"They just want to  punish us, and they punish us. Because, like, we were working for 18  hours without salary, without, like they did not allow us to contact our  family.\"",
      "Experts say Myanmar's military, which has ruled over the country since seizing power in the 2021 coup, has long turned a blind eye to the scam centers, profits from which are believed to go to its militia allies, who are crucial collaborators in their fight against rebels.",
      "But the junta has also faced pressure to shut down scam operations from its military backer China, irked at its citizens both participating in and being targeted by the scams.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The suit worn by Will Ferrell in the 2003 comedy hit \"Elf\" is going under the hammer at an auction of movie memorabilia in London this December, and the skin-tight green and yellow piece of Hollywood Christmas magic is expected to fetch over a quarter of a million dollars.",
      "Bidding for the iconic suit, complete with the conical hat and matching tunic, will begin at 50,000 pounds, the equivalent of about $65,000, but it's expected to eventually sell for as much as 200,000 pounds, or about $261,000, when the hammer falls at the Propstore Winter Entertainment Memorabilia auction.",
      "According to the description on the Propstore Auction house's website, there are tags reading \"Mr. Ferrell\" on the inside of the tunic and the stockings, with \"Hero-3\" also handwritten on the tunic tag.",
      "The auctioneers say the belt also has \"Mr. Ferrell\" written on it in blue ink.",
      "Large movie productions often create several versions of the same props, but the term \"hero\" is typically used to describe the highly detailed iterations which are central to the plot and intended for close-up shots in the final cut of the movie.",
      "The suit going up for sale does not appear to be the same one that Ferrell wore to an NHL hockey game in Los Angeles just after Christmas last year, when he gave fellow sports fans a giggle by sitting near the ice looking disgruntled with a beer and a cigarette in the garish outfit.",
      "Another notable item up for sale in the December auction is Marty McFly's iconic hoverboard from the second and third installations of the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, which is expected to sell for more than $156,000.",
      "According to the product description, it's the lightweight foam version of the prop, which actors used for scenes where their characters were seen carrying the boards, rather than a wooden version that Michael J. Fox and his fellow actors were seen riding in other parts of the movies.",
      "The example of the then-futuristic hoverboard does have some \"wear from use and age, including adhesive residue around the fastening strips, cracks in the foam, and paint chipping throughout,\" according to the auctioneers.",
      "The most valuable lot in the auction, however, will be the original prop used as Boba Fett's rifle in \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.\"",
      "The auction house says it is the only known example of the prop. Other stunt versions and castings were made for later movies in the franchise, but, according to Propstore Auctions, this EE-3 carbine blaster has been \"identified by its serial number and photo-matched by details on the stock, directly confirming its provenance.\"",
      "The blaster, which started its life as a genuine 1917 Webley & Scott No.1 Mark I flare pistol, is expected to fetch the equivalent of around $915,000 when it goes under the hammer.",
      "The three day auction begins on Dec. 5 and will feature other iconic film memorabilia including Indiana Jones' fedora, worn by Harrison Ford in the 1984 \"Temple of Doom\" movie, Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightweight lightsaber from 1999's \"Phantom Menace,\" and Jack Nicholson's stunt axe from the horror classic \"The Shining.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Jamaican government on Monday said at least 32 deaths have been attributed to\u00a0Hurricane Melissa, with Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon saying there are possibly eight more unconfirmed deaths.",
      "With its tourism season just a month away, officials are rushing to rebuild from the\u00a0catastrophic Category 5 storm\u00a0that shredded the island's western region. Before the hurricane hit on Oct. 28, the government expected Jamaica's tourism industry to grow by 7% this winter season and was preparing to welcome an estimated 4.3 million visitors.",
      "Now, officials are scrambling to repair hotels and clear debris in the western half of the island in the hope of securing tourist dollars at a moment when they're needed most.",
      "Melissa was the most powerful hurricane to lash the island since record-keeping began 174 years ago. The National Hurricane Center said the storm initially came ashore near New Hope, on the southwestern coast of Jamaica.",
      "Before the storm, the Jamaican government said it had done all it could to prepare. \"There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness had said.",
      "\"We are still doing our assessments, but most of the damage was in the northwest and southwest,\" said Christopher Jarrett, who leads the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association.",
      "He noted that the popular Negril area in Westmoreland was spared major damage.",
      "All international airports in Jamaica have reopened and are receiving commercial flights. But almost a week after\u00a0one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record\u00a0struck the western end of Jamaica, tourism officials were still trying to get a true picture of the damage to the sector \u2014 a mainstay of the island's economy.",
      "Jarrett said the lobby group that represents private hotels and attractions on the island is still unable to reach many of its members, especially in the western parish of Hanover, as communication and electricity services were down.",
      "\"Every individual member who was affected is doing everything to get back up and running,\" he said.",
      "In recent days, Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett said he expected Jamaica's tourism sector to be back to normal by Dec. 15, the start of the island's peak tourism season.",
      "\"It's doable for some and not for others,\" Jarrett said of the timeline, pointing out that the larger hotel chains would be able to recover quicker.",
      "Jarrett, who operates the family-owned Altamont Court Hotel that has properties in Kingston and Montego Bay, said only one property in Montego Bay sustained roof damage and that repairs were underway.",
      "Despite the disruption to the important tourism sector, Jarrett said he doesn't expect the economic fallout to be significant. He said many hotels in the capital of Kingston and in the northern coastal town of Ocho Rios were gaining business from the influx of aid workers and volunteers in the hurricane's aftermath.",
      "\"Right now, we're giving discounts, between 25% and 50%, and some [hotels] are giving complimentary stays as well,\" Jarrett said.",
      "Tourism is Jamaica's main source of foreign exchange earnings, contributing a combined 30% to gross domestic product directly and indirectly. It employs an estimated 175,000 people and is a major economic driver for other sectors in the Jamaican economy, such as construction, banking and finance, utilities and agriculture.",
      "The disruption to the tourism sector is also affecting many providers of goods and services.",
      "\"With some of the hotels closed and most of the tourists gone, many of us are left without work. This storm didn't just destroy buildings; it shattered jobs and incomes for many of us and our families,\" said Patricia Mighten, who works in the western parish of Hanover as a hotel housekeeper.",
      "Desrine Smith, a craft vendor who plies her trade in the resort town of Falmouth in the northwestern parish of Trelawny, echoed those sentiments.",
      "\"Going days without tourists coming to buy anything means no sales and no money. We survive on daily earnings, and now everything is uncertain,\" she said. \"The hurricane has impacted our pockets hard.\"",
      "Crews are still trying to access 25 isolated areas in western Jamaica as helicopters continue to drop food for them. Nearly half of all power customers remain without electricity.",

    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 Firefighters late Monday finally managed to extract a worker from beneath rubble inside a medieval tower that partially collapsed during renovation work in the heart of Italy's capital, but the joy of that rescue proved short-lived.",
      "The man didn't withstand the trauma he suffered and died soon thereafter.",
      "\"I express deep sorrow and condolences, on behalf of myself and the government, for the tragic loss of Octay Stroici, the worker who was killed in the collapse of the Torre dei Conti in Rome,\" Italy's Premier Giorgia Meloni said in a statement after midnight. \"We are close to his family and colleagues at this time of unspeakable suffering.\"",
      "Images broadcast on local television had shown a trio of rescuers loading the man onto a telescopic aerial ladder, then descending and wheeling him on a stretcher into an ambulance. His state wasn't immediately clear, but Adriano De Acutis, chief commander of Rome's firefighters, said on state television channel RAI that he was conscious.",
      "\"Since the conditions seem serious, they will now evaluate him and he was immediately taken to the hospital,\" Lamberto Giannini, prefect of Rome, told reporters at the time.",
      "Rescuers had faced a complex task as they tried to use a first-floor window to get near the trapped worker. But they were forced to retreat in a cloud of debris as the structure continued to give way. Another approach on two ladders was also aborted, and a drone sent up in their stead.",
      "As dusk approached, firefighters lifted on a crane used giant tubes to suck rubble out of the second-floor window. They continued the work late into the night.",
      "\"The operation lasted a long time because every time a part of the body was freed, there was additional rubble that covered it,\" Giannini said.",
      "Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri had told reporters earlier that the worker was speaking to rescuers and using an oxygen mask. He added that rescuers were working with extreme caution in \"a very delicate extraction operation\" to avoid further collapses.",
      "Three workers were rescued unharmed after the initial midday incident, said firefighter spokesperson Luca Cari. Another worker, age 64, was hospitalized in critical condition; RAI reported he was conscious and had suffered a broken nose.",
      "No firefighters were injured in the ensuing operation.",
      "The Torre dei Conti was built in the 13th century by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his family. The tower was damaged in a 1349 earthquake and suffered subsequent collapses in the 17th century.",
      "Hundreds of tourists had gathered to watch as firefighters used a mobile ladder to bring a stretcher to the upper level of the Torre dei Conti during the first rescue attempt. Suddenly, another part of the structure crumbled, sending up a cloud of debris and forcing firefighters to quickly descend.",
      "The first collapse struck the central buttress of the structure's southern side, and caused an underlying sloped base to fall. The second damaged part of the stairwell and roof, cultural heritage officials said in a statement.",
      "Queen Paglinawan, 27, was attending to a client in a gelato parlor next door when the tower first started coming apart.",
      "\"I was working and then I heard something falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,\u2033 Paglinawan, 27, told The Associated Press as yet more rubble crashed down.",
      "The tower, which has been closed since 2007, is undergoing a 6.9 million euro (nearly $8 million) restoration that includes conservation work, the installation of electrical, lighting and water systems and a new museum installation dedicated to the most recent phases of the Roman Imperial Forum, officials said.",
      "Before the latest phase was started in June, structural surveys and load tests were carried out \"to verify the stability of the structure, which confirmed the safety conditions necessary\" to proceed with work, including asbestos removal, officials said. The current work, carried out at a cost of 400,000 euros ($460,000), was just about complete.",
      "Italian prosecutors arrived at the scene as the rescue operation was underway, and were investigating possible charges for negligent disaster and negligent injuries, Italian media reported. It is common in Italy for investigations to begin while an event is ongoing and before possible suspects are identified.",
      "German student Viktoria Braeu had just finished a tour at the nearby Colosseum and was passing by the scene during the firefighters' initial rescue attempt.",
      "\"And then we were like, 'It's probably not long until it's going to go down,' and then it just started erupting,'\" said Braeu, 18.",
      "Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Meloni had shared her hopes for a successful rescue.",
      "\"My thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to the person currently fighting for his life under the rubble and to his family, for whom I sincerely hope that this tragedy will have a positive outcome,\" Meloni said in a statement.",
      "\"I would like to thank all the law enforcement officers, firefighters, and rescue workers who are intervening with courage, professionalism, and dedication in this extremely difficult situation.\"",

      "A Pakistani official told CBS News that the country \"will not be the first to resume nuclear tests\" in response to President Trump's assertion in an\u00a0interview with 60 Minutes that the country has conducted nuclear weapons tests, along with Russia and China.",

      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" Mr. Trump said, explaining his recent announcement that the U.S. would carry out tests of its nuclear weapons. \"We're gonna test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing.\"",
      "Trump made the assertion to O'Donnell during an interview that was broadcast just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. China's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1996.",
      "Pakistan's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1998, and it since then its government says it has observed a \"unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing,\" despite not being a signatory to the international Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).",
      "The U.S. is among almost 180 nations that have signed the CTBT, which bans all atomic test explosions.",
      "Along with China and several other nuclear powers, however, the U.S. has never ratified the treaty, a situation that President Vladimir Putin highlighted two years ago when he decided to revoke Moscow's ratification.",
      "While Russia has stepped up its own tests of nuclear-capable weapons systems, it has not said it will resume nuclear detonations.",
      "On its website, the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that \"despite being a non-signatory state, Pakistan been supporting the objectives and purposes of the Treaty,\" and that in addition to its moratorium on nuclear tests, it \"will not be the first to resume testing of nuclear weapons in South Asia.\"",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's claims on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\"",
      "She said China hoped the U.S. would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Moscow to Mr. Trump's claim that Russia has also conducted secret nuclear tests.",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "President Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plan to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal include conducting actual atomic explosions, which have not been carried out in the U.S. more than 30 years, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, downplayed the notion on Sunday that the U.S. was about to start setting off nuclear explosions.",
      "\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",

      "Cairo\u00a0\u2014 The prime minister of the Netherlands announced Sunday that the European nation will soon return a 3,500-year-old sculpture to Egypt, a day after he attended the lavish opening ceremony of the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza.",
      "Prime Minister Dick Schoof said in a statement that, during a meeting on Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, he informed his counterpart that the Netherlands would return a bust of a high-ranking official from the dynasty of Pharaoh Thutmose III.",
      "The piece was discovered up for sale at an art fair in 2022 and was confiscated after Dutch authorities received an anonymous tip about its illegal origin, according to a statement from the Dutch government.",
      "The statement said the art show \"trader voluntarily renounced the sculpture\" and that Dutch police and other officials \"have investigated the origin of the head and found that the head was obtained by looting and was unlawfully exported.\"",
      "The bust is expected to be handed over to the Egyptian ambassador to the Netherlands by the end of this year, the statement said.",
      "It will be the first artifact returned to Egypt since the GEM's grand opening event. Several campaigns before the opening have sought to bring looted Egyptian antiquities back to the country.",
      "Egypt's government hosted dozens of foreign leaders and dignitaries on Saturday for the official opening ceremony of the new facility, a $1 billion project that was decades in the making.",
      "\"It is a great day for Egypt and for humanity. This is Egypt's gift to the world. It's a dream come true, after all these years, the GEM is finally and officially open,\" Nevine El-Aref, media adviser to the Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, told CBS News on Saturday.",
      "The GEM is one of the largest museums in the world, and the largest dedicated to a single civilization: ancient Egypt. Its subject matter spans some 7,000 years, from prehistory to the end of the Greek and Roman eras around 400 A.D.",
      "Egyptian officials hope the new museum will boost the country's tourism industry, and with it, the still-struggling economy. They have predicted that the GEM will attract some 5 million visitors per year.",

    "summary": "Belgium's defense minister confirmed that drones had flown into the area near the Kleine Brogel air base in northeast Belgium in two phases.",
    "story": [
      "Belgium's defense minister expressed concern on Monday about a series of unidentified drone flights over the weekend near a military base where U.S. nuclear weapons are stored, saying they seem to be part of a spying operation.",
      "Defense Minister Theo Francken confirmed that drones had flown into the area near the Kleine Brogel air base in northeast Belgium in two phases on Saturday and Sunday night.",
      "The first phase involved \"small drones to test the radio frequencies\" of Belgian security services, then later came \"big drones to destabilize the area and people,\" Francken told public broadcaster RTBF.",
      "\"It resembles a spy operation. By whom, I don't know. I have a few ideas but I'm going to be careful\" about speculating, he said. Last month, several drones were spotted above another Belgian military base near the German border. The operators were not identified.",
      "Russia has been blamed for a number of airspace violations, notably in Estonia and Poland, in recent months. But the perpetrators of a series of mysterious drone flights in Denmark and Germany have been harder to pin down.",
      "A late evening drone sighting at Berlin's Brandenburg airport on Friday suspended flights for nearly two hours. It was not clear who was responsible. On Sunday, some flights were delayed at Bremen Airport in Germany after a drone was spotted in the area, but police did not suspect espionage in that case, local media reported.",
      "Francken ruled out that the weekend drone flights in Belgium might have been a prank. He said that the security services' \"jammer didn't work because they tested our radio frequency, and they changed frequency. They have their own frequencies. An amateur doesn't know how to do that.\"",
      "Asked why it wasn't possible to shoot the drones down, Francken said: \"When they're over a military base we can shoot the drones down. When it's nearby, we have to be very careful because they can fall on a house, a car, a person. That's completely different.\"",
      "This can pose legal challenges too. \"It's not entirely clear. We have to clarify the legal grounds,\" he said.",
      "Francken lamented that Belgium \"is chasing after the threat\" posed by such drone flights. \"We should have bought air defense systems five or 10 years ago,\" that can deal with drones, he said.",
      "A series of mysterious drone overflights have been spotted in the airspace of European Union member countries in recent weeks.",
      "In October, a Belgian official familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News that drones had been sighted over Elsenborn military base, and said that the number of drones was under investigation. Belgium is a member of the U.S.-led NATO military alliance but the source told CBS News that only Belgian forces are stationed at the Elsenborn base.",
      "Also last month, Germany's Munich Airport shut down twice in less than 24 hours after multiple drone sightings. An airport in Lithuania also later closed for several hours overnight Saturday due to a possible sighting of balloons.",
      "In September, the Danish defense ministry said drones were \"observed at several of Danish defense facilities\" during an overnight period. Those drone sightings\u00a0come after several drones were spotted in the Nordic country days earlier, with some of them temporarily shutting down Danish airports.",
      "Drones have also been spotted near military sites in the U.S. this year. The head of NORAD and NORTHCOM \u2014 the military commands that defend North America \u2014 told Congress earlier this year that some of the mysterious drones seen flying inside the United States may indeed have been spying.",

    "summary": "China rejects Trump's claim to 60 Minutes about clandestine nuclear tests, as a senior official seeks to clarify the president's plans for U.S. tests.",
    "story": [
      "China's Foreign Ministry responded on Monday to President Trump's assertion that Beijing has conducted clandestine nuclear weapons testing with a flat denial.",
      "\"China's testing 'em too,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell in an interview for 60 Minutes. \"You just don't know about it.\"",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are going to report \u2014 they don't have reporters that going to be writing about it. We do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the claim in the interview with O'Donnell that aired just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. China's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1996.",
      "\"They don't go and tell you about it,\" continued Mr. Trump. \"You know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. They \u2014 they test way under \u2014 underground where people don't know exactly what's happening with the test.",
      "\"You feel a little bit of a vibration. They test and we don't test. We have to test. And Russia did make a little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China \u2014 and China does test, and we're gonna test also.\"",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's claims on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\"",
      "She said China hoped the U.S. would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability.\"",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "President Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plans to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal include conducting actual atomic explosions, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, downplayed the notion on Sunday that the U.S. was about to start setting off nuclear explosions.",
      "\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",
      "The U.S. is among almost 180 nations that have signed the international Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions.",
      "Along with China and several other nuclear powers, however, the U.S. has never ratified the treaty, a situation that President Vladimir Putin highlighted two years ago when he decided to revoke Moscow's ratification.",
      "While Russia has stepped up its own tests of nuclear-capable and even nuclear-powered weapons systems, it has not said it will resume nuclear detonations.",

      "Evolving advice",
      "Before 2015, it was standard practice to caution parents about peanut exposure for children under 3 years of age. Then in 2015, a landmark study \u2014 the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial \u2014 sparked a change in clinical practice.",
      "The study found that for infants who had severe eczema or an egg allergy, exposing them to peanuts when they were between 4 and 11 months old could reduce peanut allergy risk by 81%.",

      "These effects can sometimes linger even after the person has recovered from the infection.

      "Hispanic voters \u2013 who have been a focus of Republican courtship in recent years \u2013 did not support Republicans as much as they hoped. Ultimately, they sided with the Democrats by over 30 points. White voters overall broke for Ciattarelli, largely fueled by a 20-point gap in his support among White men.

      "The Fox News Voter Poll is based on a survey conducted by SSRS with New Jersey registered voters. This survey was conducted October 22 to November 4, 2025, concluding at the end of voting on Election Day. The poll combines data collected from registered voters online and by telephone with data collected in-person from Election Day voters at 30 precincts per state. In the final step, all the pre-election survey respondents and Election Day exit poll respondents are combined by adjusting the share of voting mode (absentee, early-in-person, and Election Day) based on the estimated composition of the state final electorate. Once votes are counted, the survey results are also weighted to match the overall results in each state. Results among all more than 4,400 New Jersey voters interviewed have an estimated margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points, including the design effects. The error margin is larger among subgroups."

      "Methodology",
      "The Fox News Voter Poll is based on a survey conducted by SSRS with Virginia registered voters. This survey was conducted October 22 to November 4, 2025, concluding at the end of voting on Election Day. The poll combines data collected from registered voters online and by telephone with data collected in-person from Election Day voters at 30 precincts per state/city. In the final step, all the pre-election survey respondents and Election Day exit poll respondents are combined by adjusting the share of voting mode (absentee, early-in-person, and Election Day) based on the estimated composition of the state/city\u2019s final electorate. Once votes are counted, the survey results are also weighted to match the overall results in each state. Results among more than 4,500 Virginia voters interviewed have an estimated margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points, including the design effects.\u00a0The error margin is larger among subgroups."

      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "A new scam called ghost tapping is spreading across the country. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) warns that scammers are using this tactic to steal money from people who use tap-to-pay credit cards and mobile wallets.",
      "This scam exploits wireless technology to withdraw money without your awareness. Many victims only realize something is wrong after small, unnoticed transactions slowly drain their accounts.",

      "The Better Business Bureau warns of a new \"ghost-tapping\" scam draining money from tap-to-pay cards and mobile wallets. (Clara Margais/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "How the ghost-tapping scam works",
      "Scammers use near-field communication (NFC) devices that mimic legitimate tap-to-pay systems. In busy places such as festivals, markets, or public transportation, they move close enough to your wallet or phone to trigger a transaction.",
      "The BBB reports that some scammers pose as charity vendors or market sellers who only accept tap payments. Once you tap your card or phone, they charge far more than the agreed amount.",
      "Because the first few withdrawals are usually small, they often go undetected by fraud systems. Victims may not notice until much later, when more money has been taken.",
      "Real-life cases and warnings",
      "A Missouri resident reportedly lost $100 after being approached by a person carrying a handheld card reader. The BBB Scam Tracker has recorded many similar cases across the nation, with losses sometimes exceeding $1,000.",
      "Officials warn that scammers may pressure you to complete payments quickly, preventing you from verifying the amount or merchant name. Some even carry portable readers that can pick up signals through thin wallets or purses.",
      "How to protect yourself from ghost tapping",
      "While the threat of ghost tapping may sound alarming, protecting yourself is easier than you think. A few smart habits and security tools can greatly reduce your risk of falling victim.",
      "Invest in an RFID-blocking wallet or card sleeve to create a physical barrier between your card and potential scanners. These inexpensive tools prevent scammers from reading your card information through clothing, bags, or wallets. Look for sleeves or wallets specifically designed to block wireless communication.",
      "Always check the merchant name and transaction amount displayed on the payment terminal before tapping. Scammers often rush you to avoid scrutiny. Take an extra second to confirm what you see matches what you agreed to pay. If something looks off, cancel the transaction immediately.",
      "Enable instant transaction alerts from your bank or credit card provider. This lets you know the moment a payment is made, giving you a chance to spot unauthorized activity right away. Quick detection can prevent further charges and make it easier to dispute fraudulent transactions.",
      "Bonus protection: Even if you stop a scam early, your personal data can end up for sale online. Our No. 1 identity theft company monitors your credit and financial information, alerting you if your details appear on the dark web or in a data breach.",

      "The BBB says reports of \"ghost tapping\" are rising, with some victims losing more than $1,000 to contactless theft. (M. Scott Brauer/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Crowded environments such as festivals, public transportation, or street fairs create perfect conditions for scammers to blend in. Limit tap-to-pay use in these situations. Instead, use chip or swipe methods, which require physical contact and are harder to exploit.",
      "Make it a habit to check your financial accounts at least once a week. Review each transaction carefully and report anything suspicious to your bank immediately. Even small unexplained charges could signal a larger problem.",
      "Most mobile wallet apps allow you to set PINs, facial recognition, or fingerprint verification before authorizing a transaction. Make sure these protections are enabled. This adds another barrier that prevents criminals from initiating payments without your consent.",
      "Regularly update your smartphone's software and mobile wallet apps. Updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities scammers might exploit. Outdated software can leave your data exposed.",
      "Stay protected from payment-stealing malware:",
      "In addition to keeping your apps updated, protect your device from hidden threats with strong antivirus software. It scans for malicious apps and spyware that can hijack your tap-to-pay data or record sensitive information.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "While convenient, storing several cards in one app can increase your exposure if your phone is compromised. Keep only the cards you use most often connected to your mobile wallet. This reduces the impact of potential fraudulent activity.",
      "If you ever suspect ghost tapping or notice a strange charge, contact your bank immediately and report the scam to the BBB Scam Tracker. Quick action can help prevent additional losses and assist authorities in identifying scam trends.",
      "Victims of \"ghost tapping\" often lose money through small, unnoticed transactions before realizing they\u2019ve been scammed. (Leonie Asendorpf/picture alliance via Getty Images)",

      "As contactless payments become more common, scammers are getting more creative. Staying informed and cautious can help protect your money. Small steps like checking your transaction history and using protective gear can make a big difference. If you notice unauthorized charges, contact your bank immediately, freeze your card and report the scam to the BBB Scam Tracker. Technology offers convenience but can also create new risks.

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "A security researcher found a serious weakness in the software that powers thousands of e-commerce sites. The platform, called Magento, and its paid version Adobe Commerce, has a bug that lets attackers break into active shopping sessions. Some attackers can even take control of the entire store.",
      "The flaw is known as SessionReaper. It allows hackers to pretend they are real customers without needing a password. Once they are inside, they can steal data, make fake orders, or install tools that collect credit card details.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "Why is this attack so serious?",
      "The problem starts in the part of the system that handles how a store communicates with other online services. Because the software does not properly check the information it receives, it sometimes trusts data that it should not. Hackers take advantage of this by sending fake session files that the store accepts as real.",
      "Researchers at SecPod warn that successful attacks can lead to stolen customer data, fake purchases and even full control of the store's server.",
      "Once the attack method was shared publicly, cybercriminals began using it right away. Security experts at Sansec reported that more than 250 online stores were compromised within a single day. This shows how quickly attacks can spread once a vulnerability becomes public.",
      "Hackers are exploiting a new flaw called SessionReaper to hijack active shopping sessions on thousands of e-commerce sites running Adobe Commerce and Magento. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Why are many stores still unprotected?",
      "Adobe released a security update on Sept. 9 to fix the issue. Weeks later, about 62% of affected stores still have not installed it. Some store owners are afraid an update might break features on their site. Others simply do not know how serious the risk is.",
      "Every unpatched store remains an open door for attackers who want to steal information or install malicious code.",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "How can you stay safe when shopping online?",
      "While store owners are responsible for fixing the problem, you can still take smart steps to protect yourself when shopping online. These actions can help you spot danger early and keep your personal information safe.",
      "Always pay attention to how a website behaves. If a page looks odd, loads slowly or shows error messages, it could mean something is wrong behind the scenes. Check for the small padlock symbol in the address bar that shows the site uses HTTPS encryption. If it is missing or the site redirects you to an unfamiliar page, stop and close the browser tab immediately. Trust your instincts if something feels off.",
      "Cybercriminals often use fake promotional emails or ads that look like real store offers. Instead of clicking links in messages or banners, type the store's web address directly into your browser to avoid phishing pages designed to steal your login details or card information. Since attacks like SessionReaper can expose your personal data to criminal marketplaces, consider using a reputable data removal service that continuously scans and deletes your private information, such as your address, phone number and email, from data broker sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft if your information has been leaked through a compromised online store.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Cybersecurity teams at SecPod and Sansec tracked more than 250 stores breached within 24 hours of the exploit going public, showing how fast these attacks spread. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Strong antivirus protection is your silent guard online. Choose reputable software that offers real-time protection, safe browsing alerts and automatic updates. A strong antivirus program can detect malicious code that tries to run on your device, block unsafe sites and alert you to potential threats. This adds another crucial layer of defense when visiting online stores that may not be fully secure.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Whenever possible, choose payment services that add an extra layer of protection between your bank account and the online store. Platforms like PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay do not share your card number with the retailer. This reduces the chance of your information being stolen if the store is compromised. These payment gateways also offer dispute protection if a purchase turns out to be fraudulent.",
      "Stick to stores with a solid reputation. Well-known brands usually have better security and faster response times when issues arise. Before buying from a new website, check its reviews on trusted consumer sites. Look for signs of credibility such as clear contact information, a professional design and verified payment options. A few minutes of research can save you from weeks of frustration.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Updates may seem annoying, but they are one of the most effective ways to protect your data. Make sure your computer, smartphone and web browser all have the latest security patches installed. Updates often fix the exact kinds of flaws hackers use to spread attacks like SessionReaper. Enable automatic updates if you can, so your devices stay protected without extra effort.",
      "If you create accounts on shopping sites, make sure each one has its own strong password. Avoid using the same password across multiple platforms. Consider using a password manager to generate and store long, random passwords. That way, if one account is compromised, your other logins stay safe.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "If a site or payment service offers\u00a0two-factor authentication, enable it. This adds a second security step, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an app. Even if hackers steal your password, they will not be able to access your account without that second verification.",
      "Even weeks after Adobe issued a critical patch for the SessionReaper vulnerability, nearly two-thirds of affected online stores remain unprotected, leaving customer data and payment information at high risk of theft. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Public Wi-Fi networks\u00a0in places like caf\u00e9s, airports and hotels are often unsecured. Avoid entering payment information or logging in to accounts while connected to public networks. If you must make a purchase while away from home, use a mobile data connection or a reliable VPN to encrypt your activity.",
      "Check your financial statements regularly for any unusual activity. Small, unauthorized charges can be early signs of fraud. Report any suspicious transactions to your bank or credit card company right away so they can freeze your account or issue a new card.",
      "If you notice anything strange during or after an online purchase, act quickly. Contact the store's customer service to report what you saw. You should also inform your payment provider or credit card company so they can block unauthorized transactions. Reporting early can help stop further damage and alert other shoppers to potential risks.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The SessionReaper attack shows how fast online threats can appear and how long they can linger when updates are ignored. Even well-known stores can become unsafe overnight. For retailers, installing patches quickly is critical. For shoppers, staying alert and choosing secure payment methods are the best ways to stay protected.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to warn about a disturbing new scam where criminals use AI to clone the voices of loved ones and trick victims into sending money.",
      "The dark web often feels like a mystery, hidden beneath the surface of the internet that most people use every day. But to understand how scams and cybercrimes actually work, you need to know what happens in those hidden corners where criminals trade data, services and stolen access.",
      "Cybercriminals rely on a structured underground economy, complete with marketplaces, rules and even dispute systems to operate safely away from law enforcement. By learning how these systems function, you can better understand the threats that could reach you and avoid becoming the next target.",

      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Learn how to protect your personal information from dark web threats with simple cybersecurity habits and tools. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "Inside the hidden layers of the internet",
      "The internet is often divided into three layers: the clear web, the deep web and the dark web. The clear web is the open part of the internet that search engines like Google or Bing can index, including news sites, blogs, stores and public pages. Beneath it lies the deep web, which includes pages not meant for public indexing, such as corporate intranets, private databases and webmail portals. Most of the content in the deep web is legal but simply restricted to specific users.",
      "The dark web, however, is where anonymity and illegality intersect. It requires special software such as Tor to access, and much of its activity happens behind encryption and invitation-only walls. Tor, short for The Onion Router, was originally developed by the U.S. Navy for secure communication but has since become a haven for both privacy advocates and criminals.",
      "It anonymizes users by routing traffic through multiple encrypted layers, making it almost impossible to trace where a request truly came from. This anonymity allows criminals to communicate, sell data and conduct illegal trade with reduced risk of exposure.",
      "Over time, the dark web has become a hub for criminal commerce. Marketplaces once operated like eBay for illegal goods, offering everything from drugs and stolen credit card data to hacking tools and fake identities. Many of these platforms have been shut down, but the trade continues on smaller, more private channels, including encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram. Vendors use aliases, ratings and escrow systems to build credibility.",
      "Ironically, even among criminals, trust is a critical part of business. Forums often have administrators, verified sellers and mediators to settle disputes. Members who cheat others or fail to deliver are quickly blacklisted, and reputation becomes the main currency that determines who can be trusted.",
      "The criminal economy and how scams are born",
      "Every major cyberattack or data leak often traces back to the dark web's underground economy. A single attack typically involves several layers of specialists. It begins with information stealers, malware designed to capture credentials, cookies and device fingerprints from infected machines. The stolen data is then bundled and sold in dark web markets by data suppliers. Each bundle, known as a log, might contain login credentials, browser sessions and even authentication tokens, often selling for less than $20.",
      "Another group of criminals, known as initial access brokers, purchases these logs to gain entry into corporate systems. With that access, they can impersonate legitimate users and bypass security measures such as multi-factor authentication by mimicking the victim's usual device or browser. Once inside, these brokers sometimes auction their access to larger criminal gangs or ransomware operators who are capable of exploiting it further.",
      "Some of these auctions are run as competitions, while others are flash sales where well-funded groups can buy access immediately without bidding. Eventually, this chain of transactions ends with a ransomware attack or an extortion demand, as attackers encrypt sensitive data or threaten to leak it publicly.",
      "Interestingly, even within these illegal spaces, scams are common. New vendors often post fake listings for stolen data or hacking tools, collect payments and disappear. Others impersonate trusted members or set up counterfeit escrow services to lure buyers.",
      "Despite all the encryption and reputation systems, no one is truly safe from fraud, not even the criminals themselves. This constant cycle of deception forces dark web communities to build internal rules, verification processes and penalties to keep their operations somewhat functional.",
      "What you can do to stay ahead of dark web-driven threats",
      "For ordinary people and businesses, understanding how these networks operate is key to preventing their effects. Many scams that appear in your inbox or on social media originate from credentials or data first stolen and sold on the dark web. That is why basic digital hygiene goes a long way. Below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",

      "From password managers to antivirus software, experts share practical ways to keep hackers out of your data. (Annette Riedl/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "A growing number of companies specialize in removing your personal data from online databases and people search sites. These platforms often collect and publish names, addresses, phone numbers and even family details without consent, creating easy targets for scammers and identity thieves.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "One of the easiest ways to stay safe online is to use unique, complex passwords for every account you own. Many breaches happen because people reuse the same password across multiple services. When one site is hacked, cybercriminals take those leaked credentials and try them elsewhere, a technique known as credential stuffing. A password manager eliminates this problem by generating strong, random passwords and securely storing them for you.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Antivirus software remains one of the most effective ways to detect and block malicious programs before they can steal your information. Modern antivirus solutions do far more than just scan for viruses. They monitor system behavior, detect phishing attempts and prevent infostealer malware from sending your credentials or personal data to attackers.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Outdated software is one of the biggest entry points for attackers. Cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems, browsers and plugins to deliver malware or gain access to systems. Installing updates as soon as they are available is one of the simplest yet most effective forms of defense. Enable automatic updates for your operating system, browsers and critical applications.",
      "Even if your password gets leaked or stolen,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional barrier for attackers. With 2FA, logging in requires both your password and a secondary verification method. This includes code from an authentication app or a hardware security key.",
      "Identity theft protection can provide early warnings if your personal information appears in data breaches or on dark web marketplaces. These services monitor your sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers, bank details or email addresses. If anything suspicious is detected, they alert you. Many providers also offer recovery assistance, helping you restore stolen identities or close fraudulent accounts. While no service can prevent identity theft entirely, these tools can shorten your response time and limit potential damage if your data is compromised.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The dark web thrives on the idea that anonymity equals safety. But while criminals may feel protected, law enforcement and security researchers continue to monitor and infiltrate these spaces. Over the years, many large marketplaces have been dismantled, and hundreds of operators have been caught despite their layers of encryption. The takeaway for everyone else is that the more you understand how these underground systems function, the better prepared you are to recognize warning signs and protect yourself.",

      "LIVING IN GIANT MOON GLASS SPHERES COULD BE OUR FUTURE",
      "Starcloud aims to build the first orbital data centers, cutting emissions and speeding up global computing. (Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)",
      "Why space data centers matter for the future",
      "Every time you send a message, store a file in the cloud or use AI, large computers on Earth handle the work. These data centers use massive amounts of electricity and water to stay cool. They also release heat, noise and greenhouse gases that affect local communities.",
      "Space offers a different environment. Solar energy is abundant, and cooling happens naturally in the cold vacuum.\u00a0\"The only environmental cost is the launch,\" said Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston.\u00a0\"After that, we could save ten times the carbon emissions compared with running data centers on Earth.\"",
      "For a world searching for greener technology, that goal matters.",
      "How the NVIDIA GPU will work in orbit",
      "The Starcloud-1 satellite, about the size of a small refrigerator, will carry NVIDIA's H100 GPU. It is nearly one hundred times more powerful than any chip ever sent into orbit.",
      "Once in space, the GPU will process huge amounts of satellite data. It will study images of Earth to identify wildfires, track crops and monitor weather. Normally, satellites send this data back to Earth for processing, which can cause long delays. Doing the analysis in orbit allows faster results and better decisions on the ground.",
      "The mission will also test Google's Gemma language model in orbit. It will be the first time a large AI model operates in space.",

      "By processing satellite data in orbit, Starcloud hopes to make Earth monitoring faster and more efficient. (Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)",
      "Starcloud plans to build space data centers",
      "Starcloud hopes this is only the beginning. The company plans to build larger data centers in space powered by sunlight and cooled by the natural chill of orbit. Future systems will include the next generation of NVIDIA GPUs called Blackwell, which promise even higher performance.",
      "Starcloud's long-term goal is to create a five-gigawatt orbital data center about 2.5 miles wide (around 13,000 feet across). It could handle massive AI workloads while cutting costs and carbon emissions. As launch prices continue to fall, building data centers beyond Earth could soon become practical.",
      "Johnston believes that by the 2030s, many new data centers will operate in orbit instead of on land.",
      "What this space mission means for you",
      "If this works, the technology that powers your apps, games and AI tools might soon be running in space. This change could make cloud services faster, more efficient and less harmful to the planet.",
      "Space-based data centers could also speed up disaster response, improve weather forecasts and save millions of gallons of water every year. The idea shows that innovation and sustainability can grow together.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Sending an NVIDIA GPU into orbit shows how quickly technology is changing. The mission combines curiosity, innovation and a genuine push to make computing cleaner and faster. As space becomes more reachable, the idea of data centers floating above Earth feels less like fiction and more like something that could actually happen. Each of these missions could teach us a little more about how to build a sustainable digital future.",

Troy Hunt also confirmed the dataset originated from Synthient\u2019s collection of infostealer logs, not from a single platform or recent attack. While no new breach occurred, experts warn that leaked credentials remain dangerous because cybercriminals reuse them for future attacks.",

      "Mendoza described Mamdani as a \"trailblazer\" for hard-left movements that have often struggled to win major offices in Western democracies. \"He\u2019s bringing victory where there has always previously been defeat for politicians of the far left,\" he said. \"His tactics, his style, his pronouncements \u2014 his form of forging a governing coalition, are going to be of keen interest to similar hard leftists around the world.\"",

      "Democratic wins in Tuesday\u2019s elections gave the party a sorely needed burst of momentum ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "The party came in favored in races for Virginia and New Jersey governor, New York City mayor and a California ballot measure to green-light a Democratic gerrymander of the state\u2019s congressional map.",
      "But the huge margins in those governor\u2019s races and other contests left many Democrats feeling a new emotion \u2014 excitement \u2014 for the first time in some time. The results affirmed the candidates\u2019 decisions to run economic-centered campaigns, highlighted Republicans\u2019 trouble replicating President Donald Trump\u2019s coalition and included other signs of repudiation and warning for Trump.",
      "Even as they caution there are limits to how much these Democratic victories in several blue-leaning areas can translate into 2026 midterm elections on far more competitive turf, some Republicans are sounding the alarm.",
      "\u201cIt was a bloodbath. It\u2019s a disastrous night for Republicans in the state, and I think nationally folks should probably heed some warnings as well,\u201d said Mike DuHaime, a longtime New Jersey GOP strategist and former Republican National Committee political director. \u201cIt shows there\u2019s some discontent certainly with the current administration and it shows that candidates and campaigns matter as well\u201d",
      "Here are six big takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s campaigns \u2014 and what they mean for Trump, the midterms, and more.",
      "Democrats worked to make Trump an issue in their races, and it worked.",
      "New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger blamed Trump for voters\u2019 economic woes, while proponents of California\u2019s Proposition 50 framed their redistricting campaign as a way to push back on the president.",
      "Across all three states, exit polls show the president was a factor for a majority of voters, with most of those voters saying they saw their ballot as a way to oppose Trump.",
      "Spanberger and Sherrill won virtually all of the nearly 40% of voters in their states who saw their votes as a way to oppose Trump. In California, a majority of voters said the main reason for their proposition vote was to oppose Trump, and almost all of them supported the proposition.",
      "\u201cThis couldn\u2019t be a louder rebuke of Trump and Republicans,\u201d Democratic National Committee executive director Libby Schneider said in an interview. \u201cSo it\u2019s sort of a new day for Democrats tomorrow, but we\u2019re going to get right back to fighting.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, more than 60% of voters in New Jersey and Virginia also said they were \u201cdissatisfied or angry\u201d about the way things are going in the country. Out of that group, 77% said they voted for Spanberger and 75% backed Sherrill.",
      "A majority of Virginia voters (56%) said cuts to the federal government this year affected their family\u2019s finances either a lot or a little, and two-thirds of those voters broke for Spanberger. And majorities across both Virginia and New Jersey said the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement has gone too far, with the Democratic nominees winning about 90% of those who feel that way.",
      "Spanberger, Sherrill and Democrat Zohran Mamdani, who won the New York mayoral race, were all rewarded for making affordability and economic issues the center of the campaigns. Their victories came as voters have expressed deep dissatisfaction with Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, as outlined in the new NBC News poll released Sunday.",
      "National Democrats had largely seen the races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia as a key test of their candidates\u2019 focus on economic issues, after struggling on the issue in 2024, when Democrats controlled the White House and were seen as \u201cowning\u201d an unsteady economy.",
      "\u201cDemocrats win when we make it about what\u2019s going on at the local mall, not on the national mall,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist and veteran of Virginia campaigns.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s results in Virginia and New Jersey showed that \u201cpeople think Trump has made life harder and more expensive,\u201d Ferguson continued, adding that, \u201cOur candidates win \u2014 and can win big \u2014 when they show they\u2019re not part of that problem but the solution.\u201d",
      "The economy proved to be a top concern among Democratic voters, according to the NBC News Exit Poll. Nearly half of Virginia voters said it was the most important issue facing the state. Of those who said the economy was the most important issue, 59% supported Spanberger, while 39% backed GOP Lt. Gov Winsome Earle-Sears.",
      "While Republican Jack Ciattarelli won New Jersey voters who said taxes are the most important issue facing the state, Sherrill also won voters who said the top issue is the economy.",
      "Mamdani-style progressivism and the more centrist model of the Democratic Party embodied by Spanberger and Sherrill painted different pictures in these elections. But Democratic consultant Sam Cornale, a former top official at the Democratic National Committee, said it would be a mistake to read Tuesday\u2019s results as a \u201cfork in the road\u201d that forces his party to choose between different directions.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s what connects the winning Democratic campaigns that illuminates a single path for the party, he said, pointing to a tone of optimism that articulates a policy vision on issues like affordability \u2014 rather than simply attacking Trump \u2014 and the tactics of taking a message into politically hostile turf.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how they\u2019ve campaigned,\u201d Cornale said. \u201cThat\u2019s the model.\u201d",
      "Tuesday\u2019s elections also effectively kicked off next year\u2019s battle for control of Congress.",
      "California voters green-lit a new congressional map that could help Democrats flip up to five U.S. House seats from the state, a major victory for Democrats that helps to counter Republican redistricting efforts in other states.",
      "Democratic victories in Virginia \u2014 both at the statewide level and in expanding their majority in the state House \u2014 keep the party\u2019s hopes of redrawing the congressional maps there alive too.",
      "And the three victories in Pennsylvania to retain Democratic-backed state Supreme Court justices retain the party\u2019s edge on the court, which has decided a handful of high-profile election-related cases in recent years.",
      "More broadly, the results also provide other clues of what the state of play will be in key states and districts ahead of next year\u2019s major elections.",
      "Beyond the marquee races, for example, Democrats got more good news down the ballot in Georgia, where the party won two statewide elections for the state\u2019s Public Service Commission in what the Atlanta Journal-Constitution notes were the first Democratic victories in statewide, non-federal elections in almost 20 years.",
      "Meanwhile, while Mamdani\u2019s victory in New York marked a historic night for the Democrats, some Republicans are hopeful that they\u2019ve found a new bogeyman to energize their voters \u2014 a strategy that could spread to key House districts in the New York area and beyond next year.",
      "Republicans continue to have trouble getting Trump\u2019s supporters to vote when he is not on the ballot.",
      "\u201dTrying to be Donald Trump in a state that he lost is not enough, even if you execute the strategy,\u201d said DuHaime, the New Jersey Republican strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to put together Trump\u2019s coalition. It is unique to Trump.\u201d",
      "Trump made big gains in the Garden State in 2024 compared to his 2020 loss, performing better in working-class communities and more diverse parts of the state, including heavily Latino counties.",
      "But Ciattarelli struggled to replicate that coalition, even with Trump\u2019s endorsement.",
      "While Ciattarelli had a 7-point lead among voters without college degrees, Sherrill won voters making less than $100,000 and young men. Sherrill also appeared to easily win Latino voters, based on exit polling. She is heading for double-digit leads in heavily Latino counties including Passaic, which Trump flipped in 2024.",
      "Trump did not campaign with Ciattarelli in person, but he did hold a pair of telerallies. And Ciattarelli did not distance himself from the president.",
      "While Mamdani ran far to the left of Spanberger and Sherrill, all three fit their races.",
      "Spanberger and Sherrill provided lessons about \u201cwinning in this era,\u201d  Ferguson said, especially as it pertains to swing and independent voters, while Mamdani\u2019s win should teach the party about \u201ccommunicating in this moment.\u201d According to the exit polls, the gubernatorial contenders\u2019 personal favorability was better than the Democratic Party\u2019s.",
      "Meanwhile, despite all the headwinds favoring Spanberger in Virginia, outgoing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin still received high marks in exit polls. But Earle-Sears, his lieutenant governor, couldn\u2019t replicate his 2021 winning coalition.",
      "\u201cWinsome wasn\u2019t able to capitalize,\u201d said Zack Roday, a Virginia-based Republican strategist. \u201cOnly strong candidates and relentless campaigns can even hope to seize the common sense mantle like Trump and Youngkin have done so effectively.\u201d",
      "Though Mamdani ran a strong campaign in his own right, with his finger on the pulse of an electorate that was deeply concerned about cost of living, there was another important ingredient in his victory: His top opponents were hamstrung by serious personal baggage.",
      "Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, his main rival, resigned the governorship in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations. Mayor Eric Adams faced a corruption indictment and then had it dropped by the Trump administration, which soured his political standing in a deep-blue city.",
      "One of the most telling data points from Tuesday\u2019s elections was that Democrat Jay Jones won his race for Virginia attorney general \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t close.",
      "Just weeks earlier, Jones\u2019 campaign seemed doomed after reporting about violent texts from 2022 in which he suggested that Virginia\u2019s then-Republican House speaker get \u201ctwo bullets to the head.\u201d Another text from Jones discussed violence against that lawmaker\u2019s children.",
      "But partisanship trumped past transgressions. About 8 in 10 voters who called those texts disqualifying voted for Miyares, and almost the same share of voters who felt the texts were not a concern voted for Jones, the NBC News Exit Poll shows.",
      "Democratic voters told NBC News ahead of Election Day that while they strongly objected to those texts, they voted for him anyway to give Spanberger an ally to help achieve her policy goals.",
      "Then there\u2019s California, and the curious case of voters tut-tutting about partisan redistricting \u2014 while approving partisan redistricting.",
      "Fully 92% of California voters said a nonpartisan commission should draw each state\u2019s congressional district lines. Yet a majority of those people voted to approve the new maps that sidestepped the independent redistricting commission."

In the race\u2019s final weeks, she crafted a \u201ccommonsense\u201d theme that seemed intended to mimic parts of Youngkin\u2019s winning formula in 2021.",
      "Earle-Sears also frequently praised Trump and his policies on the campaign trail, even though the president never even offered a formal endorsement. Trump held a tele-rally for Virginia's Republican candidates Monday night but never mentioned Earle-Sears by name.",
      "In her concession speech, Earle-Sears acknowledged that many watching the race had long ago \"counted me out\" but that \"we kept plugging and plugging.\"",
      "She also noted that Spanberger \"ran as a moderate.\"",
      "\"If she governs as one, then she will unite us, and she'll heal our divides and win our support,\" Earle-Sears said.",
      "Spanberger, a former CIA officer, flipped a Republican-held House seat in 2018 and established herself as a more moderate Democrat, an image she cultivated during her campaign for governor.",
      "She attracted a crowd of big-name Democrats \u2014 and potential 2028 presidential candidates \u2014 to campaign with and for her in the state, helping to punctuate her anti-Trump message in the closing days of the race.",
      "While Spanberger held key advantages, she was also forced to navigate a series of issues that threatened to upend the final stretch of the race.",
      "Those included the federal government shutdown that began on Oct. 1, the emergence of violent text messages sent by Jay Jones, the Democratic attorney general nominee sharing the ballot with Spanberger, and a last-minute redistricting effort by Virginia Democratic lawmakers.",
      "Spanberger this year had seized on the move by Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to shrink the federal workforce. And when the shutdown kicked off, she leaned into blaming Trump and Earle-Sears, arguing that it was just the latest product of the chaos of a GOP-controlled Washington that has hurt Virginia, home to a large number of federal employees."

      "Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill won the New Jersey governor\u2019s race, NBC News projects, defeating Republican Jack Ciattarelli after a hard-fought contest in which President Donald Trump loomed over voters\u2019 choice.",
      "Sherrill worked to make the race a referendum on the president, casting Ciattarelli as a Trump acolyte who will not stand up to the president.",
      "Follow election live updates here",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll do whatever Trump tells him to do, and I will fight anybody to work for you,\u201d Sherrill said in their first debate in October.",
      "Trump made gains across the country in 2024, but his second-biggest gain in any state came in New Jersey. The president lost the state by 6 points last year, a 10-point improvement over his margin in the 2020 election. Now, Sherrill's victory sends a signal that Republicans can't expect those improved results from Trump to represent a straight line forward into future elections. Instead, the party is facing headwinds, as voters react to the president's handling of the economy and other issues.",
      "Following Trump's closer-than-expected finish in 2024, the New Jersey governor\u2019s race drew more than $100 million in ad spending from both parties, according to AdImpact. The contest presented an early test, ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections, of how to appeal to swingy Latino voters and navigate rising costs, especially for electricity. Democrats also looked to energize their party\u2019s core supporters, particularly Black voters, while Republicans confronted the persistent challenge of turning out Trump\u2019s supporters when he is not on the ballot.",
      "A majority of New Jersey voters (54%) disapproved of Trump\u2019s job as president and nearly two-thirds were dissatisfied or angry about the direction of the country, according to the NBC News exit poll.",
      "Trump was also a factor for a slim majority of New Jersey voters, with Sherrill winning virtually all of the 38% of voters who said their vote was to oppose Trump, while Ciattarelli won the 13% of voters who said their vote was to support Trump.",
      "Both Sherrill and Ciattarelli focused much of their campaign on the state\u2019s high cost of living, and voters said taxes, the economy and health care were among the most important issues facing the state. While Ciattarelli won over voters who said taxes were the most important issue, Sherrill won over voters who said the economy and health care were most important.",
      "Sherrill, 53, sharply criticized Trump on the campaign trail, often saying that Trump administration\u2019s policies were \u201craising costs on everything from a cup of coffee to your groceries,\u201d pledging to join a lawsuit against Trump\u2019s tariff policies on her first day in office.",
      "Ciattarelli, 63, largely praised Trump, who endorsed Ciattarelli in the GOP primary, but he also argued that the president did not have control over the state\u2019s high cost of living and high taxes.",
      "Ciattarelli, meanwhile, sought to make the race a referendum on Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy \u2014 who could not run for re-election due to term limits \u2014 and the Democrats who control state government. Ciattarelli lost a surprisingly close 3-point race to Murphy in 2021.",
      "\u201cNew Jersey, we need change,\u201d Ciattarelli said during his first debate against Sherrill, suggesting the state was facing four major crises in affordability, public education, public safety and overdevelopment.",
      "But it was not enough for Ciattarelli to pull off a win.",
      "While a slim majority of voters (51%) disapproved of Murphy\u2019s job as governor, Sherrill won over 19% of them. And 45% approved of Murphy.",
      "Sherrill also won over voters Ciattarelli was hoping to put in his column, including independents. She handily won Latino voters, despite Trump's gains in heavily Latino parts of the state last year.",
      "New Jersey also continued its historic trend of the party that controls the White House has losing eight of the state\u2019s previous 10 gubernatorial races. Sherrill, meanwhile, bucked a different historic trend, helping her party win three consecutive gubernatorial elections for the first time since 1961.",
      "Sherrill\u2019s climb to the governorship during Trump\u2019s second term comes after she was first elected to Congress in the 2018 blue wave that followed Trump\u2019s first presidential victory. In that race, when she flipped a longtime Republican House seat, Sherrill stressed her background as a Navy pilot, a former prosecutor and a mom of four kids, as she did in her campaign for governor.",
      "She won a hotly contested primary for the Democratic nomination this year, and many of Sherrill\u2019s supporters backed her because they viewed her as most likely to win and most likely to take on Trump.",
      "Sherrill\u2019s main focus on the campaign trail was on the state\u2019s high cost of living. She pledged to declare a state of emergency on utility costs on her first day in office, freezing electricity rates and then working to bring down the costs.",
      "The four-term congresswoman also pledged to fight the Trump administration over federal funding for the Gateway Tunnel Project, a massive project to add rail tunnels between New York and New Jersey. Trump recently said he canceled funding for the project amid the federal government shutdown.",
      "Sherrill was also boosted in the race by Democratic allies, with outside groups spending more than $40 million on ads casting Ciattarelli as beholden to Trump and targeting Ciattarelli\u2019s record in the state Legislature. Big-name Democratic surrogates, including some potential 2028 presidential contenders, also hit the campaign trail to support Sherrill, with former President Barack Obama rallying supporters over the weekend."

      "Democrat Jay Jones has won the election for Virginia attorney general, NBC News projects, overcoming a text message scandal that threatened to derail his candidacy in the final stretch of the race.",
      "Jones defeated Republican Jason Miyares, the incumbent who served one term.",
      "The typically low-profile race was thrust into the national spotlight after a series of violent text messages Jones sent in 2022 surfaced last month. In those texts, Jones suggested that then-Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert, a Republican, deserved \u201cbullets to the head.\u201d In the message, Jones wrote: \u201cThree people, two bullets. Gilbert, hitler, and pol pot.\u201d",
      "\u201cGilbert gets two bullets to the head,\u201d Jones said, according to the messages released by the Republican Attorneys General Association. \u201cSpoiler: put Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know and he receives both bullets every time.\u201d",
      "The messages, which were first reported by the National Review, prompted bipartisan backlash. Jones, a former state lawmaker, was not in office when he made the remarks, and he apologized to Gilbert and his family, saying in a statement, \u201cReading back those words made me sick to my stomach.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am embarrassed, ashamed, and sorry,\u201d he continued.",
      "The messages came amid a national conversation about political violence and rhetoric after the assassinations of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman, a Democrat.",
      "Republicans urged Jones to drop out of the race, while Democrats largely condemned the texts while stopping short of calling on him to end his campaign.",
      "The NBC News Exit Poll showed the text messages were on the minds of Virginia voters. Forty-five percent said they disqualified Jones for the job of attorney general.",
      "Miyares said in his concession speech that he wishes Jay Jones \u201cthe best in this new job.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know, given the circumstances of last six weeks, many of my supporters will find that difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason I wish Jay the best is because we, the people of Virginia, need it. We need an attorney general who will focus every day on keeping us safe.\u201d",
      "Jones said in his victory speech that he looked forward to sitting down with Miyares. He also thanked the outgoing attorney general \u201cfor his service to our commonwealth.\"",
      "The texts also became a focal point of the governor\u2019s race, with Republican candidate Winsome Earle-Sears pressing Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger to further reject Jones. Spanberger had said that when she learned about the messages, she \u201cspoke frankly with Jay about my disgust with what he had said and texted\u201d and \u201cmade clear to Jay that he must fully take responsibility for his words.\u201d Spanberger did not call for Jones to exit the race and declined to say whether she had withdrawn her endorsement of him, saying at a debate that \u201cit\u2019s up to voters to make a choice based on this information.\u201d",
      "Spanberger's comfortable victory over Earle-Sears in the governor's race Tuesday appears to have helped drag Jones across the finish line. With an estimated 95% of the vote in, Spanberger led by 15 points, while Jones led by 6. The NBC News Exit Poll found that 9% of Spanberger voters backed Miyares.",
      "Jones, 36, hammered a message in the blue-leaning state that Miyares would not stand up to President Donald Trump. Trump endorsed Miyares, but not Earle-Sears, in Virginia.",
      "\u201cI was held accountable,\u201d Jones said at a debate last month. \u201cBut what we have here in Virginia right now is an attorney general who won\u2019t hold the president accountable.\u201d",
      "Of the 49% of Virginia voters who strongly disapproved of the way Trump is handling his job as president, 91% voted for Jones, exit polls show.",
      "In the hours before polls opened for Election Day, Trump urged Virginians during a tele-rally to back Miyares while notably not naming Earle-Sears.",
      "\u201cGet out and vote tomorrow for Jason Miyares, very \u2014 so important \u2014 and the Republicans up and down the ballot,\u201d Trump said Monday night.",
      "Miyares, 49, began his first term in 2022, having served in the Legislature. Jones previously was an assistant attorney general in D.C. and was a Virginia state representative."

      "California voters have approved a new congressional map drawn by state Democrats, NBC News projects, giving the party the chance to gain up to five House seats in next year\u2019s midterm elections and counter Republican redistricting efforts in other states.",
      "The approval of the ballot measure allows California Democrats to temporarily circumvent the independent commission that typically controls the redistricting process and enact a more partisan map. The green light from voters will help Democrats limit, but not eliminate, the political disadvantage they\u2019re set to face in the 2026 elections after Republicans in several other states, most notably Texas, redrew maps this year to boost their party.",
      "Follow the election live here",
      "In addition to Texas, where the GOP hopes to gain an additional five House seats under new district lines, Republicans in Missouri and North Carolina have passed maps designed to net the party a new seat in each state. A mandatory redraw in Ohio could also benefit Republicans. And President Donald Trump has continued to push GOP-led states like Indiana and Kansas to help shore up the party\u2019s narrow House majority.",
      "While some Democratic governors and lawmakers are trying to redraw their maps, too, they face additional legal and procedural hurdles that aren\u2019t present in red states because many of them ceded the power to redistrict in recent years to independent or bipartisan commissions.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed hard for Democrats\u2019 redistricting plan, accusing Trump and Republicans of \u201crigging\u201d the midterms elections with their unusual decision to redraw congressional maps for explicit partisan gain outside the regular decennial cycle linked to the census. California Democrats named the bill that authorized the special election the \u201cElection Rigging Response Act,\u201d or Proposition 50, and the flurry of ads blanketing the state in support of the measure underscore that point.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump is out of control, imposing illegal tariffs that hurt our economy and denying disaster aid to California families. Now he\u2019s attempting an unprecedented power grab to steal congressional seats and rig the 2026 election. But we can stop him,\u201d a narrator says in one of the major ads from a group supporting \"yes\" on Prop 50.",
      "\u201cProp 50, the Election Rigging Response Act, thwarts Trump\u2019s scheme,\u201d the narrator continues. \u201cProp 50 levels the playing field in the midterms and gives voters the power to check Trump.",
      "There\u2019s been almost $100 million in contributions and ad spending in the race, according to campaign finance reports and data from AdImpact, a political ad tracker.",
      "Declaring victory Tuesday night, Newsom framed the result as part of a strong night for Democrats across the board and a blow to Trump.",
      "\"What a night for the Democratic Party, a party that\u2019s in its ascendency, a party that\u2019s on its toes, no longer on its heels. From coast to coast, from sea to shining sea,\" Newsom said.",
      "\"We're proud here in California to be part of this narrative this evening,\" he continued. \"We're proud of the work that the people of the state of the people of California did tonight to send a powerful message to a historic president. Donald Trump is an historic president, he is the most historically unpopular president in modern history.\"",
      "But while Republicans began saber-rattling and promised to go toe-to-toe with the Democratic efforts, the energy and spending for the campaign to defeat the ballot initiative fizzled down the stretch. The two sides were in rough parity on spending on the airwaves in the first month after the election was announced, $16 million to $17 million on either side. Then the \u201cYes\u201d side spent $63 million on ads in the final six weeks, compared with less than $16 million from the \u201cNo\u201d side."

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will weigh whether President Donald Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs on imports under a law designed for use during a national emergency.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's signature economic policy comes under Supreme Court scrutiny Wednesday as the justices weigh whether he has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs on imports under a law designed for use during a national emergency.",
      "The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority that has regularly backed Trump on various contentious cases since he took office in January, but many legal observers think the tariffs dispute is a close call.",
      "The consequences are huge for Trump and the economy at large, with Americans increasingly anxious amid signs that the tariffs are contributing to, rather than alleviating, higher costs.",
      "A new NBC News poll found that 63% of registered voters believe Trump is failing to live up to expectations on the economy, after he ran on lowering prices, in part, through tariffs. Other recent polls show a majority of Americans oppose the tariffs, which disproportionately burden small businesses.",
      "The legal question is whether a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which allows the president to regulate imports when there is an emergency, extends to the power to impose global tariffs of unspecified duration and breadth.",
      "The Constitution states that the power to set tariffs is assigned to Congress. IEEPA, which does not specifically mention tariffs, says the president can \"regulate\" imports and exports when he deems there to be an emergency, which occurs when there is an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the nation.",
      "Until Trump began his second term in January, no president had ever used the law to tariff imports. Lower courts ruled against the Trump administration, with both sides asking the Supreme Court to issue a definitive ruling.",
      "Trump has made clear how important this case is to him and his economic plan, repeatedly warning of drastic consequences if the court strikes down his tariffs. He had even suggested he would go in person to Wednesday's oral arguments, becoming the first president to do so. He later backed off that idea, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said he plans to attend.",
      "\u201cIf a President was not able to quickly and nimbly use the power of Tariffs, we would be defenseless, leading perhaps even to the ruination of our Nation,\u201d Trump said in a characteristic Truth Social post Sunday.",
      "But even if he were to lose at the Supreme Court, Trump has levied other tariffs under different laws that would survive. And his administration has been looking at other ways of imposing tariffs, although those methods are more limited.",
      "The court is hearing the case on an expedited basis, meaning a ruling could be issued in short order. It has consolidated two underlying challenges brought by small businesses and a coalition of states.",
      "V.O.S. Selections Inc., a wine and spirits importer, Plastic Services and Products, a pipe and fittings company, and two companies that sell educational toys are among the businesses that sued.",
      "The high-stakes case puts the spotlight on a court that was skeptical of President Joe Biden's unilateral use of executive power, including his attempt to forgive billions of dollars in student loan debt. The court blocked that proposal, citing what has been called the \"major questions doctrine.\"",
      "Under that theory, embraced by the conservative majority in recent years, a president cannot impose a broad policy with huge impacts on society and the economy unless Congress passes a law that specifically allows for it.",
      "The challengers said in court papers that the justices do not even need to reach the \"major questions\" question, noting that the text of IEEPA does not grant any power to impose tariffs.",
      "They pointed out that other laws, including the Trade Act, specifically grant the president the authority to levy tariffs in some form.",
      "Even if Trump could, in theory, use IEEPA for tariffs, there is no emergency that would warrant invoking it now, they added.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer, representing the Trump administration, argued in his brief that the law is written in such a way to give broad powers to the president, including over tariffs.",
      "The tariffs are necessary because of \"country-killing trade deficits,\" he added, echoing Trump's dire language.",
      "The cases concern two sets of tariffs. One is country-by-country or \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, which range from 34% for China to a 10% baseline for the rest of the world. The other is a 25% tariff Trump imposed on some goods from Canada, China and Mexico for what the administration said was their failure to curb the flow of fentanyl.",
      "Other tariffs implemented using different legal authorities, such as 50% steel and aluminum tariffs on all other worldwide trading partners, are not at issue in the case before the court.",
      "As of the end of August, IEEPA tariffs had raised about $89 billion, according to the latest data available from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. If the Supreme Court overturns those tariffs, the government would then face demands from businesses that it pay back that revenue."

      "Ahead of the film\u2019s release on Nov. 21, there are going to be multiple premieres around the world, including the first international event in the Brazilian city on Nov. 4. But a day before fans expected to see Grande, Cynthia Erivo and more cast members posing on the red carpet, the 32-year-old singer and actor announced on her Instagram story that she won\u2019t be able to attend the premiere due to a plane issue.",
      "\u201cBrazil, i can\u2019t believe this is happening and i am beyond devastated to be sending this message. a few hours ago, my team and i had to deplane our flight as they had to do maintenance on the plane due to a safety issue and it will not be taking off until 11am tomorrow which means that i would not be making it in time for the Wicked For Good S\u00e3o Paulo premiere,\u201d she began in a lengthy statement posted Nov. 3. \u201cMy team and Universal have tried every single thing possible to fix this, we\u2019ve searched every other flight, overnight, early morning, connecting flights, commercial and also private options and absolutely nothing was available or possible that would get us there in time.\u201d",

      "But it seems that some fans were not satisfied with Grande\u2019s explanation and apology. Hours before the S\u00e3o Paulo event, Grande returned to the social media platform to share another statement in which she encouraged fans to be more understanding.",
      "\u201cPlease don\u2019t wish danger on us. we did everything we could and i promise you no one is more upset than i am, i promise,\u201d she wrote in a since-deleted message on her Instagram story Nov. 4 and included a heart. \u201cNo matter how upset or disappointed you are, please please do not wish danger on us or assume that we didn\u2019t try \u2026 there was no other time for me to leave and these plans have been booked for months.\u201d",
      "She shared that she has had a busy schedule recently, balancing finishing another film and working \u201call day\u201d the past two days. Grande also added that she was scheduled to fly to Brazil the same day as co-stars Erivo and Jonathan Bailey, as well as director Jon M. Chu, but her flight issues altered their plans.",
      "\u201cSo please know how disappointed i am \u2026 sending lots of love to you all,\u201d she concluded. \u201cI hope it\u2019s a beautiful and safe night. i love Brazil, i always have, i always will.\u201d",

There will be a \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d global tour, including a  premiere in Paris on Nov. 7, one in London on Nov. 10, another in Singapore on Nov. 13 and a New York City premiere on Nov. 17.",

      "The other film Grande was referring to in her post was the upcoming sequel \u201cFocker-In-Law.\u201d She announced on Instagram Oct. 31 that she had wrapped filming for the flick, out next November. \u201cThese past few months have been so, so unimaginably special. i love my Fockers, and i love my Byrnes\u2026 so, so very much \u2661 i will miss this bunch terribly,\u201d she captioned a series of photos that showed her with a few cast members, including Ben Stiller."

      "\"So they crash into a mountain, and it becomes about them trying to survive, and slowly they wonder if they need to eat each other,\" he laughed. \"And they brought me in at some point and they wrote a new script, which was what became 'Anchorman.'\"",
      "Once they started pitching the new script, Apatow said some people had their doubts about whether Ferrell could play the lead.",
      "It wasn't until Steven Spielberg stepped in that Ferrell was able to secure his role as legendary anchor Ron Burgundy.",

      "\"But DreamWorks had just put us in turnaround, which means they weren\u2019t going to make it,\" he said of \"Anchorman.\"",

      "Thanks to that decision, \"Anchorman\" was put in production, and in 2004, it hit theaters.",
      "\u201c(Spielberg) was the reason Adam and Will were allowed to make 'Anchorman,\u2019\u201d Apatow said.",

      "\"If you were on the set of 'Anchorman,' and you were just watching the shoot, there was no one there who wasn\u2019t like, 'Steve Carell is the funniest guy ever,'\" he said.",
      "\"So just one day I\u2019m like, 'Do you have any ideas for yourself as a lead?' And then one day he told me about a sketch he worked on once about a guy who is at a poker game, and they were all talking dirty about sex, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s lying and hasn\u2019t had sex. And I thought, 'Sadly, I understand that,'\" Apatow laughed. \"I know how to develop that.\"",
      "That movie turned into Carell's breakout film \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\"",
      "When asked what advice he would give to people who are trying to get into comedy, Apatow turns to his new book, \"Comedy Nerd: A Lifelong Obsession in Stories and Pictures.\"",
      "\"Part of how I built the book is that I put all the failures in there also. So all the pilots that weren\u2019t picked up, everything that was a bomb. And I talk about how that happened. How did things fall apart? What\u2019s it like when they work? What\u2019s it like when they don\u2019t work?\" he said.",

      "Their coupling finally stuck in the final week of the show, and Nic and Olandria were voted Season 7's runners-up, just behind Amaya Espinal and Bryan Arenales.",
      "Since leaving the villa, they've experienced a whirlwind of events, interviews, sponsorship opportunities and more.",
      "\"I feel like it's been a year in the last four months with the way that things are going,\" Nic says. \"You get maybe like one breather a week, so taking those breathers a week is helpful, and that's I guess the way that I stay present.\"",
      "Just over a week before the marathon, Nic was in Miami for a launch party hosted by Celsius. There, he met up with Rob and Kendall from the show's breakout Season 6. Because they have shared \"lore,\" as Nic puts it, they didn't end up talking much about what happened during their time in \"Love Island\" villa.",
      "\"I asked Rob specifically how he's been navigating the life afterwards,\" Nic says. \"I think asking people from the last cast is so beneficial, because they've literally gone through the same thing.\"",
      "His biggest insight?",
      "\"The thing that I noticed was that Rob and Kendall just seem to be the same people they were online. And so I think the biggest takeaway is just being who you are, and if people can't accept that, then they're not your cup of tea,\" he says.",
      "When it came to balancing marathon prep with all his opportunities, Nic says finding the time to run helped quiet all the \"noise.\"",
      "\"They don't go hand in hand,\" he says of his busy schedule and training. \"But after doing the events at night it's nice to wake up early in the morning and get the run done. It's definitely a way to clear the mind.\"",
      "Nic finished his past two marathons in around five hours and 20 minutes, \"so I think hopefully that'll be pretty easy to beat,\" he says.",
      "\"That's the goal ... under five hours would be great,\" he adds.",
      "After the race and into November, he says he and Olandria will have a \"lot more downtime.\"",
      "\"I think at this point we're looking for just a breath of a fresh air from all the hectic-ness,\" he says.",
      "\"I've said this before, like I want to go on our hot air balloon date, I want to do all these things \u2014\u00a0but at this point, I'm like, I just want to sit on a couch and do nothing with her,\" he adds. \"That sounds elite.\""

      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be very ugly because I always try to do something different,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought last year, I was very cute with my husband as E.T. And the year before that, we were the big peacock with performers.\u201d",
      "Klum\u2019s joint peacock costume with her husband, musician Tom Kaulitz, required 15 additional people to navigate. She felt the need to create that more \u201ccomplicated\u201d costume, she told People, because her creepy worm costume in 2022 \u201cfelt so simple.\u201d",

      "Her costume was inspired by the makeover E.T. gets from his young friend Gertie, played by Drew Barrymore, who was just 7 when \u201cE.T.\u201d was released. As in the movie, Klum\u2019s E.T. sported a long blond wig, red lipstick and a black hat and scarf.",

      "The look elicited many strong reactions online, with some social media users calling it \"disrespectful.\"",
      "On Instagram, Fox revealed why she chose the look for Halloween.",
      "\"I\u2019m dressed as Jackie Kennedy in the pink suit. Not as a costume, but as a statement,\" she said. \"When her husband was assassinated, she refused to change out of her blood-stained clothes, saying, \u2018I want them to see what they\u2019ve done.\u2019 The image of the delicate pink suit splattered with blood is one of the most haunting juxtapositions in modern history.\"",
      "\"Beauty and horror. Poise and devastation. Her decision not to change clothes, even after being encouraged to, was an act of extraordinary bravery,\" Fox continued. \"It was performance, protest, and mourning all at once. A woman weaponizing image and grace to expose brutality. It\u2019s about trauma, power, and how femininity itself is a form of resistance. Long live Jackie O \u2665\ufe0f.\"",
      "Fox wore the outfit at the annual Cursed Amulet Halloween party in New York City.",

      "The National Archives has kept the pink suit preserved in a climate-controlled vault outside of Washington, per The New York Times.",
      "The suit won't be available for public viewing until the year 2103 as to not \"dishonor the memory of Mrs. Kennedy or President Kennedy, or cause any grief or suffering to members of their family,\" according to a deed of the suit from when it was gifted to the National Archives."

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukrainian troops have launched helicopter raids and counteroffensives to try and ease the pressure on a key eastern city, as the Kremlin seeks a crucial battlefield victory with the U.S. push for peace shelved.",
      "Street battles were being fought in Pokrovsk, a transport and supply hub whose capture could serve as a springboard for the Russian military to threaten bigger nearby cities. It would also hand Vladimir Putin new leverage at a delicate diplomatic moment, with the Russian leader set on capturing the entirety of the broader Donetsk region.",
      "Putin's forces have been battling to take Pokrovsk for more than a year, but now appear on the verge of a breakthrough with the front lines in the city increasingly blurred.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that Ukrainian troops should surrender to save themselves, claiming they were \"trapped\" by Russian forces in the city, which was once home to some 60,000 people but is now largely deserted and destroyed.",
      "It said that Russian troops were advancing further northward into Pokrovsk, blocking multiple Ukrainian attempts to break out of encirclement.",
      "Ukraine has rejected the idea that its troops were encircled. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited troops Tuesday in nearby Dobropillia, where Ukrainian forces are staging a counteroffensive to try and draw Russia\u2019s focus.",
      "NBC News could not independently verify the battlefield accounts from either side.",
      "However, Ukrainian military officials and soldiers on the ground have conceded that the situation in Pokrovsk is increasingly challenging.",
      "\u201cThe situation is difficult,\u201d Sgt. Liana Kononchuk of the Ukrainian unit operating in Pokrovsk, told NBC News via WhatsApp this week. \u201cWe are trying to control it. But, unfortunately, it has only been getting worse lately,\u201d the 31-year-old said.",
      "\u201cAs of now there is no permanent line of defense as such,\u201d she said. \u201cThe enemy seeps northwards by one, two, three units at a time, thereby trying to erode the frontline,\u201d Kononchuk added.",
      "Her comments match the assessment of the Ukrainian open-source mapping project Deep State. Its latest map showed that Russian forces had pushed further into the city from the south but that most of the area remained a contested gray zone controlled by neither side.",
      "Ukraine has deployed additional resources in a bid to hold back the Russian assault, including a special forces operation using U.S.-made Black Hawk helicopters to restore supply routes, according to a spokesperson for the 7th Rapid Response Corps that is leading the defensive effort.",
      "Kononchuk hopes that these reinforcements will stabilize the situation. \u201cThe logistics situation is now very complicated. Rotating positions is hard, and evacuating the wounded is even harder,\u201d she said.",
      "The Ukrainian commander overseeing defense of the city, Col. Yevhen Lasiichuk, said via WhatsApp on Monday that Moscow\u2019s claims of an encirclement were false and part of Russia\u2019s propaganda \u201cgame.\u201d",
      "Lasiichuk said that there were between 200 and 300 Russian soldiers inside the city.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to push through the town to block key logistic points,\u201d he added.",
      "Lasiichuk stressed that, although complicated, Ukraine was still able to reach its troops in Pokrovsk.",
      "\u201cOur Defense Forces units have recently carried out airborne landings,\u201d he said. \u201cThis certainly does not look like an encirclement.\u201d",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday that its troops had repelled a Ukrainian special forces landing and killed all 11 soldiers who arrived by helicopter.",
      "Influential Russian military bloggers have reported the heavy use of drones and smaller mobile units to disrupt Ukrainian defenses.",
      "While the exact situation on the ground remained unclear, military analysts said that losing Pokrovsk would be a bitter blow for Ukraine as it pushes for greater U.S. support.",
      "\"The loss of Pokrovsk would make Ukrainian logistics on this front complicated, increase the risk of losing or retreating from nearby positions, and require a restructuring of the defensive lines,\" Viktor Kevliuk, a retired Ukrainian colonel now working for the Kyiv-based Center for Defense Strategies, said in an interview.",
      "Pokrovsk would be Russia\u2019s most important territorial gain since it took the eastern city of Avdiivka in early 2024. Its capture could cause a \u201cdomino effect,\u201d but would still be a limited strategic gain unlikely to shift the overall balance of the war, Kevliuk said.",
      "Other experts said it could bolster Putin's bargaining hand after Trump called off a planned summit and imposed new sanctions on Russia last month.",
      "\"Moscow could also try to use any battlefield gains to pressure Ukraine at the negotiating table and persuade Trump to accept Russia\u2019s terms,\" Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, said in an interview.",
      "\u201cUkraine is in a difficult position. Politically, it is hard to withdraw from territory \u2014 especially when the enemy is trying to turn local military successes into broader strategic and diplomatic victories,\u201d said Bielieskov, who is also a senior analyst at Come Back Alive, a Ukrainian nongovernmental organization.",
      "But, he said, in practical terms keeping hold of the area was now \u201cextremely challenging.\u201d",
      "Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv, and Elmira Aliieva from London."

      "The summit could be held after joint U.S.-South Korea military drills that are scheduled for March, said Lee, speaking after a briefing by the NIS. North Korea often criticizes such drills as rehearsals for invasion, which the U.S. and South Korea deny.",

      "A White House official said there were no meetings to announce at this time.",
      "\u201cU.S. policy on North Korea has not changed. President Trump remains open to talking with Kim Jong Un, without any preconditions,\u201d the official said.",
      "Trump and Kim met three times during Trump\u2019s first term as president, most recently in 2019, but denuclearization talks collapsed amid disagreements over U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea.",
      "Since then, Kim has advanced his ballistic missile and nuclear programs and gained leverage through a security partnership with Russia that has included sending artillery and troops to aid Moscow in its war on Ukraine.",
      "Kim and other North Korean officials have said repeatedly that they are not willing to negotiate with the U.S. unless Washington agrees to accept it as a nuclear power, with Pyongyang on Saturday dismissing the idea of denuclearization as a \u201cpipe dream.\u201d",
      "Kim has also rebuffed overtures from South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, who favors greater engagement with the North than his conservative predecessor. Lee told the United Nations General Assembly in September that he was seeking a \u201cphased solution\u201d to the North Korean nuclear issue, \u201cbased on a cool-headed perception that denuclearization cannot be achieved in the short term.\u201d",
      "Ahead of Trump\u2019s Asia trip there was speculation that he might meet with Kim, and Trump said he was willing to extend his five-day trip in order to schedule such a meeting.",

Their three daughters, they believed, were being brainwashed by public school and mainstream media to support LGBTQ rights. American culture in general no longer offered white people the same opportunities as other races, they said.",
      "The couple yearned to live in a place that shared their \"Christian values\" and where they \"weren't going to be discriminated against\" as white, politically-conservative Christians.",
      "So in March, the Huffmans became the first family to move to a community planned for fellow English-speakers some 30 miles west of Moscow, a project they had been following online run by long-term American expat and former Kremlin-sponsored RT host Tim Kirby. The family is among a small but growing number of Americans who have moved to Russia because the United States, in their opinion, has become too \u201cwoke.\"",
      "The Russian government has welcomed these culture war refugees. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin issued an executive order offering temporary residence to people wanting to move to the country because they rejected \"destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes\" of their home countries.",
      "Around 1,500 of these \u201cideological immigrants,\u201d as they\u2019ve been dubbed by the Russian media, including 127 Americans, have applied for temporary residence in Russia, according to the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs.",
      "\"President Putin is an amazing leader and he\u2019s done great things for Russia,\u201d Derek Huffman, 45, said in a video on his family\u2019s YouTube channel on March 9. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like you see on the news.\u201d The social media platform X \u201cis the only place where you get real information\" about America's own problems, Derek says.",
      "The family initially found a community of Russians and westerners on social media who encouraged their move, with donations from some of their 15,000 YouTube subscribers providing financial support after their arrival in Russia. But when Derek Huffman voluntarily joined the Russian army in May, the family became a lightning rod for broader online scrutiny.",
      "Derek Huffman said he joined the Russian army to expedite the family\u2019s applications for Russian citizenship, as well as to show support for their new homeland.",
      "\u201cAbove and beyond the citizenship, the money, a big part of it for me is about the respect and earning our place here in Russia,\u201d he said on the Huffmans\u2019 YouTube channel on May 26.",
      "But in a follow-up video posted in June, which was subsequently deleted, DeAnna Huffman, 42, told viewers that her husband had been \u201cthrown to the wolves.\u201d NBC News viewed a re-upload of the video.",
      "The couple had hoped Derek Huffman would put previous welding experience to use in the repair battalion and \u201cactually be utilized for his skills,\u201d she said in the video. Instead, she said, he was sent to the front line and struggled to understand his training, which was in Russian.",
      "Pro-Ukrainian commentators, keen to publicize hardship for pro-Russian figures, said on social media that Derek Huffman had been killed. A post on X claiming to have access to drone footage of his death has more than 2 million views. NBC News did not find video to substantiate the claim, and DeAnna Huffman denied the reports.",
      "Derek reappeared in several videos on the family\u2019s YouTube channel uploaded on October 25, celebrating his daughter\u2019s birthday and signing forms to receive his Russian passport.",
      "In one filmed in the family\u2019s neighborhood, he said he was back \u201con vacation\u201d after being deployed for six months, and praised his wife for keeping the family going while he was gone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that I\u2019m still alive and doing what I can to survive, and be of service to Russia. I\u2019m so thankful to all the Russian people who have reached out and helped my family while I\u2019ve been gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Another family, the Hares, also moved from Abilene, Texas, to Russia to shield their three sons from what they say are harmful elements of American culture.",
      "\u201cIt was the promise of a country that would not promote the LGBT agenda. We liked the fact that LGBT is basically outlawed here in official ways,\u201d Leo Hare, 62, told NBC News via a video call from the family\u2019s new home in Ivanovo, Russia.",
      "Russia has strict laws against the \u201cpromotion of nontraditional sexual relationships,\u201d which have in practice banned public displays of LGBTQ identity, including wearing or posting the rainbow flag on social media.",
      "His wife Chantelle Hare, 53, says in a video on the family's own YouTube channel that when they lived the U.S., she and her husband preferred to get their news from Alex Jones and Mike Adams, who are far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists. They felt particularly disillusioned with American politics after the 2020 election, and don\u2019t believe Donald Trump\u2019s return to power will change the country enough to convince them to return.",
      "\u201cWhen we left, it was final. We don\u2019t plan to come back. There will not be anything to come back to,\u201d Chantelle Hare said.",
      "The Hares have endured their share of hardship trying to build a new life in Russia.",
      "They say their initial plan to rent an apartment in Moscow fell through just as they boarded the plane from Texas, and the family spent a bitterly cold winter caring for chickens, horses and rabbits on a farm 70 miles south of Moscow in exchange for free board. At one point, they even had to bring the goats and their newborns inside their cabin to keep the animals from dying.",
      "Leo Hare thought their troubles were over when their landlord\u2019s son offered a generous interest rate for investing their $50,000 nest egg in what he described as a car import business. But they only saw one payment before he stopped sending them money and refused to return their money, Leo Hare said.",
      "The couple went to the police and the local court to file complaints about their lost money and with their concerns that they had been swindled, but say they have received no help from law enforcement officials. NBC News contacted Domodedovo police for comment but did not receive a reply.",
      "The Hares\u2019 sons, 17, 15, and 12, have had difficulty adapting to life in Russia, and the two older boys want to return to America, according to their father. They feel isolated and are disappointed that school is not an option since Russia requires students to pass a language test to study in public schools.",
      "Leo and Chantelle, who ran a carpet cleaning business and a mobile snack business back in the U.S., are now working as English tutors. They have found an apartment in Ivanovo, northeast of Moscow, and \u201care living really comfortably now.\u201d They are currently homeschooling their children. Leo Hare said it probably \u201cwould have been a dealbreaker\u201d if they knew about the school restrictions.",
      "The Hares have not met the Huffmans.",
      "Leo Hare says he never considered joining the army because of his age and safety concerns, and says that Derek Huffman \u201cassumed a little too much\u201d about life in the Russian military.",
      "\"We assumed a lot, too,\" he admitted. \"But we do have a faith in Christ and He is leading us, even though we\u2019ve made mistakes.\""

    "story": [
      "GIZA, Egypt \u2014 They\u2019re the crown jewels of the Grand Egyptian Museum \u2014 two galleries devoted to the ancient pharaoh Tutankhamun.",
      "Showcasing more than 5,300 objects from the young king\u2019s tomb, including his iconic death mask and glittering royal regalia, the new section of the vast museum here on the outskirts of Cairo is expected to draw millions of visitors every year.",
      "The galleries, displaying mostly pieces never seen by the public, were officially opened in an elaborate and long-awaited grand opening ceremony on Saturday in front of delegates from more than 70 countries.",
      "On a behind-the-scenes visit to the museum\u2019s Conservation Center earlier this month, general director Hussein Kamal told NBC News that it will be the first time since Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered over a century ago that all the items are stored in one place.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said, adding that he was particularly excited by the exhibition featuring King Tut\u2019s armor. The piece made from textiles and leather was \u201cunique throughout ancient Egyptian civilization,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamal said the items, previously held in a storeroom, were painstakingly restored since 2017 by some of the center\u2019s 150 conservators.",
      "\u201cWe tried to reshape it from the original,\u201d he said, adding that it was a challenge because they did not have anything to compare it to and had to depend on \u201cinvestigation and analysis to know the original structure of the armor.\u201d",
      "Believed to have become pharaoh when he was 8 or 9 years old, in around 1334 B.C., Tutankhamun ruled until his death 10 years later. He is believed to have suffered from numerous illnesses and disabilities, including circulatory problems, malaria, bone disease and a club foot.",
      "Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in November 1922 in the Valley of the Kings by the British archaeologist Howard Carter, undisturbed by grave robbers and almost completely intact, nearly 400 miles south of Egypt\u2019s most famous archeological treasures in Giza.",
      "Now the artifacts recovered from that tomb will sit in the largest museum in the world dedicated to a single civilization \u2014 the Grand Egyptian Museum's grounds cover 117 acres, or the equivalent of 80 football fields, just over a mile north of the Great Pyramids of Giza outside Cairo.",
      "The collection also includes the 4,000-year-old funerary boat, also known as the Cheops ship, of Pharaoh Khufu.",
      "At Saturday's grand opening, attended by a number of European and Arab leaders, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi sought to give the event an international scale, calling on attendees to \"make this museum a platform for dialogue, a destination for knowledge, a forum for humanity, and a beacon for all who love life and believe in the value of humankind.\"",
      "With the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx as their backdrop, actors dressed in ancient Egyptian garb paid tribute to thousands of years of history, as an orchestra played fanfares. Hundreds of drones created a light show in the sky, depicting figures including Tutankhamun and ancient Egyptian gods Isis and Osiris.",
      "While the museum will officially open Tuesday, limited tours have been available since 2023, and the public is allowed access to most of its main galleries since October.",
      "Hassan Allam, CEO of the museum's management company, said daily visitor numbers would surge from 6,000 to 15,000 this week as the doors are opened on the \"out of this world\" Tutankhamun Gallery.",
      "He said running the museum had been a \"challenging and yet wonderful experience,\" describing it as a \"great privilege\" to \"play a small role in Egypt's history, maintaining it, managing it, and hosting Egyptology lovers from across the world.\"",
      "Alongside the Tutankhamun exhibition, the museum holds artifacts from the prehistoric era, dating from 700,000 B.C., to the Roman era of the fourth century A.D., arranged around themes of kingship, society and beliefs.",
      "Statues, sarcophagi and stelae also offer a glimpse into the life of Egypt\u2019s ancient elite and how they prepared themselves for the afterlife.",
      "At the museum\u2019s center sits the six-story Grand Staircase with a view of the pyramids and an atrium containing monuments, pharaonic statues and sarcophagi.",
      "The opening ceremony marks the culmination of a project first announced in 1992. Construction officially began in 2005 and has been hit by repeated delays due to the Arab Spring in the early 2010s and the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Ahmed Ezz, the chairman of Ezz Steel, which provided all of the steel rebar needed for the project, said in an interview this week that the museum not only reflects his country\u2019s past but is \u201calso part of an architectural renaissance of Egypt.\u201d",
      "After a \u201cdifficult decade,\u201d Ezz said he hoped the museum would show that his country was \u201cgoing on a more positive trajectory.\u201d"

      "Such incidents have occurred almost daily near populated areas, mainly in the mountainous north. They've taken place near supermarkets, bus stations, schools and even a hot springs resort, prompting local officials to issue safety rules urging residents to stay indoors after dark and steer clear of dense woodland.",
      "With local authorities struggling to cope, the military has now stepped in at their request.",
      "\u201cWe recognize that the harm caused by bears is in a critical situation in Akita Prefecture,\u201d military commander Yasunori Matsunaga said Wednesday during a signing ceremony between the defense ministry and authorities in the northern region.",
      "\u201cStarting today, we will begin carrying out our mission while taking various needs into consideration,\u201d he said.",
      "Armed with bear spray and shields, troops from the country's Self Defense Force will help carry and set steel-barred box traps to capture the bears, transport local hunters who then shoot them and help dispose of the bodies.",
      "Kenta Suzuki, governor of Akita Prefecture, said the first deployment would be in Kazuno city. \u201cI would like to once again express my heartfelt gratitude to all members of the Self-Defense Forces.\u201d",
      "The operation will be gradually extended to other municipalities until the end of the month, according to city officials.",
      "Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said the troops were intervening \"to protect the lives and livelihoods\" of residents given the unique situation. But he made clear that the SDF's primary mission is national defense, meaning \"we cannot involve ourselves in bear countermeasures indefinitely.\"",
      "On Tuesday, a 77-year-old man sustained injuries near his right eye and right hand whiled delivering newspapers in the city of Akita. A 79-year-old woman was found dead on Monday in the woods of Akita Prefecture after a bear attack, police said.",
      "Bears have attacked more than 50 people since May in the broader Akita Prefecture, killing at least four, according to the local government. The area is home to some 880,000 people.",
      "\u201cThe townspeople feel the danger every day,\u201d Kazuno Mayor Shinji Sasamoto said after meeting 15 or so soldiers who rolled into town in an army truck and jeeps, equipped with body armour and a large map.",
      "\u201cIt has affected how people live their lives, forcing them to stop going out or cancel events,\u201d Sasamoto said, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Japan is home to two main types of bears, the Asiatic black bear and the Hokkaido brown bear.",
      "Experts believe that a combination of a growing bear population in Japan, people moving to cities from rural areas and fewer hunters due to an aging population have all played a role in the increasing number of incidents.",
      "Climate change has also been cited as a factor because of its effect on food supply and hibernation patterns.",
      "Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, and Peter Guo from Hong Kong."

      "The Kospi stock index in South Korea plunged more than 6% at its lowest point. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 average slid about 4.5%, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index tumbled more than 1%. Stocks in Taiwan also fell around 2.5%.",

      "U.S. stock futures, an indication of where markets will open, showed that losses were likely to continue Wednesday after the opening bell rings in New York. S&P 500 futures pointed to a drop of 0.5%, and Nasdaq futures indicated a decline of about 1% on Wednesday.",
      "While Asian markets pared some of their losses from earlier in the day, the indices closed lower across the board, which economists said was an indicator of how reliant tech companies, even in Asia, are on the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere are some Asian economies \u2014 Taiwan the most, followed by South Korea \u2014 that are really dependent on U.S. tech companies,\u201d said Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong.",

      "The selloff came after a day of significant selling in the United States that brought the recent global market rally to a halt. The S&P 500 closed Tuesday down 1.1%, the Nasdaq tumbled 2%, and the Russell 2000 fell 1.8%.",
      "The largest publicly traded company in the world, Nvidia, dropped nearly 4% on Tuesday. Palantir, another AI firm whose business involves government contracts, sank nearly 8% even after it beat Wall Street\u2019s earnings expectations.",

      "Last week, the Kospi hit a record high, fueled by gains in AI stocks. Taiwan\u2019s benchmark index, TWI, has gained 20% this year, driven in part by the 40% gain seen by TSMC, which supplies chips to Nvidia and other tech companies.",
      "But on Wednesday, the months-long rally came to a grinding halt after overvaluation warnings from Wall Street, resulting in a steep selloff, with shares of global electronics giant Samsung falling 5.5% and chipmaker SK Hynix dropping more than 6%.",
      "SoftBank, a major investor in AI firms, sank more than 14%, wiping out more than $30 billion in market value.",

Matters were made worse by lackluster earnings Tuesday afternoon from Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer, both of which manufacture chips used for AI services.",

Companies from Amazon to Microsoft to OpenAI have announced a steady stream of multibillion-dollar deals with one another, raising questions over the sustainability of the industry and its sources of funding.",
      "U.S. stocks are coming off a remarkable run, repeatedly setting recent record highs. For the year so far, the S&P 500 is still up more than 15%. The Nasdaq Composite, which more closely tracks the largest tech companies, has still gained more than 20% this year.",

      "\"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" he said.",

We\u2019re going to kill them. They\u2019re going to be, like, dead.\"",
      "Also last month, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a request to obtain the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel's guidance on the strikes.",
