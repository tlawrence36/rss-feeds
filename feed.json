      "Eddie Palmieri, the pioneering rumba and Latin jazz musician, has died at 88",
      "Eddie Palmieri, the avant-garde musician who was one of the most innovative artists of rumba and Latin jazz, has died. He was 88.",
      "Fania Records announced Palmieri's death Wednesday evening. Palmieri\u2019s daughter Gabriela told The New York Times that her father died earlier that day at his home in New Jersey after \u201can extended illness.\u201d",
      "The pianist, composer and bandleader was the first Latino to win a Grammy Award and would win seven more over a career that spanned nearly 40 albums.",
      "Palmieri was born in New York\u2019s Spanish Harlem on December 15, 1936, at a time when music was seen as a way out of the ghetto. He began studying the piano at an early age, like his famous brother Charlie Palmieri, but at age 13, he began playing timbales in his uncle\u2019s orchestra, overcome with a desire for the drums.",
      "He eventually abandoned the instrument and went back to the playing piano. \u201cI\u2019m a frustrated percussionist, so I take it out on the piano,\u201d the musician once said in his website biography.",
      "His first Grammy win came in 1975 for the album \u201cThe Sun of Latin Music,\u201d and he kept releasing music into his 80s, performing through the coronavirus pandemic via livestreams.",
      "In a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, when asked if he had anything important left to do, he responded with his usual humility and good humor: \u201cLearning to play the piano well. ... Being a piano player is one thing. Being a pianist is another.\u201d",
      "Palmieri dabbled in tropical music as a pianist during the 1950s with the Eddie Forrester Orchestra. He later joined Johnny Segu\u00ed\u2019s band and Tito Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s before forming his own band in 1961, La Perfecta, alongside trombonist Barry Rogers and singer Ismael Quintana.",
      "La Perfecta was the first to feature a trombone section instead of trumpets, something rarely seen in Latin music. With its unique sound, the band quickly joined the ranks of Machito, Tito Rodr\u00edguez, and other Latin orchestras of the time.",
      "Palmieri produced several albums on the Alegre and Tico Records labels, including the 1971 classic \u201cV\u00e1monos pa\u2019l monte,\u201d with his brother Charlie as guest organist. Charlie Palmieri died in 1988.",
      "Eddie's unconventional approach would surprise critics and fans again that year with the release of \u201cHarlem River Drive,\u201d in which he fused Black and Latin styles to produce a sound that encompassed elements of salsa, funk, soul and jazz.",
      "Later, in 1974, he recorded \u201cThe Sun of Latin Music\u201d with a young Lalo Rodr\u00edguez. The album became the first Latin production to win a Grammy.",
      "The following year he recorded the album \u201cEddie Palmieri & Friends in Concert, Live at the University of Puerto Rico,\u201d considered by many fans to be a salsa gem.",

      "Palmieri released the album \u201cMasterpiece\u201d in 2000, which teamed him with the legendary Tito Puente, who died that year. It was a hit with critics and won two Grammy Awards.

      "During his long career, he participated in concerts and recordings with the Fania All-Stars and Tico All-Stars, standing out as a composer, arranger, producer, and orchestra director.",
      "In 1988, the Smithsonian Institute recorded two of Palmieri\u2019s concerts for the catalog of the National Museum of American History in Washington.",
      "Yale University in 2002 awarded him the Chubb Fellowship Award, an award usually reserved for international heads of state, in recognition of his work in building communities through music.",
      "In 2005, he made his debut on National Public Radio as the host of the program \u201cCaliente,\u201d which was carried by more than 160 radio stations nationwide.",

      "In 2010, Palmieri said he felt a bit lonely musically due to the deaths of many of the rumberos with whom he enjoyed playing with.",

      "Ryan Speedo Green has taken on the challenging role of Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre\u201d at the Santa Fe Opera House",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre.\u201d",
      "Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge.",
      "And indeed the part of Wotan, one of the most demanding roles in opera for a dramatic bass-baritone, seems to inspire mountain imagery. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it \u201cthe Mount Everest for this particular voice type.\u201d To Green, \u201cIt feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.\u201d",
      "Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he\u2019s come.",
      "Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star.",
      "\u201cI never thought it would happen, that my career would blow up the way it has,\u201d Green said in an interview between performances, which continue through Aug. 21.",
      "The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre,\u201d the second of the four operas in Wagner\u2019s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods.",
      "It calls for a wide dramatic range \u2014 from exuberance, to despair, from fury to compassion. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Br\u00fcnnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson.",
      "\u201cMy Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I\u2019m getting my first whack at it at 39.\u201d",

      "\u201cGreen \u2026 portrayed the troubled god as if he had been doing it for years,\u201d wrote Harvey Steiman on Seen and Heard International. \u201cSensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s extremely hard on himself,\u201d said Gaffigan, who is conducting the Santa Fe performances and recalled the first time he heard from Green after he was cast.",
      "\u201cHe called me to start discussing the role before he even got to Santa Fe,\u201d Gaffigan said, \u201cAnd from the first words on the telephone, he said, \u2018I want an hour for Act 2 and an hour for Act 3, can you give me that?\u2019 \u2026 I knew this guy was really serious and he wouldn\u2019t give up on getting this time.",

This is a strange shortcoming considering the caliber of the cast, including Thomas as the bride to be, and Sienna Miller, Emily Beecham and Scarlett Johansson as her daughters. But it\u2019s a cruel reminder that a good hook, talented actors, one killer monologue and a picturesque setting (in this case, the English countryside) aren\u2019t guarantees that a movie will work.",
      "In the film, the deaths may be in the distant past, but they continue to haunt Diana\u2019s (Thomas) adult daughters as she prepares to marry another. Diana\u2019s new man is not a dashing pilot, forever preserved in handsome youth. Geoffrey (James Fleet) is very gray. He likes to talk about birds, ospreys in particular, has never had children and comes with a very silly last name (Loveglove) that she plans to take. Her girls are not exactly impressed, though they\u2019ve all got their own stuff to deal with.",
      "It should be said that Johansson is indeed playing a British woman in this film, and while I don't feel qualified to comment on the nuances of her accent, all I can say is that there is a consistently strange disconnect to hear it coming out of her mouth. Johansson is a great actor who I\u2019ve believed in many wilder roles, from Marvel movies right on down to her Ellen Greene riff during \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d 50th anniversary show. But, somehow, she\u2019s hard to buy as Katherine Frost: A British, lesbian Royal Navy officer in a longtime relationship with a woman named Jack (played by fellow beauty Freida Pinto).",
      "Miller\u2019s character is Victoria, a Hollywood actor known for franchise dreck (no one can remember whether the latest \u201cDame Of Darkness\u201d is the fourth or fifth in the series) and short-lived relationships. And Beecham is the youngest Georgina, a nurse who suspects that her husband is having an affair. To find out, the girls hire a private detective to surveil her house and show them the footage after the wedding.",
      "It's a very busy, fraught weekend for everyone. There\u2019s lots of fretting over why Katherine won\u2019t marry Jack, and why Victoria is dancing around a relationship with a wealthy, older French man when her childhood crush still pines for her. There\u2019s lingering anxiety about their mom marrying this man who seems so unlike the two heroes that came before and much discussion about the importance of last names, marriage and making sure kids feel like they belong to someone. Some things get resolved, but it's hard to shake the feeling that everyone might need a new therapist by the end.",

      "Zach Cregger says he had to stop writing jokes while creating his latest horror film, \u201cWeapons,\" and instead let the hyper realistic aftermath of tragedy drive the movie's humor",
      "LOS ANGELES -- If there\u2019s one thing Zach Cregger learned while writing and directing his upcoming horror movie \u201cWeapons,\u201d it\u2019s that the best laughs won\u2019t come from the jokes he writes.",
      "The film follows Cregger\u2019s 2022 solo directorial debut \u201cBarbarians,\u201d the widely celebrated genre-bending horror. This time, the young director bends even more, spinning a town into chaos when all children but one from the same classroom mysteriously vanish, leaving a trail of questions in their place.",
      "The Warner Bros. release hits theaters Friday and is as creepy as it is hilarious \u2014 a delicate balance that required Cregger to strip any intentionality behind his humor, he told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIf the humor is coming from an authentic reaction that a character\u2019s having, then it works,\u201d Cregger said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of jokes that didn\u2019t make it into the movie that I thought were going to be so funny. And then we did a test screening, and nobody laughed and I\u2019m like, OK, it\u2019s gotta go.\u201d",
      "Paranoia runs deep in the film. The town's heartbroken parents are represented by Josh Brolin\u2019s character, Archer, whose son was among the missing. The students\u2019 teacher, played by Julia Garner, is determined to solve the mystery, despite parents blaming her for the disappearances.",
      "The humor here comes naturally, Cregger said, as characters navigate the absurd events happening around them.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not playing for the laugh, otherwise you lose the laugh,\u201d said Brolin, whose character stumbles through his grief, a state ripe for what he called genuine and \u201cembarrassingly funny\u201d moments.",
      "If 17 kids up and ran out of their homes at 2:17 a.m. one morning with no trace, what would a community do? That question drove \u201cWeapons,\u201d painting a picture of a town left reeling by the mystery.",
      "The film setting \u2014 the fictional small town of Maybrook, Illinois \u2014 is just as integral to the plot as any of its main characters. The town feels hyper realistic, a core tenet to the movie\u2019s ability to blend humor and horror, two genres that Garner said are \u201copposite side of the same coin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny because this isn\u2019t even like a proper horror film,\u201d Garner said. \u201cIt has comedic elements and has horror elements, but it\u2019s kind of its own genre, in a way.\u201d",
      "The town\u2019s reactions to tragedy and shock was intentionally meant to feel oddly realistic, Cregger said. Parents are outraged, storming into town halls and angrily demanding answers from the police, the school and, most pointedly, the students\u2019 teacher. Yet, when Garner\u2019s character is attacked in broad daylight, bystanders and store owners hardly bat an eye, a level of indifference that Cregger said is just as realistic as the parental outrage.",

      "The body-swappers are back",
      "It\u2019s a tale as old as time \u2014 or at least, a tale Hollywood loves to tell again and again: Body-swapping. It\u2019s magical. It\u2019s comical. It carries heartwarming messages about walking in another\u2019s shoes, and learning about oneself along the way.",
      "So it\u2019s hardly surprising that \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d the 2003 version of the 1972 Mary Rodgers novel starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, was a hit. Lohan was endearing and charismatic as an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager, and Curtis was a comic hoot as her control-freak therapist mom.",
      "And while there were a few misfires \u2014 the stereotypical Asian representation has aged badly \u2014 the film was powered by an easy chemistry between the two stars. So why not revisit the story in 2025? Sequels are often made for far less compelling reasons.",
      "The chief weakness of \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d \u2014 which brings Curtis and Lohan back for an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion \u2014 is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante. The comedy is thus a bit more manic, and the plot machinations more overwrought (or sometimes distractingly silly).",
      "Then there's the double body-swapping. Because one major swap isn't enough, here we have two sets of swappers \u2014 a quixotic quartet of lives disrupted during the lead-up to, yes, another wedding! The problem is that sometimes, it\u2019s actually hard to keep track of who\u2019s inhabiting whom, and therefore why they're doing what.",
      "Not to say that \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d directed with gusto by Nisha Ganatra, doesn't have moments of comic glee. I\u2019ll admit to laughing out loud \u2014 with everyone else older than 30 near me \u2014 when two teens were trying to locate an adult contact and one of them pulled up Facebook, explaining: \u201cIt\u2019s like a database of old people!\u201d Touch\u00e9, guys.",
      "These \u201cyoungsters\u201d are actually Lohan and Curtis, playing ninth-graders trapped in adult bodies. Before we get to that, though: We begin 22 years after we last saw Lohan\u2019s Anna, playing electric guitar at her mom's wedding. Now a single mom herself with a job managing a young pop star, she's trying to get her daughter up for school. Harper (the excellent Julia Butters) is \u2014 surprise! \u2014 an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager. And just like Anna two decades ago, she keeps people out of her bedroom. \u201cPrepare to be triggered!\u201d Anna yells before barging in. (The dialogue has been duly updated to the present time.)",
      "Driving to school drop-off, Anna is joined by her mom, Tess (Curtis), who has stylish gray hair now and is still a practicing therapist, podcaster and author whose latest topic is \u201cRebelling with Respect.\u201d Dropping Harper off, Anna calls out \u201cMake good choices!\u201d \u2014 just what mom Tess used to say, natch.",
      "At school, Harper butts heads with transfer student Lily (Sophia Hammons), a budding fashion designer who hails from Britain and is very snooty. Anna is called to see the principal. There, she meets Lily\u2019s dishy chef dad Eric (Manny Jacinto), and the two flirt so intensely, the principal herself makes them a dinner reservation.",
      "All it takes is one cute dating montage, and poof, Anna and Eric are engaged. But things are still bad between Harper and Lily, whose animosity triggers a weirdly violent, all-school food fight on bake sale day. But they all have a bachelorette party to attend. There, a wacky fortune-teller and barista and business-card maker \u2014 Vanessa Bayer, in a cameo that perhaps, no definitely goes on too long \u2014 reads their palms. And then the earth starts shaking.",
      "\u201cFreaky\u201d fans know what happens next. The four awaken the next morning, each inhabiting someone else. Anna is Harper. Tess is Lily. Harper is Anna. Lily is Tess. We\u2019ll be testing you on this later!",

She\u2019s flirting with Jake (Chad Michael Murray) \u2014 yes, the hunky guy from the original \u2014 and her flirting is so weird, Jake thinks she's having a stroke.",

Will the sisters-to-be reach an understanding? Will Lohan get to play the electric guitar? Will everyone grow to appreciate each other?",

      "It has become such common advice that few question it. But rather than inspirational, it can feel like a burden. How do I go about finding this and what if I never do?",
      "This is \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d \u2014 the gnawing sense that one\u2019s life should have an overarching purpose, but it\u2019s unclear how to discover it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,\u201d said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose.",
      "The definition of purpose can be elastic. Can you have only one purpose or can you have many? Does it have to involve service to others or can it be something that consistently gives only you great pleasure and meaning?",
      "Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. A sense of purpose can help \u201cclose that gap between who you are and what you ideally want to become,\u201d he said.",
      "People can lead content, meaningful lives without ever articulating a sense of purpose, he emphasized.",
      "There are many legitimate reasons for the advice given by parents, teachers, mentors and an array of online gurus that finding purpose is key to a good life. Research has shown that people who more strongly feel a sense of purpose tend to be physically and mentally healthier.",
      "But the word has become so weighty that finding a purpose has, for many, become a source of angst.",
      "The term \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d appears to have been coined in 2014 by a University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Larissa Rainey, and caught on. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir \u201cEat, Pray, Love,\u201d has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a \u201cpurposeful life.\u201d It is, she said in one interview, \u201cthe formula we\u2019ve all been fed.\u201d",

      "\u201cBut a lot of the places that we\u2019ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.\u201d",

      "But she ended up creating an online community for childless women called Gateway Women.com. In rural Ireland, where she lives, she is also helping build an in-person group that brings people without children together as they age.",

      "An inmate executed by Tennessee without deactivating his implanted defibrillator said he was in serious pain after the lethal injection started",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A man convicted of killing his girlfriend and her two young daughters in the 1980s said he was \u201churting so bad\u201d while he was given a lethal injection Tuesday in Tennessee, where authorities had refused to deactivate his implanted defibrillator despite claims it might cause unnecessary, painful shocks as the drugs were administered.",
      "Black's attorney said they will review data kept by the device as part of an autopsy.",
      "Black died at 10:43 a.m., prison officials said. It was about 10 minutes after the execution started and Black talked about being in pain.",
      "Asked for any last words, he replied, \u201cNo sir.\u201d",
      "Black looked around the room as the execution started, lifting his head off the gurney multiple times, and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily. All seven media witnesses to the execution agreed he appeared to be in discomfort. Throughout the execution, a spiritual adviser prayed and sang over Black, at one point touching his face.",
      "\u201cOh, it's hurting so bad,\" Black said, as he lay with his hands and chest restrained to the gurney, a sheet covering up past his lower half, and an IV line in his arm.",
      "\u201cI'm so sorry. Just listen to my voice,\u201d the adviser responded.",
      "Black was executed after a back-and-forth in court over whether officials would need to turn off his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD. Black, 69, was in a wheelchair, suffering from dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, congestive heart failure and other conditions, his attorneys have said.",
      "The nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center said it\u2019s unaware of any other cases with similar claims to Black\u2019s about ICDs or pacemakers. Black\u2019s attorneys said they haven\u2019t found a comparable case, either.",
      "Black was convicted in the 1988 shooting deaths of his girlfriend Angela Clay, 29, and her two daughters, Latoya Clay, 9, and Lakeisha Clay, 6. Prosecutors said he was in a jealous rage when he shot the three at their home. At the time, Black was on work-release while serving time for shooting Clay\u2019s estranged husband.",
      "Clay's sister said Black will now face a higher power.",
      "\u201cHis family is now going through the same thing we went through 37 years ago. I can't say I\u2019m sorry because we never got an apology,\" Linette Bell, Angela Clay's sister, said in a statement read by a victim's advocate after the execution.",
      "Black's lawyer said the execution was shameful.",
      "\u201cToday, the state of Tennessee killed a gentle, kind, fragile, intellectually disabled man in a violation of the laws of our country simply because they could,\" attorney Kelley Henry said.",
      "In mid-July, a trial court judge agreed with Black\u2019s attorneys that officials must have the defibrillator deactivated to avert the risk that it could cause unnecessary pain and prolong the execution. But Tennessee's Supreme Court overturned that decision Thursday, saying the other judge lacked authority to order the change.",
      "The state disputed that the lethal injection would cause Black\u2019s defibrillator to shock him and said he wouldn\u2019t feel them regardless.",

      "\u201cThe fact that he was able to raise his head several times and express pain tells you that the pentobarbital was not acting the way the state's experts claim it acts,\u201d Henry said.",
      "Prison officials did not comment on witnesses and Black\u2019s attorney saying he appeared conscious or his complaints of pain.",
      "It was Tennessee\u2019s second execution since May, after a pause for five years, first because of COVID-19 and then because of missteps by state corrections officials.",
      "Twenty-eight men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and nine other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025. The number of executions this year exceeds the 25 carried out last year and in 2018. It is the highest total since 2015, when 28 people were put to death.",
      "Black had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, which is a small, battery-powered electronic device that is surgically implanted in the chest. It served as a pacemaker and an emergency defibrillator. Black\u2019s attorneys have said a doctor can send it a deactivation command without surgery.",
      "The legal case also spurred a reminder that most medical professionals consider participation in executions a violation of health care ethics.",
      "In recent years, Black's legal team has unsuccessfully tried to get a new hearing about an intellectual disability they say he's exhibited since childhood. People with intellectual disabilities are constitutionally barred from execution.",
      "His attorneys have said that if they had delayed a prior attempt to seek his intellectual disability claim, he would have been spared under a 2021 state law. That is because the 2021 law denies a hearing to people on death row who have already filed a similar request and a court has ruled on it \u201con the merits.\"",
      "A judge denied Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk's attempt to get Black a new hearing. Funk focused on input from an expert for the state in 2004 who determined back then that Black didn\u2019t meet the criteria for what was then called \"mental retardation.\u201d But she concluded that Black met the new law\u2019s criteria for a diagnosis of intellectual disability.",

      "Research shows mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "WASHINGTON -- So-called mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and now scientists are using that Nobel Prize-winning technology to try to develop vaccines and treatments against a long list of diseases including cancer and cystic fibrosis.",
      "But this week, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, canceled $500 million in government-funded research projects to create new mRNA vaccines against respiratory illnesses that might trigger another health emergency.",
      "That dismays infectious disease experts who note that mRNA allows faster production of shots than older vaccine-production methods, buying precious time if another pandemic were to emerge.",
      "Using older technology to target a pandemic flu strain would take 18 months to \u201cmake enough vaccine to vaccinate only about one-fourth of the world,\" said Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota, an expert on pandemic preparation. But using mRNA technology \u201ccould change that dramatically, such that by the end of the first year, we could vaccinate the world.\u201d",
      "Traditionally, making vaccines required growing viruses or pieces of viruses called proteins \u2014 often in giant vats of cells or, like most flu shots, in chicken eggs \u2014 and then purifying them. Injecting a small dose as a vaccine trains the body how to recognize when a real infection hits so it's ready to fight back.",
      "But that technology takes a long time. Using mRNA is a faster process.",
      "The \u201cm\u201d stands for messenger, meaning mRNA carries instructions for our bodies to make proteins. Scientists figured out how to harness that natural process by making mRNA in a lab.",
      "They take a snippet of that genetic code that carries instructions for making the protein they want the vaccine to target. Injecting that snippet instructs the body to become its own mini-vaccine factory, making enough copies of the protein for the immune system to recognize and react.",
      "Years of research show protection from COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 both the types made with mRNA and a type made with traditional technology \u2014 does wane over time. The vaccinations provide the strongest protection against severe infection and death, even if people still become infected.",

      "Today's COVID-19 vaccines made with mRNA by Pfizer and Moderna can be updated more quickly each year than traditional types, an advantage that now has multiple companies developing other vaccines using the technology.",
      "Osterholm counts about 15 infectious disease vaccines that could benefit from mRNA technology, but that's not the only potential. Many disease therapies take aim at proteins, making mRNA a potential technique for developing new treatments. Researchers already are testing an mRNA-based therapeutic vaccine for pancreatic cancer.

      "The World Health Organization has closed in on its bold goal of eradicating polio several times, but the paralytic virus is entrenched in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan",
      "KARACHI, Pakistan -- For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. She hears their demands and fears. Some are practical \u2013 families need basics like food and water more than vaccines. Others are simply unfounded \u2013 the oral doses are meant to sterilize their kids.",
      "Amid rampant misinformation and immense pressure for the campaign to succeed, Ayaz said, some managers have instructed workers to falsely mark children as immunized. And the vaccines, which must be kept cold, aren\u2019t always stored correctly, she added.",
      "\u201cIn many places, our work is not done with honesty,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication \u2014 a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. They came close several times, including in 2021, when just five cases of the natural virus were reported in Pakistanand Afghanistan. But since then, cases rebounded, hitting 99 last year, and officials have missed at least six self-imposed eradication deadlines.",
      "Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio \u2014 which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. The worldwide campaign has focused most of its attention and funding there for the past decade.",
      "But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI \u2013 one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved.",
      "In Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2013 which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure \u2013 local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. But those issues, along with concerns by staffers and outside health officials, have long gone unaddressed, insiders say.",
      "Officials tout the successes \u2013 3 billion children vaccinated, an estimated 20 million people who would have been paralyzed spared \u2013 while acknowledging challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Remote villages are hard to reach, some cultural and religious authorities instruct against vaccination, and hundreds of polio workers and security staff have been killed because of their alignment with a Western-led initiative.",
      "Dr. Jamal Ahmed, WHO\u2019s polio director, defended progress in those two countries, citing workers\u2019 tailored response in resistant pockets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many children being protected today because of the work that was done over the past 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Its latest goal for eradication is 2029. The campaign says about 45 million children in Pakistan and 11 million in Afghanistan must be vaccinated this year. Children typically need four doses of two drops each to be considered fully immunized.",
      "Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who has served on advisory groups for WHO, the Gates Foundation and others, said campaign officials should listen to the criticism of its tactics.",
      "\u201cContinuing blindly with the same strategies that we have relied on since eradication began is unlikely to lead to a different result,\u201d he said.",
      "Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade \u2013 given to AP by current and former staffers \u2013 show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers.",
      "The documents flagged multiple cases of falsified vaccination records, health workers being replaced by untrained relatives and workers improperly administering vaccines.",
      "On numerous occasions, WHO officials noted, \u201cvaccinators did not know about vaccine management,\u201d citing failure to keep doses properly cold. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting \u201cmore used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.\u201d",
      "According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, \u201cresulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.\u201d",
      "Vaccination teams worked \u201cin a hurried manner,\u201d reports said, with \u201cno plan for monitoring or supervision.\u201d A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Village elders said no one visited for at least two years.",
      "Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it\u2019s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. Door-to-door efforts are stymied by cultural barriers, unfounded stories about vaccines, and the region\u2019s poverty and transience.",
      "\u201cMost of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,\u201d said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to talk to the press. \u201cMany people find it offensive that a stranger knocks on the door and talks to a woman.\u201d",
      "Some workers find families have moved. Occasionally, they say, the encounter abuse.",
      "\u201cWe have shared these problems with our senior officials,\u201d the worker told AP. \u201cThey know about it.\u201d",
      "In an email response to AP\u2019s questions about officials\u2019 knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted \u201coperational challenges\u201d in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has \u201crobust monitoring and evaluation processes.\u201d",
      "Worker Ayaz described \u201cfake finger marking\u201d \u2014 placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given.",
      "\u201cThere is so much pressure,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease \u2014 spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles \u2014 was among the world\u2019s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. People avoided crowded places during epidemics, and hospital wards filled with children encased in iron lungs after the virus immobilized their breathing muscles.",
      "Polio is mainly spread when people are exposed to water infected with the virus. In countries with poor sanitation, children often become infected when they come into contact with contaminated waste.",

      "The oral vaccine \u2013 proven to be safe and effective \u2014 has been given to more than 3 billion children. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine.",
      "In even rarer instances, the live virus can mutate into a form capable of starting new outbreaks among unimmunized people where vaccination rates are low.",
      "Worldwide, several hundred vaccine-derived cases have been reported annually since at least 2021, with at least 98 this year.",
      "Most public health experts agree the oral vaccine should be pulled as soon as possible. But they acknowledge there simply isn\u2019t enough injectable vaccine \u2014 which uses no live virus and doesn\u2019t come with the risks of the oral vaccine \u2014 to wipe out polio alone. The injectable vaccine also is more expensive and requires more training to administer.",
      "More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven\u2019t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign\u2019s problems.",
      "Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who sits on an independent board reviewing polio eradication, said it would be impossible to eliminate polio without the oral vaccine. But he\u2019s urged authorities to find ways to adapt, such as adopting new methods to identify polio cases more quickly. Since 2011, he and colleagues have issued regular reports about overall program failures.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no management,\u201d he said, citing a lack of accountability.",
      "Last year, former WHO scientist Dr. T. Jacob John twice emailed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus calling for a \u201cmajor course correction.\u201d John shared the emails with AP and said he\u2019s received no response.",
      "\u201cWHO is persisting with polio control and creating polio with one hand and attempting to control it by the other,\u201d John wrote.",
      "In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a \u201ccore pillar\u201d of eradication strategy and that \u201calmost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to step back and really care for the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.\u201d",
      "Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. In the four years before polio was wiped out there, health workers delivered about 1 billion doses of the oral vaccine to more than 170 million children.",
      "Today, nearly all of the world\u2019s polio cases -- mostly in Africa and the Middle East -- are mutated viruses from the oral vaccine, except for Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong \u2013 particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. They miscalculated, leading to outbreaks in more than 40 countries that paralyzed more than 3,000 children, according to an expert report commissioned by WHO. Last year, a mutated virus traced to that effort paralyzed a baby in Gaza.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a public inquiry where all the evidence comes out and WHO makes serious changes, it will be very hard to trust them,\u201d he said.",
      "With an annual budget of about $1 billion, the polio initiative is among the most expensive in all of public health. This year, the U.S. withdrew from WHO, and President Donald Trump has cut foreign aid. WHO officials have privately admitted that sustaining funding would be difficult without success.",
      "Some say the money would be better spent on other health needs.",
      "\u201cWe have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn\u2019t buy us any progress,\u201d said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. \u201cIf this was a private company, we would demand results.\u201d",
      "Villagers, too, have protested the cost, staging hundreds of boycotts of immunization campaigns since 2023. Instead of polio vaccines, they ask for medicine, food and electricity.",
      "In Karachi, locals told AP they didn\u2019t understand the government\u2019s fixation on polio and complained of other issues \u2014 dirty water, heroin addiction. Workers are accompanied by armed guards; Pakistani authorities say more than 200 workers and police assigned to protect them have been killed since the 1990s, mostly by militants.",
      "The campaign also is up against a wave of misinformation, including that the vaccine is made from pig urine or will make children reach puberty early. Some blame an anti-vaccine sentiment growing in the U.S. and other countries that have largely funded eradication efforts and say it\u2019s reaching even remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "In suburban southwest Pakistan, Saleem Khan, 58, said two grandchildren under 5 were vaccinated over his family\u2019s objections.",
      "\u201cIt results in disability,\u201d said Khan, without citing evidence for his belief. \u201cThey are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.\u201d",
      "Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. Now, people are angry about the focus on polio and lack of help for diseases like measles or tuberculosis, she said, spurring conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cPolio eradication has created a monster,\u201d Closser said. It doesn\u2019t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family.",
      "Workers see that continued mistrust every day.",
      "In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she'd prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it. They believe the false rumors that it will compromise their children\u2019s fertility.",

      "NEW YORK -- The toll of wildfires is usually counted in acres burnt, property destroyed and lives lost to smoke and flames. But three studies published Wednesday suggest the cost to human health from the Maui and Los Angeles wildfires was substantially higher.",
      "Two of the papers explore what happened after the Hawaii fire in August 2023 \u2014 one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires in a century. A third looks at the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year.",
      "The Maui fire was directly blamed for more than 100 deaths. But it also left 1 in 5 with lung damage and as many as half with symptoms of depression, the new research found. The month of the fire saw 13 suicide and overdose deaths, translating to nearly double the normal suicide and overdose death rates.",
      "The study of the Los Angeles fires concluded that in addition to at least 30 deaths attributed to the fire, more than 400 other deaths could be blamed on the event, due to interruptions in health care and other factors.",
      "The studies, published in two American Medical Association journals, add \"a really important piece to the understanding of the true health risks from these extreme climatic events,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a University of Wisconsin environmental public health researcher who was not involved in the papers.",
      "The results conform with existing understanding of the effects of extreme weather events, some experts said.",
      "How to track the indirect impacts of disastrous events has been a continuing subject of academic research and even legislative proposals. There have been estimates of deaths caused by extreme heat, as well as research into the large-scale toll of wildfires driven by climate change.",
      "\u201cBut this hones in, especially on (specific) fires,\u201d Patz said.",
      "One of the studies, co-led by Ruben Juarez of the University of Hawaii, looked at more than 1,100 adults six to 14 months after the Maui fire. It found lower lung function in people in areas close to the fire compared with those in lower-exposure areas. Overall, about 22% had below-normal lung function.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a stark reminder that wildfires can leave an invisible but lasting scar on respiratory health, long after the flames are gone,\u201d Juarez said, in an email, noting that this Friday marks the two-year anniversary of the fire.",
      "Patz called the finding \u201can important new contribution.\u201d",
      "Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington echoed that, noting that there is a growing understanding that wildfire smoke can be more toxic than standard air pollution.",

      "She said the study suggests \u201cthis toxicity is affecting people's long-term lung function.\u201d",
      "Of course, the researchers don't know exactly how much smoke each person was exposed to, and other studies would need to be done to explore cause-and-effect, she added.",
      "The study also found 40% saying their health had declined since the fires, with close to half talking about increased fatigue and weakness, eye irritation and lung-related symptoms.",
      "Jonathan Purtle of New York University was the lead author of another study, which calculated rates of suicide and overdose deaths in Maui and Hawaii's four other counties. That research team found a 97% increase in suicides and overdose death rates on Maui during the month of the wildfires. The total number of suicide and overdose deaths was 13 that month \u2014 most of them suicides. That's a significant increase, Ebi said.",
      "They also found a 46% increase in such deaths in all five counties, which may have been influenced by displaced Maui residents migrating to other islands, the authors said.",
      "The increases did not last: Rates fells in the following months, the researchers found.",
      "The third study was led by researchers in Finland. They used mathematical modeling to estimate that there were 440 more deaths in Los Angeles County from Jan. 5 to Feb. 1 than what would normally have been expected, and said those are related to the fires.",

      "Defibrillators are surgically placed in the upper chest, where they monitor irregular heartbeats and use electrical shocks to jolt the heart back to normal.",
      "As of July 24, Boston Scientific has reported 386 serious injuries and 16 deaths associated with this issue, the agency said.",
      "Ten of the deaths were judged to be due to the device failing to function properly, the company said in an email. Four were linked to attempts to surgically remove the devices from patients and two others were deemed unrelated to the implants.",
      "Boston Scientific's wires were distributed between 2002 and 2021 and are no longer available, the company noted in its letter to doctors. Some patients will need to have the devices replaced, though physicians should weigh the risks of the removal procedure.",
      "In a separate notice, the FDA said Boston Scientific recently updated instructions for implanting its Watchman device, which closes a portion of the heart's left atrium to reduce the risk of stroke.",
      "In a letter to physicians, the company noted that there is an increased risk of blockages in the bloodstream depending on the level of anesthesia for patients undergoing the initial implantation procedure.

      "Policymakers decided to cut rates even though consumer prices rose 3.6% in the 12 months through June, significantly above the bank\u2019s 2% target.

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Great Barrier Reef has experienced its greatest annual loss of live coral across most of its expanse in four decades of record-keeping, Australian authorities say.",
      "But due to increasing coral cover since 2017, the coral deaths \u2014 caused mainly by bleaching last year associated with climate change \u2014 have left the area of living coral across the iconic reef system close to its long-term average, the Australian Institute of Marine Science said in its annual survey on Wednesday.",
      "The change underscores a new level of volatility on the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the report said.",
      "Mike Emslie, who heads the tropical marine research agency\u2019s long-term monitoring program, said the live coral cover measured in 2024 was the largest recorded in 39 years of surveys.",
      "The losses from such a high base of coral cover had partially cushioned the serious climate impacts on the world\u2019s largest reef ecosystem, which covers 344,000 square kilometers (133,000 square miles) off the northeast Australian coast, he said.",
      "\u201cThese are substantial impacts and evidence that the increasing frequency of coral bleaching is really starting to have detrimental effects on the Great Barrier Reef,\u201d Emslie said on Thursday.",
      "\u201cWhile there\u2019s still a lot of coral cover out there, these are record declines that we have seen in any one year of monitoring,\u201d he added.",
      "Emslie\u2019s agency divides the Great Barrier Reef, which extends 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) along the Queensland state coast, into three similarly-sized regions: northern, central and southern.",
      "Living coral cover shrunk by almost a third in the south in a year, a quarter in the north and by 14% in the central region, the report said.",
      "Because of record global heat in 2023 and 2024, the world is still going through its biggest \u2014 and fourth ever recorded \u2014 mass coral bleaching event on record, with heat stress hurting nearly 84% of the world\u2019s coral reef area, including the Great Barrier Reef, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s coral reef watch. So far at least 83 countries have been impacted.",
      "This bleaching event started in January 2023 and was declared a global crisis in April 2024. It easily eclipsed the previous biggest global coral bleaching event, from 2014 to 2017, when 68.2% had bleaching from heat stress.",

Australia in March this year started aerial surveys of 281 reefs across the Torres Strait and the entire northern Great Barrier Reef and found widespread coral bleaching. Of the 281 reefs, 78 were more than 30% bleached.",
      "Coral has a hard time thriving and at times even surviving in prolonged hot water. They can survive short bursts, but once certain thresholds of weeks and high temperatures are passed, the coral is bleached, which means it turns white because it expels the algae that live in the tissue and give them their colors. Bleached corals are not dead, but they are weaker and more vulnerable to disease.",
      "Coral reefs often bounce back from these mass global bleaching events, but often they are not as strong as they were before.",
      "Coral reefs are considered a \u201cunique and threatened system\u201d due to climate change and are especially vulnerable to global warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proclaimed in 2018.

That report said \u201ctropical corals may be even more vulnerable to climate change than indicated in assessments made in 2014.\u201d",

      "The ban threatens people with prison time for selling or owning works by authors such as Booker Prize-winning novelist and activist Arundhati Roy, constitutional expert A.G. Noorani, and noted academicians and historians like Sumantra Bose, Christopher Snedden and Victoria Schofield.",
      "The order was issued on Tuesday by the region\u2019s Home Department, which is under the direct control of Lt. Gov. Manoj Sinha, New Delhi\u2019s top administrator in Kashmir.",
      "Sinha wields substantial power in the region as the national government's representative, while elected officials run a largely powerless government that came to power last year after the first local election since India stripped the disputed region of its special status in 2019.",
      "The order declared the 25 books \u201cforfeit\u201d under India\u2019s new criminal code of 2023, effectively banning the works from circulation, possession and access within the Himalayan region. Various elements of the code threaten prison terms of three years, seven years or even life for offenses related to forfeit media, although no one has yet been jailed under them.",
      "\u201cThe identified 25 books have been found to excite secessionism and endangering sovereignty and integrity of India,\u201d the Home Department said in its notice. It said such books played \u201ca critical role in misguiding the youth, glorifying terrorism and inciting violence against Indian State.\u201d",
      "The action was taken following \u201cinvestigations and credible intelligence\u201d about \u201csystemic dissemination of false narratives and secessionist literature\u201d that was \u201coften disguised as historical or political commentary,\u201d it said.",

      "India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.",
      "Since 2019, authorities have increasingly criminalized dissent and shown no tolerance for any narrative that questions India\u2019s sovereignty over Kashmir.",

      "N\u00e9lida P\u00e9rez feeds street cats in Old Havana, but Cuba's worsening economic crisis is making it increasingly difficult",
      "HAVANA -- Every afternoon, 81-year-old N\u00e9lida P\u00e9rez begins her familiar walk down the cobblestone streets of Old Havana, a procession of hungry cats trailing close behind her.",
      "For years, P\u00e9rez has taken it upon herself to feed some of the street cats that roam this part of town, which is also one of the most popular tourist spots in the Cuban capital. She once relied on her own food or restaurant donations, but as the island\u2019s economic situation worsened and tourism declined, it has become increasingly difficult to provide for them.",
      "\u201cI have never in my life asked anyone for a plate of food to feed my cats,\" P\u00e9rez told The Associated Press. \"Now I see myself in difficulties because there is no tourism and there is an economic crisis.\u201d",
      "Since 2020, Cuba has faced a worsening economic crisis, driven by COVID-19 shutdowns, stricter U.S. sanctions, and an internal monetary reform that triggered inflation.",
      "Although the government provides vaccines, sterilization and some free clinics, it does not have the means to provide shelter and food for street cats and dogs. While official data is unavailable, activists say that many pet lovers have turned their homes \u2014 even small apartments \u2014 into shelters, but they are struggling to keep up with the demand and provide adequate care.",
      "\u201cThe streets will kill them,\u201d said B\u00e1rbara Iglesias, a 51-year-old pharmacist who adopted five dogs and has rescued and found homes for a dozen others. Iglesias explained that the hardest part is getting food. A 20-kilo (44-pound) bag of dog food, which lasts one dog for about 45 days, costs around $80 \u2014 a sum that is out of reach for most. This forces people to feed animals with pig organ meat (offal), chicken parts or mince meat \u2014 which are also not easy to obtain.",
      "On top of that, annual vaccines cost about $20 and a vet visit is another $10, all while the average monthly salary on the island is only about $12.",
      "Experts say that the abandonment of animals in Cuba is a result of several factors, including rising food and medicine prices, the migration of hundreds of thousands of Cubans in the last five years, and a high mortality rate among older adults.",
      "\u201cPeople are more focused on their problems, which are numerous: Cubans don\u2019t have water, they don\u2019t have electricity, and getting food is becoming increasingly difficult,\u201d said Annelie Gonz\u00e1lez, one of the leaders of the Aldameros Project, a cat colony located in a park in Havana\u2019s historic center.",

      "She and a small group of volunteers began feeding 15 cats in Aldameros Park at the beginning of the pandemic. Today, they care for more than 150. Over the years, through their own efforts and some donations, they were able to install water pumps, pens for special cases, and cages for the kittens.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez points to a number that she said reveals the shocking scale of the problem: at the start of the decade, roughly three abandoned cats appeared in the park each week. This year, that figure has soared to 15 per day.",

    "story": [
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s fast-tracking of the law was a step too far, the public concluded.",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy quickly reversed course last month on a law that would have curbed the independence of the country\u2019s anti-corruption watchdogs after widespread protests that threatened the stability of his leadership for the first time since Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "It's unlikely that the damage to the president\u2019s image can be changed as easily.",
      "Zelenskyy's reversal followed years of public discontent that simmered around his inner circle, some of whom have been accused of corruption. But Ukrainians have been largely deferential toward their president in wartime, trusting him to lead the fight against the Kremlin and even acquiescing in the suspension of some civil liberties.",
      "The protests showed the limits of that goodwill after the public concluded that Zelenskyy\u2019s fast-tracking of the law was a step too far.",
      "\u201cPeople will support Zelenskyy in whatever he does as it relates to the war. But the previous level of trust \u201cthat he will carry out everything correctly, without outside interests, has been damaged,\" said Tetiana Shevchuk, a board member of the Ukrainian nonprofit Anti-Corruption Action Center, which fights graft. Zelenskyy \"will need to work hard to get it back.\u201d",
      "A Gallup poll released Thursday found that about two-thirds of Ukrainians approve of the way Zelenskyy is handling his job as president, down from 84% in 2022. Another poll released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found a similar pattern, with trust in Zelenskyy down from just before the war started and a sharp decrease since after the signing of the law.",
      "Both polls were conducted in July and excluded adults living in regions of the country that were not controlled by Ukraine or were under entrenched Russian control.",
      "The initial decision to sign the proposal hurt Zelenskyy's standing among Ukrainians, loyal lawmakers and Western allies, including one foreign minister who told The Associated Press that his willingness to backtrack on the law would help restore \u201clost trust.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy sparked the outcry when he signed measures to reduce the powers of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, or NABU, and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office, or SAPO.",
      "Zelenskyy said the initial bill was meant to root out Russian influence in those agencies, but he did not provide evidence to support the claim. The bill became a law so quickly that lawmakers said they barely had time to read it. For the Ukrainian people, patience wore thin.",
      "From the outset of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, the public tolerated restrictions such as martial law and postponed elections. But critics also argued that the consolidation of the president\u2019s authority undermined the country\u2019s democratic institutions, along with the checks and balances necessary for transparency. Members of Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle and the corruption allegations fueled public resentment.",
      "The resulting anti-corruption protests in July in Kyiv and other cities were among the largest in years, drawing thousands of demonstrators and reflecting widespread public demand for transparency and accountability even during wartime.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not one law that brought people to the streets, but a series of events and mostly an accumulation of feelings and wanting to show the government there are certain red lines,\u201d Shevchuk said.",
      "Ukrainian leaders have been sensitive to public opinion ever since the Euromaidan protests of 2013 and 2014, which ignited extraordinary political changes, including the ousting of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych. Those protests marked a decisive moment in Ukraine\u2019s history and galvanized public intolerance toward corruption and abuse of power.",
      "Until recently, Zelenskyy\u2019s decisions and public statements aligned mostly with public opinion. He watches polls closely. For instance, he did not say that Ukraine would be unable to win back occupied territory militarily until polls showed that Ukrainians were willing to end the war for territorial concessions.",
      "Many of the suspicions about Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle focused on the head of his presidential office, Andriy Yermak, who is seen as having too much power, according to activists and Ukrainian and Western officials. In recent weeks, two other individuals close to Zelenskyy sparked public ire ahead of the protests.",
      "The first was former Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Chernyshov, a close ally of Zelenskyy\u2019s, who in June was formally named a suspect in a high-profile land-grab case. Later, the NABU announced that he was the sixth suspect in a large corruption scheme led by a Kyiv property developer.",

      "\u201cUkrainians are united around the president in his war efforts, in his efforts to gain support from allies right now and the necessary military aid,\" Shevchuk said. \"But at the same time, people know what is happening with the close allies of the president, the allegations of corruption, so this does not go unnoticed.\u201d",
      "The protests \"were a reminder to the president from the people basically saying, \u2018We see everything, remember everything. And we don\u2019t want the president to use his power to protect corruption,\u2019\u201d she added.",
      "Lawmakers who speedily passed the first law limiting the NABU and the SAPO said the backlash undercut the blind trust in bills backed by Zelenskyy. Bills supported by him were once passed with little objection, with few exceptions.",
      "\u201cI voted not because I agreed with the law, but because it was the president\u2019s decision,\u201d said lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of Zelenskyy\u2019s party. \u201cI had no time to read it, but I understood what was at risk, and I voted like other people because we trusted the president. It was his decision, and we are team players.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy himself conceded that communication about the law had been lacking.",
      "\u201cProbably there should have been a dialogue. Communication is always necessary,\u201d he told reporters on July 24.",
      "The firm faith in Zelenskyy led one lawmaker to joke that if the president nominated a spoon for prime minister, Parliament would likely vote in favor. But that sentiment has changed, Merezhko said, with parliament now becoming more independent.",
      "\u201cNow members of parliament will be more careful,\u201d he said. \u201cIf before we had a presumption of trust with respect to the president or cabinet of the bills, we now have a presumption of mistrust. If similar bills are introduced,\" members of parliament \"will remember what happened. They don\u2019t want to be framed or blamed for what happened.\u201d",
      "But lawmakers commended Zelenskyy for acting swiftly to reverse his decision and quiet the anger on the street. Last week, parliament passed another bill restoring the independence of the NABU and the SAPO.",
      "\u201cPeople asked for changes. We responded,\u201d Zelenskyy told reporters.",
      "The proposed law also drew concern among Ukraine\u2019s European allies, who suggested it could imperil support for Kyiv and affect Ukraine's bid to join the EU. Ukraine's closest allies welcomed the swift turnaround.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer raised the issue in a July 24 call with Zelenskyy. A readout of the call from Starmer\u2019s office said the leaders \"agreed on the importance of the role of independent anti-corruption institutions at the heart of Ukraine\u2019s democracy.\u201d",
      "In Germany, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul expressed dismay when Zelenskyy approved the measures to reduce the powers of the NABU and the SAPO. When Zelenskyy reversed course, Wadephul wrote on X that the Ukrainian parliament\u2019s vote \"was a positive and necessary step toward regaining lost trust.\u201d",

The detention warrant for Yoon expires Thursday.",
      "The investigation targeting Yoon\u2019s wife, Kim Keon Hee, is one of three separate special prosecutor probes launched under the government of new liberal President Lee Jae Myung related to Yoon, who was removed from office in April and rearrested last month over his brief imposition of martial law in December.",

      "Kim is also suspected of receiving a necklace and other gifts through a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, and of possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme.",

Yoon\u2019s lawyers criticized the repeated attempts to force him to appear for questioning, stating that he has already made clear his intention to exercise his right to remain silent and accusing investigators of infringing upon his rights in order to publicly shame him.",

Some political opponents have questioned whether the conservative leader\u2019s actions were at least partly motivated by growing allegations against his wife, which hurt his approval ratings and gave political ammunition to his rivals.",

      "After winning the early presidential election in June, new liberal President Lee Jae Myung approved legislation to launch sweeping special investigations into Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle, the allegations against his wife, and the 2023 drowning death of a marine during a flood rescue operation, an incident the liberals claim Yoon\u2019s government tried to cover up.",

Naturally, bugs are on sale as well, with the more esoteric ones selling for 20,000 yen ($133).",

      "About 18,000 South Korean troops will take part in this year\u2019s Ulchi Freedom Shield exercise, South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson, Col. Lee Sung Joon, said during a joint briefing with U.S. Forces Korea, which did not disclose the number of participating U.S. troops.",
      "Both Lee and U.S. Forces Korea public affairs director Col. Ryan Donald downplayed speculation that South Korea\u2019s new liberal government, led by President Lee Jae Myung, sought to downsize the exercise to create momentum for dialogue with Pyongyang, saying its scale is similar to previous years. However, Col. Lee said about half of the exercise\u2019s originally planned 40 field training programs were postponed to September due to heat concerns.",
      "The threat from North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear and missile programs will be a key focus of the exercise, which will include training to deter North Korean nuclear use and respond to its missile attacks, Lee said.",
      "The exercise will also incorporate lessons from recent conflicts, including Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the clash between Israel and Iran, and address threats from drones, GPS jamming and cyberattacks, Lee and Donald said.",
      "\u201cWe look across the globe at the challenges we may face on the battlefield and incorporate that so we can challenge the participants in the exercise,\u201d Donald said. \u201cWe are focused on ensuring the alliance is sustainable and credibly deters aggression from the DPRK and addresses the broader regional security challenges,\u201d he said, using the initials of North Korea\u2019s formal name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",
      "The announcement of the exercise came a week after the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un rebuffed overtures by Lee Jae Myung\u2019s government, saying that Seoul\u2019s \u201cblind trust\u201d in its alliance with Washington and hostility toward Pyongyang make it no different from its hard-line conservative predecessor.",

      "Global financial markets have taken President Donald Trump's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian and European shares and U.S. futures mostly higher",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy.",
      "Just after midnight, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union became subject to tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the EU, Japan and South Korea are taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are taxed at 20%. Trump also expects the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. He added that the U.S. was \u201ctaking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,\u201d but he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \u201cwe don\u2019t even know what the final number is\u201d regarding tariff rates.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the Republican administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.",
      "But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump\u2019s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.",
      "\u201cA less productive economy requires fewer workers,\u201d Silvia said in an analysis note. \u201cBut there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\u201d",
      "Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly.",
      "\u201cWe all want it to be made for television where it\u2019s this explosion \u2014 it\u2019s not like that,\u201d said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\u201d",
      "Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year.",
      "The economic pain isn't confined to the U.S. Germany, which sends 10% of its exports to the U.S. market, saw industrial production sag 1.9% in June as Trump's earlier rounds of tariff hikes took hold. \u201cThe new tariffs will clearly weigh on economic growth,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro for ING bank.",
      "The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 only said the higher tax rates would start in seven days.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is vowing to \u201cfix\u201d the federal program for compensating Americans injured by vaccines, opening the door to sweeping changes for a system long targeted by anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Health experts and lawyers say updates are needed to help clear a backlog of cases in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, created by Congress in 1986 as a no-fault payment system for presumed vaccine injuries.",
      "But they also worry Kennedy\u2019s changes will reflect his history as a leader in the anti-vaccine movement, which has alternately called for abolishing the program or expanding it to cover unproven injuries and illnesses that aren't connected to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy and other critics believe the program is \u201ctoo miserly in what it considers to be a vaccine injury,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a public health expert at Yale University. \u201cThat\u2019s created great concern that he could expand what\u2019s included.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine groups have long suggested a link between vaccines and autism, despite scientific consensus that childhood vaccines don\u2019t cause the condition. Adding autism to the list of injuries covered by the plan \u201cwould dramatically increase the number of compensable cases, potentially bankrupting it,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Signed into law under President Ronald Reagan, the compensation program is designed to provide quick, efficient compensation to Americans who report known injuries associated with vaccines, such as rare allergic reactions. At the time of its creation, a number of vaccine-makers were exiting the business due to risks of class action lawsuits.",
      "In a recent social media post, Kennedy called the program \u201cbroken\u201d and accused federal lawyers and adjudicators who run it of \u201cinefficiency, favoritism and outright corruption.\u201d",
      "Kennedy didn\u2019t specify the changes he's seeking. But some of the people he\u2019s enlisted to help have a history of bringing vaccine injury cases.",
      "In June, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded a $150,000 contract to an Arizona law firm for \u201cexpertise\u201d in the program. The firm\u2019s Andrew Downing, an attorney specializing in vaccine injury cases, was listed in the HHS staff directory for a time.",
      "\u201cWe just brought a guy in this week who is going to be revolutionizing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,\u201d Kennedy told Tucker Carlson shortly after the award.",
      "Revamping the program would be the latest in a string of decisions that have upended U.S. vaccine policy, including this week's cancellation of research funding for vaccines using mRNA technology.",
      "Downing has had a leading role in lawsuits against Merck alleging injuries from its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, including a rare movement disorder.",
      "In a podcast last year for people with the condition, Downing lamented that the injury compensation program \u201chas taken a hard line\u201d against such cases, leading lawyers to file injury lawsuits in civil court. Approximately 70% of the Gardasil cases against Merck started as claims filed by Downing in the federal injury program, according to court records.",
      "A judge dismissed more than 120 of those cases, citing \u201ca paucity of evidence\" that Gardasil caused patients' problems.",
      "A spokesman for Kennedy declined to comment on Downing\u2019s hiring.",
      "Kennedy himself has been involved in the Gardasil litigation, as both an attorney and consultant.",
      "Before joining the government, Kennedy received payments for referring potential Gardasil clients to Wisner Baum, one of the law firms suing Merck. Following questions about the agreement during his confirmation hearings, Kennedy agreed to give up his stake in the deal and transfer any future fees to \u201ca nondependent, adult son,\" according to his financial disclosures.",
      "One of Kennedy's sons is an attorney at Wisner Baum.",

      "The cap on compensation remains $250,000 for injury or death, the same as in 1986. Similarly, the program still has eight adjudicators, known as special masters, to review all cases before the government. On average, the process takes two to three years.",
      "The fund has paid out $5.4 billion, compensating about 40% of all people who filed claims.",
      "The U.S. has an \u201cethical obligation\u201d to promptly pay those harmed by government-recommended vaccines, says Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law.",
      "\u201cPlus, I think it increases trust in the vaccination program if you have quick, generous compensation,\u201d Reiss said.",
      "As health secretary, Kennedy has broad powers to reshape the program.",
      "One approach could be adding new diseases and illnesses to the government table of payable injuries.",
      "In the early 2000s, the program ruled against more than 5,000 claims from families who said vaccines led to their children\u2019s autism, citing hundreds of scientific studies discrediting the link.",
      "Critics of Kennedy say he could claim that he has new evidence of harm \u2014 perhaps from a large autism study he's commissioned \u2014 and add the condition to the program.",
      "In response, the federal government might have to increase taxes on vaccines to replenish the compensation fund, which would make the shots more expensive and less accessible.",
      "\u201cThen you will start to watch the vaccine program infrastructure in this country disintegrate until someone steps in,\u201d Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who has clashed with Kennedy for years.",
      "A recent Senate hearing titled \u201cVoice of the Vaccine Injured\u201d appeared to make the case for expanding the program. Witnesses included two representatives from Children\u2019s Health Defense, the nonprofit group that Kennedy previously chaired and has repeatedly sued the government over vaccines.",
      "The group\u2019s chief science officer, Brian Hooker, told lawmakers he tried unsuccessfully for 16 years trying to get compensation for his son\u2019s autism, which he attributes to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.",
      "Another approach would involve removing certain vaccines from the program, making it easier to bring lawsuits against vaccine-makers. Under current law, people claiming injuries from vaccines covered by the program must first pursue a compensation claim before they can sue.",
      "In cases where the science doesn\u2019t support a connection to vaccines, lawyers might be more successful before a jury.",
      "\u201cJury trials take advantage of the fact that most jurors don\u2019t know anything about science or medicine,\u201d Offit said. \u201cThey are not going to be as easily moved by the data.\u201d",
      "Still, attorneys who bring cases before the compensation program say the process has become more burdensome and adversarial over the years.",
      "Even small changes could improve things. For instance, the statute of limitations for claims could be extended beyond the current three years, which lawyers say cuts off many potential clients.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping there will be changes put in place that make the program easier for petitioners to navigate\u201d said Leah Durant, a vaccine injury attorney.",

      "President Donald Trump's new tariff rates on U.S. imports from dozens of countries have taken effect, the latest chapter in his effort to reshape global trade",
      "BANGKOK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff rates on U.S. imports from dozens of countries took effect Thursday, the latest chapter in the saga of Trump\u2019s reshaping of global trade. But many questions remain.",
      "Trump has threatened tariffs of up to 200% on imports of pharmaceuticals and has ordered a 100% import tax on computer chips. Most U.S. imports of copper, steel and aluminum are subject to a 50% tariff.",
      "There\u2019s still no agreement on what tariffs might apply to products shipped from China. India has no deal yet and faces a potential 50% tariff as Trump pressures it to stop buying oil from Russia.",
      "Recent data shows uncertainty is clouding the outlook for exporters around the world as a rush to beat the tariffs during a pause for negotiation tapers off. Companies are reporting billions of dollars in higher costs or losses due to the higher import duties.",
      "Global financial markets took Thursday's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian shares and U.S. futures mostly higher.",
      "Here's where things stand in what has proven to be a fast-changing policy landscape.",
      "The tariffs announced on Aug. 1 apply to 66 countries, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands. They are a revised version of what Trump called \" reciprocal tariffs,\" announced on April 2: import taxes of up to 50% on goods from countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, along with 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 taxes on almost everyone else. That move triggered sell-offs in financial markets and Trump backtracked to allow time for trade talks.",
      "The president has bypassed Congress, which has authority over taxes, by invoking a 1977 law to declare the trade deficit a national emergency. That's being challenged in court, but the revised tariffs still took effect.",
      "To keep their access to the huge American market, major trading partners have struck deals with Trump. The United Kingdom agreed to 10% tariffs and the European Union, South Korea and Japan accepted U.S. tariffs of 15%. Those are much higher than the low single-digit rates they paid last year, but down from the 30% Trump had ordered for the EU and the 25% he ordered for Japan.",
      "Countries in Africa and Asia are mostly facing lower rates than the ones Trump decreed in April. Thailand, Pakistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines cut deals with Trump, settling for rates of around 20%.",
      "Indonesia views its 19% tariff deal as a leg up against exporters in other countries that will have to pay slightly more, said Fithra Faisal Hastiadi, a spokesperson in the Indonesian president's office.",
      "\u201cWe were competing against Vietnam, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and China ... and they are all subject to higher reciprocal tariffs,\u201d Hastiadi said. \u201cWe believe we will stay competitive.\u201d",
      "Trump has yet to announce whether he will extend an Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China that would forestall earlier threats of tariffs of up to 245%.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the president is deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in fentanyl.",

      "India also has no broad trade agreement with Trump. On Wednesday, Trump he signed an executive order placing an extra 25% tariff for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing combined U.S. tariffs to 50%. India has stood firm, saying it began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict.",

      "It\u2019s been nearly 100 years since the nation had an overall import tax rate as high as the one set Thursday. But the individual impact on business costs and consumer prices could vary as much as the tariffs applied to goods of nearly 70 U.S. trading partners, from complicated economies like the European Union to the small African nation of Lesotho.",

      "Businesses in the U.S. and abroad have been dealing in various ways since February with Trump's fluctuating tariffs on specific products and countries. Many automakers appeared to have absorbed the costs for now. But recent government data indicated that retail prices for groceries, furniture and appliances started creeping up in June.",
      "Because tariffs are a tax on imports, economists have expected U.S. consumers to foot at least part of the bill eventually.",
      "The country-specific round enforced Thursday, together with the president's earlier tariffs on specific sectors such as automobiles and steel, will increase prices 1.8% in the short term, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated. That\u2019s the equivalent of a $2,400 loss of income per U.S. household, according to the non-partisan policy research center",
      "The projections were based on an analysis of duties implemented this year through Wednesday, as well as a doubling of the levy on items made in India that Trump said would be implemented near the end of August.",
      "\"Retailers have been able to hold the line on pricing so far, but the new increased tariffs will significantly raise costs for U.S. retailers, manufacturers and consumers,\u201d Jonathan Gold, Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation trade group, said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the tariffs and where U.S. consumers are most likely to notice effects:",
      "Trump unveiled sweeping import taxes on goods coming into the U.S. from 66 countries, the European Union, Taiwan and the Falkland Islands in April. He said the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs were meant to boost domestic manufacturing and restore fairness to global trade.",
      "The president paused the country-specific tariffs a week later but applied a 10% tax to most imports. In early July, he began notifying countries that their exports would be subject to higher tariffs on Aug. 1 unless they reached trade deals. A week ago, he pushed the start date to Thursday.",
      "In the meantime, Trump announced a 35% tariff on imports from Canada, but delayed action on Mexico while negotiations continued. However, a free trade agreement reached with Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term shields most of those countries' products from punishing duties.",
      "The president also ordered a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil. This week, he signed an executive order to take India's tariff rate from 25% to 50% for its purchases of Russian oil. The timing gives India and Russia a chance to negotiate with the Trump administration.",
      "Other duties not specific to countries remain in place, such as a 50% tariff on imported aluminum and steel announced in June. Trump also threatened 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren\u2019t made in the U.S. The administration has said tariffs are still coming on imported pharmaceutical drugs.",
      "The U.S. Commerce Department reported on July 31 that prices rose 2.6% in June, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Earlier in July, the government reported that its primary inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, also ticked higher in June as the cost of furniture, toys and other frequently imported items increased.",

But with the EU's tariff rate raised to 15% on Thursday, customers may see European wines costing 30% more in September, U.S. Wine Trade Alliance President Ben Aneff said.",
      "Some automakers already raised prices to counteract tariffs. Luxury sports car maker Ferrari said last week it was waiting for more details of Trump's trade deal with the EU before scaling back a 10% surcharge it put on most vehicles in the U.S.",
      "For the most part, automakers waited for details instead of passing on tariff costs to consumers. But that could change.",
      "General Motors said on July 22 that the impact of the tariffs could get more pronounced in the third quarter of the year. GM has estimated the tariffs will cost it $4 billion to $5 billion this year.",
      "Toyota reported Thursday a 37% drop in profits in the April-June quarter, cutting its full-year earnings forecasts largely because of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Even with so many new tariffs kicking in, the tariff situation remains fluid. Trump\u2019s use of an emergency powers law to implement tariffs is being challenged in the courts. The case is expected to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Moreover, the tariffs on goods from China haven't been finalized. Consumers may start seeing more effects when the administration ends a tax exemption for small parcels sent from other countries.",
      "Trump last week signed an order to suspend the \u201cde minimis\" exemption that has allowed shipments valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free. International e-commerce companies have widely used the rule to avoid paying customs charges.",
      "Trump withdrew the exemption in early April for goods shipped from China and Hong Kong tariff-free. It is now set to be eliminated for low-value packages from every country on Aug. 29.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency has terminated $7 billion in funding for solar programs approved under the Biden administration, including projects for nearly 1 million households in low-income communities",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday terminated a $7 billion grant program that was intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. households.",
      "It's the latest Trump administration move hindering the nation\u2019s shift to cleaner energy.",
      "The funding, part of Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens.",
      "Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending bill signed last month by Republican President Donald Trump. The law eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund that was approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The fund set aside $20 billion in \u201cgreen bank\u201d money for community development projects to boost renewable energy, and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,\u2033 Zeldin said. \u201cToday, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!\u201d",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, who introduced the Solar for All program to slash electric bills for working families, called Zeldin\u2019s action illegal.",
      "\u201cSolar for All means lower utility bills, many thousands of good-paying jobs and real action to address the existential threat of climate change,\u2033 Sanders said in a statement. \u201dAt a time when working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing energy costs and the planet is literally burning, sabotaging this program isn\u2019t just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely insane. We will fight back to preserve this enormously important program.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has already targeted the \u201cgreen bank\u201d funds, first freezing the grants, then terminating the agreements altogether. Zeldin called them \u201ca clear cut case of waste and abuse\u201d and a \u201cgold bar\u201d scheme earlier this year.",
      "The EPA has argued that the tax and policy bill law repealed the green bank and allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree. They say the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and isn\u2019t affected by the law.",
      "Grant recipients have filed lawsuits challenging the administration\u2019s actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts.",

      "Millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts could have the option of putting their money in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments",
      "NEW YORK -- Millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts could have the option of putting their money in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency investments, according to an executive order signed Thursday by President Donald Trump that could give those financial players long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions.",
      "There is no immediate change in how people invest part of their work earnings. Federal agencies would need to rewrite rules and regulations to allow the expanded choices, and that would take months or more to complete. But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate.",
      "The Republican president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA. Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street. Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Trump's move rewards both the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for decades has wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans, and the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign as they aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected.",
      "Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with \u201cextreme care\u201d because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic.",
      "For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump\u2019s campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump\u2019s military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security.",
      "Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago.",

Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, have agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans.",
      "Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for the major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are not likely to revise their retirement plan options quickly as well, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments are mainstream in an individual\u2019s retirement plan.",

      "Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger on Thursday \u2014 kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious, over year-long endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line",
      "NEW YORK -- Skydance and Paramount officially closed their $8 billion merger on Thursday \u2014 kicking off the reign of a new entertainment giant after a contentious, over year-long endeavor to get the transaction over the finish line.",
      "The new company \u2014 which will trade under the \u201cPSKY\u201d ticker on Wall Street \u2014 brings Paramount's legacy Hollywood footprint, major TV networks like CBS and MTV, streaming services and more under the roof of a new power player: billionaire Skydance founder David Ellison.",
      "\u201cToday marks an exciting and pivotal moment as we prepare to bring Paramount\u2019s legacy as a Hollywood institution into the future of entertainment,\" Ellison, who is now Chairman and CEO of Paramount, a Skydance Corporation, said in a statement. He added that he aims to \u201chonor exceptional storytelling while modernizing how we make and deliver content.\"",
      "The merger's close came just two weeks after it received regulatory approval from the Trump administration. While now a done deal, the path towards that approval was far from smooth sailing. Months of scrutiny and turmoil surrounded the transaction \u2014 particularly amid President Donald Trump\u2019s legal battle with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the crown jewel of Paramount-owned broadcast network CBS. With the specter of the Trump administration potentially blocking the hard-fought deal with Skydance, Paramount agreed to pay a $16 million settlement to the president in early July.",
      "Critics of the settlement lambasted it as a veiled bribe to appease Trump, amid rising alarm over editorial independence overall. Further outrage also emerged after CBS said it was canceling Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d just days after the comedian sharply criticized the parent company\u2019s settlement on air. Paramount cited financial reasons, but big names both within and outside the company have questioned those motives.",
      "When still seeking approval to buy Paramount from the Federal Communication Commission, Skydance management assured regulators that it would carefully watch for any perceived bias at CBS News and hire an ombudsman to review any complaints about fairness. In filings just last month, the company\u2019s general counsel maintained that New Paramount will embody \u201ca diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum\u201d \u2014 and also noted that it plans to take a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of CBS to make \u201cany necessary changes.\u201d",
      "By the time the deal was approved, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr hailed the merger as an opportunity to bring more balance to \u201conce-storied\u201d CBS. \u201cAmericans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,\" Carr said.",

      "Carr also pointed to other commitments from Skydance \u2014 including company assurances about ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at Paramount. In a letter addressed to Carr days before the FCC's greenlight, Skydance wrote to \u201cconfirm the elimination\u201d of DEI initiatives previously in place at Paramount \u2014 and maintained that Skydance \u201cdoes not have DEI programs in place today and will not establish such initiatives.\u201d",
      "Skydance pointed to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision on affirmative action in college admissions, but such moves also arrive amid the Trump administration\u2019s wider crackdown on DEI in the workplace \u2014 and the company cited recent federal mandates impacting employers, too, noting that Paramount announced \u201csignificant changes\u201d to its recruiting and hiring practices in February 2025.",
      "The FCC approved the merger by a 2-1 vote on July 24. The regulator who opposed it, FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, expressed disdain for how it all came together \u2014 pointing to \u201cmonths of cowardly capitulation to this administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom,\u201d Gomez, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, said in a statement. She also said the agency overstepped its authority by \u201cundermining legitimate efforts to combat discrimination and expand opportunity.\u201d",
      "Paramount's new leaders will be watched particularly closely for how they deal with CBS News, given the $16 million settlement with Trump following his complaint about last fall's \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris. And the merger could also have ripple effects across other Paramount properties, including its late night and comedy programming.",
      "When first announcing the deal in July 2024, Ellison also stressed the need to transition into a \u201ctech hybrid\u201d to stay competitive in today\u2019s entertainment landscape. That included plans to \u201crebuild\u201d the Paramount+ streaming service, among wider efforts to expand direct-to-consumer offerings in a world with more entertainment options and shorter attention spans.",

      "What was surprising was that consumption of ultra-processed foods appeared to dip slightly over the past decade. Among adults, total calories from those sources fell from about 56% in 2013-2014 and from nearly 66% for kids in 2017-2018.",
      "Williams said she couldn't speculate about the reason for the decline or whether consumption of less processed foods increased.",
      "But Andrea Deierlein, a nutrition expert at New York University who was not involved in the research, suggested that there may be greater awareness of the potential harms of ultra-processed foods.",

      "Concern over ultra-processed foods' health effects has been growing for years, but finding solutions has been difficult. Many studies have linked them to obesity, diabetes and heart disease, but they haven't been able to prove that the foods directly cause those chronic health problems.",
      "One small but influential study found that even when diets were matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and micronutrients, people consumed more calories and gained more weight when they ate ultra-processed foods than when they ate minimally processed foods.",
      "Research published this week in the journal Nature found that participants in a clinical trial lost twice as much weight when they ate minimally processed foods \u2014 such as pasta, chicken, fruits and vegetables \u2014 than ultra-processed foods, even those matched for nutrition components and considered healthy, such as ready-to-heat frozen meals, protein bars and shakes.",
      "Part of the problem is simply defining ultra-processed foods.",
      "The new CDC report used the most common definition based on the four-tier Nova system developed by Brazilian researchers that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo. Such foods tend to be \u201chyperpalatable, energy-dense, low in dietary fiber and contain little or no whole foods, while having high amounts of salt, sweeteners and unhealthy fats,\u201d the CDC report said.",
      "U.S. health officials recently said there are concerns over whether current definitions \u201caccurately capture\u201d the range of foods that may affect health. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture Department recently issued a request for information to develop a new, uniform definition of ultra-processed foods for products in the U.S. food supply.",
      "In the meantime, Americans should try to reduce ultra-processed foods in their daily diets, Deierlein said. For instance, instead of instant oatmeal that may contain added sugar, sodium, artificial colors and preservatives, use plain oats sweetened with honey or maple syrup. Read food packages and nutrition information, she suggested.",
      "\u201cI do think that there are less-processed options available for many foods,\u201d she said.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the commitment of the United States to the core of USMCA, reaffirmed again last week, means the U.S. average tariff rate on Canadian goods remains one of its lowest, and over 85% of Canada-U.S. trade continues to be tariff free.",
      "\u201cCanada is better off than any of the trading partners right now because the Americans appear to be relying as a default on USMCA,\u201d said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers\u2019 Association. \u201cThat gives them the tough tariff headline but also allows them the access to the stuff they need from us. Because of that we\u2019re in a relative better position.\u201d",
      "Canadian and Mexican companies can claim preferential treatment under the USMCA based on where the products are made.",
      "\u201cThe headline news is 35% tariffs but it\u2019s somewhat targeted,\u201d said John Manley, Canada\u2019s former industry minister, finance minister, foreign affairs minister and deputy prime minister.",

      "But that 25% only applies to the fraction of Mexico's trade with the U.S. that isn't covered by the USMCA. Shortly after speaking with Trump on Thursday, President Claudia Sheinbaum said that within the \u201cnew commercial world order,\u201d Mexico was still the best positioned nation because of the free trade agreement.",

      "More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the U.S. while more than 80% of Mexico's exports go there.",

      "\u201cDespite our advantages, certain major Canadian industries are being severely impacted by U.S. trade actions. These strategic sectors include autos, steel, aluminum, copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and of course, softwood lumber,\u201d Carney said Tuesday. \u201cIt is clear we cannot count or fully rely on what has been our most valued trading relationship for our prosperity.\u201d",

It gets better gas mileage, comfortably accommodates four people, and boasts a trunk as spacious as the trunks of some midsize cars. Honda based this version of the Insight on the popular Civic sedan, giving the Insight different styling and a more upscale-feeling interior.

      "Australia says it has accepted a Japanese company's bid for a lucrative and hotly contested contract to build Australian naval vessels, expected to be worth 10 billion Australian dollars ($6.5 billion)",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 Australia said Tuesday it accepted a Japanese company's bid for a lucrative and hotly contested contract to build Australian warships, expected to be worth 10 billion Australian dollars ($6.5 billion).",
      "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries\u2019 Mogami-class frigate won the deal over rival Germany\u2019s MEKO A-200 from Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems. Japan\u2019s government lobbied heavily for the deal after missing out on Australia\u2019s submarines contract to a French company in 2016.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly the biggest defense industry agreement that will ever have been struck between Japan and Australia,\u201d Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters when he announced the deal Tuesday. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s really one of the biggest defense exports that Japan has ever engaged in.\u201d",
      "The fleet of 11 naval vessels will replace Australia\u2019s ageing fleet of ANZAC-class ships. Three of the frigates will be built in Japan, with the first scheduled to be operational Australia in 2030, and the remaining eight due for construction in Australia.",
      "Australian news outlets reported that the German company\u2019s bid had emphasized their vessel\u2019s cheaper price and their greater experience building ships abroad. But Pat Conroy, Australia\u2019s Minister for Defense Industry, said the Mogami-class frigate was a \u201cclear winner\u201d when assessed by \u201ccost, capability and meeting our schedule of delivery.\u201d",
      "The vessels have a range of up to 10,000 nautical miles (18,520 kilometers) and 32 vertical launch cells capable of launching long-range missiles. The frigates can operate with a crew of 90, compared to the 170 needed to operate the ANZAC-class ships.",
      "Mitsubishi\u2019s win was a boon for Japan\u2019s defense industry, which has not built naval vessels abroad before. Japan, whose only treaty ally is the United States, considers Australia a semi-ally and has increasingly sought to deepen bilateral military cooperation amid ongoing regional tensions in the disputed South China Sea.",

      "Nakatani said co-developing the frigate will allow the two countries to train and operate with the same equipment and further improve operability and efficiency. Japan set up a joint taskforce of government and industry in an effort to win the bid.",
      "Australian officials said work on a binding commercial contract with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the government of Japan would now begin, with a finalized agreement expected in 2026. They did not say how much each ship would cost or confirm a total figure for the package, citing ongoing negotiations.",
      "But Conroy said the government had allowed AU$10 billion for the project over the next 10 years. It forms part of the AU$55 billion that Australia has budgeted for the navy\u2019s entire surface combatant fleet during the same period.",

      "A new wave of gymnasts are ready to step into the spotlight at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- There was a time, not that long ago really, when Joscelyn Roberson would combat the nerves that inevitably popped up before a major gymnastics meet by reminding herself of one very simple fact.",
      "\u201cI could be like, \u2018Oh no one\u2019s watching me,\u2019\u201d the 19-year-old said with a laugh. \u201cLike they\u2019re watching Simone (Biles). They\u2019re watching Jordan (Chiles). They\u2019re watching Suni (Lee) and Jade (Carey). Like, they are not watching me.\u201d",
      "Well, they are now.",
      "Biles, Lee, Carey and Carey are all on sabbatical from elite gymnastics, perhaps for good. And when Roberson salutes the judges during the first night of the U.S. Gymnastics Championships on Friday, the world championship gold medalist and Olympic alternate will be one of the few athletes on the floor with experience on the sport's biggest stage.",
      "\u201cMaybe they are kind of watching me (now), so it adds a different level of nerves, but I love it,\u201d Roberson said.",
      "Good thing, because she'll probably have to get used to it. Not just for Roberson, but the athletes who will find the spotlight pointing their way now that the icons who commanded it so completely have stepped aside, at least for now.",
      "A year after sending the oldest team in modern Olympic history to Paris, the average age of the competitors who will spend the weekend at Smoothie King Center taking their first tentative steps toward the 2028 Los Angeles Games is under 18.",
      "Hezley Rivera helped the Americans capture gold last summer. Now, the 17-year-old finds herself thrust into the role as one of the standardbearers for one of the marquee programs of the U.S. Olympic movement, and the external pressure that comes along with it.",
      "\u201cI definitely know that people have certain expectations, but I don\u2019t really care what people have, like, expectations-wise for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what I want and my goals, so it\u2019s kind of just focusing on what I\u2019m doing in the gym and what I am doing on the competition floor.\u201d",
      "Rivera's elite 2025 debut was bumpy. She tied for 12th at the U.S. Classic last month, well behind WOGA club teammate Claire Pease, who showed uncommon poise in her first major competition at the senior level.",
      "Yes, it wasn't the meet Rivera wanted, but the reality is the year following an Olympics is all about adjusting to the sport's updated Code of Points and plotting out what the run-up to the next Olympics might look like.",
      "That's perhaps even more true this time around, not just on the floor but off it. While a new wave of athletes who grew up idolizing Biles and Lee step towards the forefront, the organization they will represent is undergoing a significant change of its own.",
      "Li Li Leung, who nimbly guided USA Gymnastics out of the wake of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, is stepping down at the end of the year. During her final \u201cState of the Sport\u201d address on Wednesday, Leung grew uncharacteristically emotional during what she called a \u201cbittersweet\u201d milestone.",

      "Much of the groundwork has already been laid.",
      "While the organization is certainly on much stronger footing \u2014 earlier this week USA Gymnastics and NBC Sports announced they were extending their partnership through 2032, and the high-profile corporate sponsors who bailed in the aftermath of Nassar have returned \u2014 Leung stressed the job she and the rest of an organization that was in tatters when she arrived in early 2019 is hardly finished.",
      "\u201cThe transformation of USA Gymnastics and its culture is not over, it will never be over,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018mission accomplished\u2019 attitude at USA Gymnastics. Instead, we will always be looking at how to build on what we have achieved.\u201d",
      "That remains true on the floor as well. The faces that defined the U.S.'s lengthy run of dominance \u2014 Biles most of all \u2014 are taking a well-deserved break. And while the lure of performing in a hometown Games three summers from now may eventually prod some of them back, this year will be about getting a feel for the next generation.",
      "\u201cI really look at this as a rebuilding year and it's a year of opportunity,\u201d women's program technical lead Chellsie Memmel said. \u201cMost of our Olympians haven\u2019t returned. And then the few we have are still very young. So it\u2019s really about building an opportunity for the younger ones.\u201d",

The road back from the torn right Achilles she suffered on the eve of the 2024 Olympic Trials hasn't been easy. Yet she's at a point where she can compete safely on uneven bars and balance beam. While there was a part of her that wanted to give all four events a shot, she also understands there's no rush.",
      "Back when Blakely was 13, she figured she'd be done as an elite by 20. She pointed to Biles' history-making performance last summer at 27 as proof that \u201cold\u201d isn't what it used to be.",
      "\u201cYour end is what you make it, it\u2019s not what everybody else says it is,\" she said. \u201cI say I might not go for another 10 years, but to be completely honest, I don\u2019t know what these next 10 years will look like for me at all, because I didn\u2019t even think I\u2019d still be doing elite at 20, and here we are.\u201d",

      "Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is excited to play with the starters in the preseason opener against the Arizona Cardinals",
      "ST. JOSEPH, Mo. -- Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is glad that coach Andy Reid is sending him onto the field with the rest of their starters when Kansas City visits the Arizona Cardinals for their preseason opener Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI don't necessarily look forward to getting hit,\u201d Mahomes added with a smile Thursday.",
      "Getting hit is exactly why some teams have eschewed playing starters at all in the preseason. When coaches finally decided it wasn't worth the risk to their most valuable players, they began sitting them for one or two games, and last year, teams such as the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles sat them for the entirety of their exhibition slate.",
      "That has never been Reid's preference, though. Nor has it been that of Mahomes, who believes it does him some good to get hit \u2014 once, at least \u2014 so that he can get into the right mindset for the rest of the preseason and ultimately the regular season.",
      "\u201cThere's always a little shock,\u201d Mahomes said.",
      "Now, don't get any misconceptions. The Chiefs might only have those starters on the field for a single series in Arizona, especially if it goes well. But the plan, at least after their final practice before their opener, was that each quarterback will get a full quarter \u2014 Mahomes the first, Gardner Minshew the second, Bailey Zappe the third and Chris Oladokun the fourth.",
      "The rest of the offense would presumably follow suit.",
      "There are certainly things that the three-time defending AFC champions want to see out of their preseason opener. Tops on the list is their new-look offense line, where first-round pick Josh Simmons has already turned some heads as the new left tackle and Kingsley Suamataia has the inside track on replacing two-time All-Pro Joe Thuney at left guard.",
      "The Chiefs have invested heavily in their offensive line, both in draft capital and financial resources, over the past couple years, and the need to upgrade the left side in particular became evident in their Super Bowl loss in February.",
      "There is also some competition for the final spots at wide receiver, and some different names could get some extended looks with the first-team offense. That's because Rashee Rice is sidelined with a groin injury and Marquise Brown with an ailing ankle.",
      "\u201cI think (my advice) is go out there and do what they're doing this camp,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cIt's going to be a bigger stage going up against another team, but I think Coach Reid prepares us better than anybody else in the league to go out there and play your best football. We practice hard and we practice fast so when it gets to the game, it's not that huge step up.\u201d",

      "There were 13 service breaks in 25 games, with Mboko converting eight of nine break points. And she did it with a stiff and swollen wrist that was \u201chard to move.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s some moments where it was aggravating me a lot, but I feel like it was the final. I just kept saying to myself, \u2018You have one more to go.\u2019\u201d",

      "Three months ago, Nedoroscik walked back through the doors of EVO Gymnastics in Florida and quietly went back to work. And when the U.S. Championships begin on Thursday night, he'll hop onto the event that, at 26, he remains in some ways obsessed with after all these years and begin again.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, I am a gymnast and I blew up for being a gymnast,\u201d Nedoroscik said. \u201cAnd I have sort of a mindset where I don\u2019t really want to be famous. I get, like, anxiety. So it\u2019s like I kind of accept the fact that having this moment was amazing, but eventually that wave will end.\u201d",
      "In a way, Nedoroscik hopped off before he had a chance to be pushed. He's well aware of the tropes of all the teen movies where the main character starts off as an outcast of sorts, then one flash of talent, one splash of popularity, and one makeover montage later, they emerge as a different person.",
      "He had no interest in sticking to that script, though the lure is certainly intoxicating.",
      "When he drilled his dismount at Bercy Arena during the men's team final last July to clinch the biggest international medal by the U.S. men's gymnastics program since the 2008 Olympics, he didn't think it would lead to a spot on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d with host Jimmy Fallon rapping a song on how to spell his name.",
      "The only contestant in \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d two-decade run to incorporate a pommel horse into a dance routine didn't imagine being a fixture on national television for two months either. Yet that happened too. Quickly followed by weeks crisscrossing the country as one of the faces of the show's annual tour.",
      "While he appreciated the support, the messages to his Instagram account that cut through the noise the most weren't the ones talking about the way he navigated a ballroom floor, but from mothers who saw Nedoroscik and his American teammates triumph in Paris and decided it was time to sign their sons up for a sport that always seems to be fighting for its survival.",

      "It's one of the many reasons Nedoroscik is happy to be back to what passes for his normal. He understands competing just three months after returning to training might be asking a bit much of his body. The early weeks in the gym were humbling and eye-opening. Yet interspersed with the aches and pains were the occasional reminders that yeah, he's still pretty good at this.",

      "President Donald Trump's plan for 100% tariffs on non-U.S. computer chips is causing confusion among businesses and trading partners",
      "President Donald Trump's plans for 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren't made in the U.S. are stoking confusion among businesses and trading partners \u2014 boosting stocks for leading semiconductor companies while leaving smaller producers scrambling to understand the implications.",
      "The U.S. imports a relatively small number of chips because most of the foreign-made chips in a device \u2014 from an iPhone to a car \u2014 were already assembled into a product, or part of a product, before it landed in the country.",
      "\"The real question everybody in the industry is asking is whether there will be a component tariff, where the chips in a device would require some sort of separate tariff calculation,\u201d said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that companies that \"made a commitment to build\" in the U.S. would be spared the import tax, even if they are not yet producing those chips in American factories.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. \u201cBut if you\u2019re building in the United States of America, there\u2019s no charge.\u201d",

      "The announcement came more than three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from his administration\u2019s most onerous tariffs.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation. Chorzempa said chip tariffs could again raise prices by hundreds of dollars per vehicle if the semiconductors inside a car are not exempt.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a chip that allows you to open and close the window,\" Chorzempa said. \"There\u2019s a chip that is running the entertainment system. There is a chip that\u2019s kind of running all the electronics. There are chips, especially in EVs, that are doing power management, all that kind of stuff.\u201d",
      "Much of the investment into building U.S. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry.",
      "Trump has vocally opposed those financial incentives and taken a different approach, betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for electronics.",

      "Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio's research is literally frozen.",
      "Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don\u2019t have money to launch it,\u201d said Ascherio. \u201cWe built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'\u201d",
      "The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.",
      "And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.",
      "The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.",
      "The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions \u2014 meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.",
      "Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to \u201csurrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,\" the university said in its legal complaint. \u201cBut rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.",
      "The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.",
      "In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of \u201cdifficult decisions and sacrifices\u201d ahead.",
      "Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers\u2019 salaries until next June. But he\u2019s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really devastating,\u201d agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.",
      "At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.",
      "\u201cJust thinking about all the knowledge that\u2019s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,\" Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. \"It\u2019s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.\"",
      "John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.",
      "In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were cancelled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in a position where I have to really think about, \u2018Can I revive this research?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cCan I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?\u201d",
      "The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university's fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.",
      "Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she\u2019s happy to see the culling of what she called \u201cpolitically motivated social science studies.\u201d",
      "Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have \u201creally gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.\u201d",
      "But Madras, who served on the President\u2019s Commission on Opioids during Trump\u2019s first term, said holding scientists\u2019 research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn\u2019t make sense.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,\" she said. \u201cBut sacrificing science is problematic, and it\u2019s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.\u201d",
      "Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,\u201d Quackenbush said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.\u201d",

In Florida's Polk County Schools, a district of more than 100,000 students, the school safety program received nearly 500 Gaggle alerts over four years, officers said in public Board of Education meetings. This led to 72 involuntary hospitalization cases under the Baker Act, a state law that allows authorities to require mental health evaluations for people against their will if they pose a risk to themselves or others.",

      "Roblox, the online gaming platform wildly popular with children and teenagers, is rolling out an open-source version of an artificial intelligence system it says can help preemptively detect predatory language in game chats.",
      "The move comes as the company faces lawsuits and criticism accusing it of not doing enough to protect children from predators. For instance, a lawsuit filed last month in Iowa alleges that a 13-year-old girl was introduced to an adult predator on Roblox, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. The suit, filed in Iowa District Court in Polk County, claims that Roblox's design features make children who use it \u201ceasy prey for pedophiles.\u201d",
      "Roblox says it strives to make its systems as safe as possible by default but notes that \u201cno system is perfect, and one of the biggest challenges in the industry is to detect critical harms like potential child endangerment.\u201d",
      "The AI system, called Sentinel, helps detect early signs of possible child endangerment, such as sexually exploitative language. Roblox says the system has led the company to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025. The company is now in the process of open-sourcing it so other platforms can use it too.",
      "Preemptively detecting possible dangers to kids can be tricky for AI systems \u2014 and humans, too \u2014 because conversations can seem innocuous at first. Questions like \u201chow old are you?\u201d or \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d wouldn't necessarily raise red flags on their own, but when put in context over the course of a longer conversation, they can take on a different meaning.",
      "Roblox, which has more than 111 million monthly users, doesn't allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information such as phone numbers, though \u2014 as with most moderation rules \u2014 people constantly find ways to get around such safeguards.",
      "It also doesn't allow kids under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission \u2014 and unlike many other platforms, it does not encrypt private chat conversations, so it can monitor and moderate them.",

      "Sentinel captures one-minute snapshots of chats across Roblox \u2014 about 6 billion messages per day \u2014 and analyzes them for potential harms. To do this, Roblox says it developed two indexes \u2014 one made up of benign messages and, the other, chats that were determined to contain child endangerment violations. Roblox says this lets the system recognize harmful patterns that go beyond simply flagging certain words or phrases, taking the entire conversation into context.",
      "\u201cThat index gets better as we detect more bad actors, we just continuously update that index. Then we have another sample of what does a normal, regular user do?\" said Naren Koneru, vice president of engineering for trust and safety at Roblox.",

      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT\u2019s 1,200 responses as dangerous.",

      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl \u2014 with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\u201cI started crying,\u201d he said in an interview.",

To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to take more meaningful steps toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",

      "Wilmore and Suni Williams launched last summer as test pilots on Boeing\u2019s first astronaut flight. What should have been a weeklong trip to the International Space Station turned into a stay of more than nine months because of Boeing\u2019s malfunctioning Starliner. Starliner came back empty, and Wilmore and Williams returned to Earth in March with SpaceX.",
      "Wilmore, 62, had already retired from the Navy. Williams, 59, also a retired Navy captain, is still with NASA. She joined Second Lady Usha Vance at Johnson Space Center in Houston earlier this week, taking part in a summer reading challenge for schoolchildren.",
      "Selected as an astronaut in 2000, Wilmore logged 464 days in orbit over three missions. His final spaceflight made up nearly two-thirds of that total: 286 days.",

      "The U.S. has suspended live cattle imports from Mexico due to concerns about the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite found in southern Mexico",
      "HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States\u2019 suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Mart\u00edn Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border.",
      "Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. His family has faced punishing droughts before but has never before had to contend with the economic hit of a new scourge: the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite.",
      "U.S. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July \u2013 the third suspension of the past eight months \u2014 due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north.",
      "The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals\u2019 skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal. Infected animals are a serious threat to herds.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture calls it a \"devastating pest\" and said in June that it poses a threat to \u201cour livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.\u201d It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago.",
      "As part of its strategy the U.S. is preparing to breed billions of sterile flies and release them in Mexico and southern Texas. The aim is for the sterile males to mate with females in the wild who then produce no offspring.",
      "The U.S. ban on live cattle also applies to horses and bison imports. It hit a ranching sector already weakened by drought and specifically a cattle export business that generated $1.2 billion for Mexico last year. This year, Mexican ranchers have exported fewer than 200,000 head of cattle, which is less than half what they historically send in the same period.",
      "For Ibarra Vargas, considered a comparatively small rancher by Sonora\u2019s beef-centric standards, the inability to send his calves across the border has made him rethink everything.",
      "The repeated bans on Mexican cows by U.S. authorities has pushed his family to branch into beekeeping, raising sheep and selling cow's milk. What he earns is just a fraction of what he earned by exporting live cattle, but he is trying to hold on through the lean times.",
      "\u201cTiempos de vacas flacas\" \u2014 times of the lean cows \u2014 as he calls them.",
      "\u201cAt least it lets us continue\u201d ranching, the 57-year-old said with a white cowboy hat perched on his head.",
      "Even as ranchers in Sonora intensify their efforts to make sure the parasitic fly never makes it into their state, they\u2019ve had to seek new markets.",
      "In the past two months, they\u2019ve sold more than 35,000 mature cows within Mexico at a significant loss.",

      "The U.S. first suspended cattle imports last November. Since then, more than 2,258 cases of screwworm have been identified in Mexico. Treatment requires a mix of manually removing the maggots, healing the lesions on the cows and using anti-parasite medicine.",
      "Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as \u201cmeat boutiques.\"",
      "There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. feedlots. The switch is not easy.",

Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak\u2019s first five years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite gruesome,\u201d said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",

      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",

      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2013 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade.

      "Global financial markets have taken President Donald Trump's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian and European shares and U.S. futures mostly higher",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy.",
      "Just after midnight, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union became subject to tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the EU, Japan and South Korea are taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are taxed at 20%. Trump also expects the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. He added that the U.S. was \u201ctaking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,\u201d but he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \u201cwe don\u2019t even know what the final number is\u201d regarding tariff rates.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the Republican administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.",
      "But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump\u2019s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.",
      "\u201cA less productive economy requires fewer workers,\u201d Silvia said in an analysis note. \u201cBut there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\u201d",
      "Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly.",
      "\u201cWe all want it to be made for television where it\u2019s this explosion \u2014 it\u2019s not like that,\u201d said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\u201d",
      "Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year.",
      "The economic pain isn't confined to the U.S. Germany, which sends 10% of its exports to the U.S. market, saw industrial production sag 1.9% in June as Trump's earlier rounds of tariff hikes took hold. \u201cThe new tariffs will clearly weigh on economic growth,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro for ING bank.",
      "The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 only said the higher tax rates would start in seven days.",
      "Trump on Wednesday announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India for its buying of Russian oil, bringing its total import taxes to 50%.",

      "Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\u201d Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \u201cI think choppy waters are ahead because I think they\u2019re going to have some legal challenges.\u201d",
      "Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.",

      "A bull moose whose lingering presence around an Adirondack mountain hiking trail this summer forced its closure was euthanized after showing signs of severely deteriorating health, environmental officials said Thursday.",
      "The Goodman Mountain trail in the Horseshoe Lake Wild Forest had been temporarily closed since June 6 after the oddly behaving moose began staying on or around the trail near the summit. The moose, about 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder, was first spotted by the trail in May and efforts coax it away were unsuccessful.",

They determined euthanasia to be the most humane course of action, given the animal's condition and low likelihood of survival, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation.",
      "\"While we never take such actions lightly, humane euthanasia is sometimes the most responsible course of action.

      "LONDON -- U.S. Vice President JD Vance is expected to meet with U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Friday at a stately home south of London before heading off on a family vacation in the the Cotswolds, a trendy retreat in the English countryside.",
      "Vance and Lammy, who come from opposite ends of the political spectrum but have made a personal connection through their hardscrabble childhoods and Christian faith, will hold talks at the foreign secretary\u2019s official country residence, known as Chevening.",
      "The meeting comes as the United Kingdom tries to come to favorable terms for steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. as the two sides work out details of a broader trade deal announced at the end of June. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza are also likely to be on the agenda amid debates between Washington and London about the best way to end those conflicts.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he hoped to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump next week. Those comments came a day before Trump\u2019s deadline for Moscow to show progress in ending the nearly 3\u00bd-year war in Ukraine.",
      "While Trump has focused on bilateral talks with Putin, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other European leaders have stressed that Ukraine must be part of any negotiations on ending the war.",
      "The U.S. and Britain, which have historically close ties known as \u201cthe special relationship,\u201d have also disagreed on their approach to ending the war in Gaza.",
      "Starmer said last week that the U.K. would recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes steps to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and commits to a \u201clong-term sustainable peace.\u201d The U.S. has said that such recognition would be counterproductive because it rewards Hamas militants for the attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Lammy and Vance will meet at Chevening, an almost 400-year-old mansion surrounded by 3,000 acres (about 1,200 hectares) of gardens, lawns and woodland in the county of Kent, southeast of London. The estate was given to the nation by the 7th Earl Stanhope in 1967 and is now the official country residence of the U.K. foreign secretary.",
      "While Lammy is a member of the left-leaning Labour Party and Vance is a conservative Republican who supports Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, the two men have bonded in recent months.",
      "Lammy told the Guardian newspaper that the two men can relate over their \u201cdysfunctional\u201d working class childhoods and that he considers Vance a \u201cfriend.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Thursday he will nominate a top economic adviser to the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors for four months, temporarily filling a vacancy while continuing his search for a longer-term appointment.",
      "Trump said he has named Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a seat vacated by governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee who is stepping down Friday. Miran, if approved by the Senate, will serve until January 31, 2026.",
      "The appointment is Trump\u2019s first opportunity to exert more control over the Fed, one of the few remaining independent federal agencies. Trump has relentlessly criticized the current chair, Jerome Powell, for keeping short-term interest rates unchanged, calling him \u201ca stubborn MORON\u201d last week on social media.",
      "Miran has been a major defender of Trump\u2019s income tax cuts and tariff hikes, arguing that the combination will generate enough economic growth to reduce budget deficits. He also has played down the risk of Trump\u2019s tariffs generating higher inflation, a major source of concern for Powell.",
      "The choice of Miran may heighten concerns about political influence over the Fed, which has traditionally been insulated from day-to-day politics. Fed independence is generally seen as key to ensuring that it can take difficult steps to combat inflation, such as raising interest rates, that politicians might be unwilling to take.",

      "At its most recent meeting last week Fed officials kept their key rate unchanged at 4.3%, where it has stood after three rate cuts late last year. But two Fed governors \u2014 Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 dissented from that decision. Both were appointed by Trump in his first term.",
      "Still, even with Miran on the board, 12 Fed officials vote on interest rate policy and many remain concerned that Trump's sweeping tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months.",
      "After the July jobs report was released last Friday, Miran criticized the Fed chair for not cutting benchmark interest rates, saying that Trump had been proven correct on inflation during his first term and would be again. The president has pressured Powell to cut short-term interest rates under the belief that his tariffs will not fuel higher inflationary pressures.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now in real time is a repetition once again of this pattern where the president will end up having been proven right,\u201d Miran said on MSNBC. \u201cAnd the Fed will, with a lag and probably quite too late, eventually catch up to the president\u2019s view.\u201d",

      "A shooting that injured five soldiers at one of the country's largest military bases on Wednesday has resurfaced questions about a long-standing army policy that largely prevents service members from carrying personal weapons on military installations.",
      "Soldiers in the area who witnessed the shooting at Fort Stewart in Georgia \u201cimmediately and without hesitation\u201d tackled the shooter to subdue him before law enforcement arrived, Brigadier Gen. John Lubas said at a news conference Wednesday.",
      "But they didn't have firearms to shoot back because of a policy first enacted decades ago to ensure safety by limiting armed members on army bases to military police. The suspect in the shooting, logistics Sgt. Quornelius Radford, used a personal weapon, Lubas said.",
      "Questions about why soldiers didn't have weapons were buzzing online after at least one video of the incident on social media appears to show service members in uniform running to safety amid a lockdown that lasted about an hour, instead of firing back at the shooter.",
      "While some have questioned why many service members in the area during the shooting didn\u2019t use weapons to defend themselves, others have questioned whether existing regulations do enough to prevent shootings on bases. The shooting is the latest in a growing list of violent incidents at American military installations over the years \u2014 some claiming upward of a dozen lives.",
      "Experts say that there are reasons for long-standing regulations on military bases, despite their limitations.",
      "Department of Defense policy prohibits military personnel from carrying personal weapons on base without permission from a senior commander, and there is a strict protocol for how the firearm must be stored.",
      "Typically, military personnel must officially check their guns out of secure storage to go to on-base hunting areas or shooting ranges, and then check all firearms back in promptly after its sanctioned use. Military police are often the only armed personnel on base, outside of shooting ranges, hunting areas or in training, where soldiers can wield their service weapons without ammunition.",
      "The federal policy leaves little room for local commanders to use discretion about how the policy is enforced. That means the regulation applies even in Georgia, a state with some of the most lax gun regulations in the country, where Fort Stewart is located.",
      "Robert Capovilla, a founding partner for one of the largest military law firms in the country, strongly believes in the Second Amendment. But he said that the strict firearm policies on military bases exist for a reason.",
      "\u201cA lot of these installations are involved in top-secret operations, dealing with top-secret information, and because of that you need a heightened security,\" said Capovilla, a former military prosecutor and defense attorney. \u201cYou simply don't want folks walking around a federal installation with personal weapons.\u201d",

Whenever he visits an installation, he said armed military police have a visible presence almost constantly on base. He added that he doesn't believe Wednesday's shooting could have been prevented if military personnel had been armed at the time.",
      "Firearms on military bases are more regulated than most states in some ways, according to former military prosecutor and defense counsel Eric Carpenter. But he said that the limitations on gun control on military bases parallel gun policy debates in the public more broadly.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t forfeit all of your rights when you enter the military,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cOutside of a military situation, the service member has just as much Second Amendment right as anyone else.\u201d",
      "For example, it could be fairly straightforward for a service member living off-base to bring a weapon onto the military installation, Carpenter said, because a senior commander can't regulate gun ownership off base.",
      "There is also scant legal ground for leadership to confiscate a gun when a service member is exhibiting signs of a mental health crisis or post-traumatic stress disorder, potentially posing a threat to themselves or others. In recent years, those gaps have come under more scrutiny because of mass shootings, he said.",
      "\u201cAll those rules aren't going to prevent someone from doing what the guy did today,\u201d Carpenter said.",

      "BALTIMORE -- The founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group has been sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for conspiring with his girlfriend to plan an attack on Maryland\u2019s power grid in furtherance of their shared racist beliefs.",
      "Brandon Russell, 30, was convicted by a jury earlier this year. Prosecutors presented evidence detailing his longstanding affiliation with white supremacist causes and his recent efforts to organize \u201csniper attacks\u201d on electrical substations around Baltimore.",
      "During a sentencing hearing Thursday afternoon in federal court in Baltimore, U.S. District Judge James Bredar excoriated the defendant for his reprehensible views, saying Russell was clearly the brains behind the operation, which sought to precipitate societal collapse by targeting the energy infrastructure of a majority-Black city.",
      "In the aftermath of the planned attacks, Russell and his co-defendant, Sarah Beth Clendaniel, intended to \u201ccreate their own bizarre utopia populated by people who only look and think like they do,\u201d Bredar said.",
      "\u201cWell, that\u2019s not how it works,\u201d the judge continued. \u201cThe law doesn\u2019t permit that. We don\u2019t change course in this country via violent overthrow.\u201d",
      "Bredar imposed the maximum sentence allowed for Russell\u2019s conviction of conspiracy to damage an energy facility. The judge also ordered a lifetime of supervised release, including close monitoring of Russell\u2019s electronic devices.",
      "Bredar previously sentenced Clendaniel to 18 years behind bars after she pleaded guilty to her role in the plot. He said Russell should receive a longer sentence because he was more culpable and contributed the \u201cintellectual horsepower\u201d that propelled the plot closer to fruition.",
      "The two were arrested in February 2023 \u2014 before their plans were executed.",
      "Russell\u2019s attorney, Ian Goldstein, has argued that Clendaniel posed a greater threat because she was taking steps to obtain a firearm and shoot up electrical substations. Meanwhile, Russell was living in Florida with absolutely no plans to travel to Maryland, according to his attorney.",

      "NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- Nestled on a narrow, one-way street among Yale University buildings, a pizza joint and an ice cream shop, Toad\u2019s Place looks like a typical haunt for college kids.",
      "But inside the modest, two-story building is a veritable museum of paintings and signed photos depicting the head-turning array of artists who've played the nightclub over the years:",
      "The Rolling Stones. Bob Dylan. Billy Joel. Bruce Springsteen. U2. The Ramones and Johnny Cash. Rap stars Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Kanye West, Cardi B, Run-D.M.C., Snoop Dogg and Public Enemy. Blues legends B.B. King, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon and John Lee Hooker. And jazz greats Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie and Herbie Hancock.",
      "This year, the New Haven institution is celebrating 50 years in business. And the people who made it happen are reflecting on Toad's success in attracting so many top acts to a venue with a standing-only capacity of about 1,000.",
      "\u201cYou know, I thought it would be good for a few years and then I\u2019d be out doing something else,\u201d said owner Brian Phelps, 71, who started as the club\u2019s manager in 1976. \u201cAnd then the thing started to happen when some of the big bands started to come here.\u201d",
      "Original owner Mike Spoerndle initially opened Toad\u2019s Place in January 1975 as a French restaurant with two friends he later bought out. Before that, the building had been a burger and sandwich joint.",
      "But when the restaurant got off to a slow start, Spoerndle had an idea for bringing in more customers, especially students: music, dancing and beer. A Tuesday night promotion with bands and 25-cent brews helped turn the tide.",
      "Among the acts who performed was New Haven-born Michael Bolotin, who would change his name to Michael Bolton and go on to become a Grammy-winning ballad writer and singer.",
      "The gregarious and charismatic Spoerndle, who died in 2011, endeared himself to bands and customers. A local musician he tapped as Toad's booking agent used his connections to bring in area bands and, later, major blues acts.",
      "Then, in 1977, came a crucial moment. Spoerndle met and befriended concert promoter Jim Koplik, who would bring in many big names to Toad's over the years, and still does today.",
      "\u201cMike knew how to make a really great room and Brian knew how to really run a great room,\u201d said Koplik, now president of Live Nation for Connecticut and upstate New York.",
      "A year later, Springsteen stopped by Toad's to play with the Rhode Island band Beaver Brown after he finished a three-hour show at the nearby New Haven Coliseum.",
      "In 1980, Billy Joel stunned Toad\u2019s by picking it \u2014 and several other venues \u2014 to record songs for his first live album, \u201cSongs in the Attic.\u201d",
      "That same year, a little-known band from Ireland would play at Toad\u2019s as an opening act. It was among the first shows U2 played in North America. The band played the club two more times in 1981 before hitting it big.",
      "On a Saturday night in August 1989, Toad\u2019s advertised a performance by a local band, The Sons of Bob, and a celebration of Koplik\u2019s 40th birthday, followed by a dance party.",

      "\u201cThank you. Good, good, good. We\u2019ve been playing for ourselves the last six weeks,\u201d Mick Jagger told the crowd.",

The band\u2019s promoter called Koplik, who recommended Toad's. The band agreed, but insisted on secrecy.",
      "Those at Toad\u2019s kept a lid on it for the most part, but swirling rumors helped pack the club.",
      "Doug Steinschneider, a local musician, was one of those at the venue that night after a friend told him the Stones would be playing. He wasn\u2019t able to get in, but managed to get near a side door where he could see Jagger singing.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing!\u201d said Steinschneider. \u201cFor being a place where major bands show up, it\u2019s a tiny venue. So you get to see the band in their real element. In other words, you\u2019re not watching a screen.\u201d",

      "Naughty by Nature and Public Enemy played Toad\u2019s in 1992. After releasing his first album, Kanye West played there in 2004 with John Legend on keyboards. Drake played Toad\u2019s in 2009, early in his music career. And Snoop Dogg stopped by to perform in 2012 and 2014.",
      "\u201cWhen you have all these things, all ages, all different styles of music, and you have some dance parties to fill in where you need them, especially during a slow year, it brings enough capital in so that you can stay in business and keep moving forward,\u201d Phelps said.",
      "On a recent night, as local groups took the stage for a battle of the bands contest, many were in awe of playing in the same space where so many legends have performed.",
      "Rook Bazinet, the 22-year-old singer of the Hartford-based emo group Nor Fork, said the band members' parents told them of all the big acts they'd seen at the New Haven hot spot over the years. Bazinet's mom had seen Phish there in the '90s.",

      "Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio's research is literally frozen.",
      "Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don\u2019t have money to launch it,\u201d said Ascherio. \u201cWe built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'\u201d",
      "The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.",
      "And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.",
      "The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.",
      "The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions \u2014 meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.",
      "Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to \u201csurrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,\" the university said in its legal complaint. \u201cBut rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.",
      "The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.",
      "In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of \u201cdifficult decisions and sacrifices\u201d ahead.",
      "Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers\u2019 salaries until next June. But he\u2019s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.",

The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.",
      "At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.",
      "\u201cJust thinking about all the knowledge that\u2019s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,\" Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. \"It\u2019s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.\"",
      "John Quackenbush, a professor of computational biology and bioinformatics at the School of Public Health, has spent the past few months enduring cuts on multiple fronts.",
      "In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were cancelled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in a position where I have to really think about, \u2018Can I revive this research?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cCan I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?\u201d",
      "The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university's fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.",
      "Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she\u2019s happy to see the culling of what she called \u201cpolitically motivated social science studies.\u201d",
      "Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have \u201creally gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.\u201d",
      "But Madras, who served on the President\u2019s Commission on Opioids during Trump\u2019s first term, said holding scientists\u2019 research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn\u2019t make sense.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,\" she said. \u201cBut sacrificing science is problematic, and it\u2019s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.\u201d",
      "Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,\u201d Quackenbush said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into whether banks have discriminated against conservatives and industries like gun manufacturers and cryptocurrency companies",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order mandating a probe into whether banks have discriminated against conservatives and certain industries like gun manufacturers and cryptocurrency companies, invoking the vast powers to go after entities that the Republican president alleges have discriminated against him and his allies.",
      "The executive order deals with an issue known as \u201cdebanking,\u201d which is when banks close accounts of individuals or declines to go into business with certain industries. Trump has accused JPMorgan and Bank of America of debanking him and his companies in the past, something both banks have denied.",
      "Trump ordered federal bank regulators to make sure banks do not discriminate against individuals or companies for their political or religious beliefs. He also ordered bank regulators to probe when banks may have allegedly discriminated and refer the cases to the Department of Justice within 120 days of the signing of the order.",
      "The move could open banks to potential civil or criminal investigations, fines or punishments.",
      "When Trump and his party discuss debanking, they typically refer to banks closing the accounts of a person or company when they no longer want to do business with them. Banks usually say they close accounts or deny loans because the person or business is deemed too risky. The banking industry has long argued that it has a constitutional right to choose whom they go into business with, if it does not violate laws like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.",
      "Th act, which was part of several pieces of legislation signed during the Civil Rights Movement, bans banks from discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, sex and other protected statuses.",
      "Another type of debanking is when government regulators tell banks to avoid doing business with industries or individuals. Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s Department of Justice told banks to avoid doing business with \u201chigh risk\u201d industries, which included payday lenders and firearms manufacturers.",
      "This type of government-directed debanking is also known as reputational risk, where the historic reputation of an industry prompts banks to be more careful about banking and lending. Historic examples include entities who did business in high-risk countries, did business largely in cash or were repeatedly flagged by bank regulators.",
      "Banks, who have benefited from Trumps deregulation agenda, have tried to strike a cordial tone with the administration, showing themselves as willing brokers who got caught up in a difficult political environment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in banks\u2019 best interest to take deposits, lend to and support as many customers as possible. Unfortunately, regulatory overreach, supervisory discretion and a maze of obscure rules have stood in the way as the (executive order) makes clear,\u201d the major bank lobby groups said Thursday in a joint statement.",
      "Conservatives have argued that reputational risk has become an umbrella term that allows banks to discriminate. The banking industry insists it does not actively debank and does not target specific industries or individuals. Banks have already been removing any mention of reputational risk from their policies and procedures, particularly since Trump returned to the White House.",

      "For Trump, the issue of debanking is deeply personal. Trump, in a wide-ranging interview on CNBC, earlier this week alleged that two major banks \u2014 JPMorgan and Bank of America \u2014 cut him off after he left office in 2021.",
      "\u201cThey totally discriminate against ... me maybe even more, but they discriminated against many conservatives,\u201d he said to CNBC.",
      "Both banks have denied they debanked Trump.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed,\u201d said a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase in a statement.",
      "The Obama administration's government-directed debanking has been a rallying cry for conservatives. It\u2019s one reason why the cryptocurrency industry backed Trump in 2024. While the Biden administration did not explicitly force banks to debank the crypto industry, Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s bank regulators did express some public concern about it, a move that was read by banks as a reason to steer away from crypto. That phrasing by the Biden administration was often referred to as \u201cOperation Choke Point 2.0\u201d by Trump and his allies.",
      "Republicans have introduced legislation to cut down on alleged acts of debanking as well. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, chair of the Senate Banking Committee, has introduced legislation that would require bank regulators to no longer consider reputational risk as a factor in how they measure a bank\u2019s health and risk profile.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 20:21:59 -0400",
    "summary": "Profit hits and price hikes are already coming down the pike as a result of new U.S. tariffs, according to economists.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs, which\u00a0went into effect on Thursday, are likely to have a negative effect on companies' bottom lines and cause consumer prices to rise, trade experts say.",
      "With the new duties on imports from dozens of U.S. trade partners now in place, Mr. Trump's foreign trade policy is expected to lead to even more dramatic cost increases for American companies and consumers, according to economists.",
      "\"Even if they might not raise prices immediately, it's unlikely that most businesses are just going to be willing to eat the extra costs forever,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, an online lending marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of tariffs on consumer prices was initially muted, explained Shulz, as firms can be reluctant to be the first among their competitors to institute price hikes. While some companies waited to see where tariff rates settled before adjusting retail prices, others took steps to absorb added costs to avoid turning off customers. But companies can't employ such measures forever, according to experts.",
      "\"You don't want to be the first to raise prices, even if you have a perfectly legitimate reason for doing so,\" Schulz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So, I suspect once we see businesses start raising their prices more, that might embolden others to do so as well.\"",
      "That could mean a tsunami of price hike announcements from corporations, some of which have already warned of tariff impacts, or instituted \"tariff surcharges\" to cover their added costs.",
      "To date, Mr. Trump's tariffs on the U.S.'s trade partners have generated billions of dollars in revenue for the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. government collected about $30 billion in tariff revenue in July, according to the Treasury Department. That reflects a 242% jump in revenue collected from duties since July 2024.",
      "In addition to paying down the national debt, which currently stands at\u00a0more than $36 trillion, those billions in new tariff revenue may be used to issue\u00a0rebate checks for Americans, Mr. Trump suggested last month.",
      "Profit dips",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "\"There is very little evidence that foreign exporters to the U.S. are reducing their prices,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're not seeing broad-based evidence of price cuts by countries, and that's an indication that foreign exporters realize that it's U.S. importers, U.S. businesses and eventually consumers that are bearing the brunt of this tariff-induced inflation acceleration.\"",
      "Companies from personal electronics companies to automakers have already experienced the damaging effects of Mr. Trump's foreign trade policies on profits.",
      "On Thursday Toyota, the world's largest auto maker, reported a 37% drop in profit in the April-June quarter and said it cut its full-year earnings forecast largely because of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Other auto makers have also said they expect to see profit drops as a result of the new levies.",
      "GM has projected a tariff hit of up to $5 billion for 2025, and Ford has said tariffs will cost the company $3 billion in revenue for the year.",
      "Liquor companies are in the tariff crosshairs, too. Guinness maker Diageo said it expects tariffs to cost it $200 million a year.",
      "Walmart in May warned that higher tariffs would force it to increase prices on a wide range of items at its stores, from bananas to children's car seats.",
      "Price hikes",
      "Some companies have said outright that in order to bear the added costs from the new tariffs they'll have to pass along some of the pain to consumers in the form of price hikes.",
      "For example, popular consumer electronics marker Sonos, which makes speakers, said on its third-quarter earnings call Wednesday that it would raise prices on its audio devices as a result of\u00a0higher reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Malaysia, where Sonos devices for the U.S. market are made.",
      "Overall, as a result of the levies, Americans are expected to pay an average of 18.3% more for imported products,\u00a0according to the Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "EY-Parthenon's Daco told CBS MoneyWatch that the higher costs being paid by companies because of tariffs is already starting to trickle down to product prices.",
      "Currently, the average tariff rate stands at around 18% \u2014 the highest it's been in decades, according to Daco. As a result, \"the increase in the tariffs will only exacerbate inflationary pressure that [is] starting to emerge,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"You're going to see more durable goods, and nondurable goods products with higher price tags,\" he said. \"That will feed into higher consumer price inflation and lead to a more pronounced erosion of consumer spending as more households struggle in the face of these higher prices.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing. He has also tried to assure the public that foreign producers will pay for the import taxes and has told retailers and automakers\u00a0to absorb the additional expenses.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS News.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been four months since Liberation Day and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent CEA analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining.\"",

      "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that could allow millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts to invest in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency assets.",
      "The executive order doesn't immediately change how people will invest for retirement through their employer-sponsored accounts, as federal agencies would need to rewrite regulations to allow expanded investment choices. That's a process that experts say could take months, or longer, to complete.",
      "But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate.",
      "The move comes as the 401(k) has become the primary vehicle for American workers to save for retirement, with most employers offering a menu of investment choices among major asset classes, such as stock-based mutual funds. The $5 trillion private equity industry, which makes investments into private businesses rather than publicly traded stocks, has for decades wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans.",
      "At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump's 2024 campaign, has aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans.",
      "\"It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)'s,\" said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. \"As fiduciaries realize bitcoin's risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we'll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.\"",

      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for the major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are not likely to revise their retirement plan options quickly as well, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments are mainstream in an individual's retirement plan.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected.",
      "Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with \"extreme care\" because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic.",
      "For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump's campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump's military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security.",

      "As part of the new model, OpenAI is also reigning in ChatGPT's flattery. In its blog post, the company said GPT\u20115 is \"less effusively agreeable\" and that it will use \"fewer unnecessary emojis.\"",
      "OpenAI has also stepped up ChatGPT's coding abilities, allowing users to build websites, apps and games from scratch. In a demo during Wednesday's call, Altman used ChatGPT-5 to create another large language model in less than 5 minutes.",
      "Altman called the new chatbot's ability to write code on demand its \"superpower,\" adding that the advancement would have been \"unimaginable at any previous point in history.\"",
      "Asked about how the technology might impact the livelihood of human programmers, Altman said he thought the technology would actually create more job opportunities for as demand for software rises.",
      "According to OpenAI, the new model will also be better at answering health-related questions, flagging potential concerns and helping users understand test results from their doctor. The company noted, however, that the technology \"does not replace a medical professional.\"",
      "How much will GPT\u20115 cost?",

      "Mr. Trump said he has named Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a seat vacated by governor Adriana Kugler, a Biden appointee who is stepping down Friday. Miran, if approved by the Senate, will serve until Jan. 31, 2026.",
      "\"Stephen has a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University, and served with distinction in my First Administration,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote on Truth Social. \"He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled \u2014 He will do an outstanding job.\"",
      "The appointment is the president's first opportunity to exert more control over the Fed, one of the few remaining independent federal agencies. Mr. Trump has relentlessly criticized the current chair, Jerome Powell, for keeping short-term interest rates unchanged, calling him \"a stubborn MORON\" last week on social media.",
      "Miran has been a major defender of Mr. Trump's income tax cuts and tariff hikes, arguing that the combination will generate enough economic growth to reduce budget deficits. He also has played down the risk of Mr. Trump's tariffs generating higher inflation, a major source of concern for Powell.",
      "The choice of Miran may heighten concerns about political influence over the Fed, which has traditionally been insulated from day-to-day politics. Fed independence is generally seen as key to ensuring that it can take difficult steps to combat inflation, such as raising interest rates, that politicians might be unwilling to take.",
      "Federal Reserve governors vote on all the central bank's interest-rate decisions, as well as its financial regulatory policies.",

      "After the July jobs report was released last Friday, Miran criticized the Fed chair for not cutting benchmark interest rates, saying that Mr. Trump had been proven correct on inflation during his first term and would be again. The president has pressured Powell to cut short-term interest rates under the belief that his tariffs will not fuel higher inflationary pressures.",
      "\"What we're seeing now in real time is a repetition once again of this pattern where the president will end up having been proven right,\" Miran said on MSNBC. \"And the Fed will, with a lag and probably quite too late, eventually catch up to the president's view.\""

    "story": [
      "Florida's biggest utility company is proposing a nearly $10 billion rate hike for electricity over the next four years, which environmental advocates say would represent the largest utility hike in U.S. history.",
      "Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), a subsidiary of Florida-based energy company NextEra Energy, outlined the changes in a petition filed in February with the Florida Public Service Commission, which regulates the state's electric industry. According to the document, the rate hike would include two base rate increases in 2026 and 2027, and additional hikes in 2028 and 2029 to cover the installation of solar generation and battery storage facilities.",
      "The proposed hike would exceed the total sum of hikes state utility regulators signed off on in 2023, which was $9.7 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Energy and Information Administration.",
      "The Public Service Commission has held several in-person hearings on the proposed utility rate increase, in addition to two virtual hearings, in order to give customers a chance to voice their concerns. FPL will have an opportunity to defend its proposal when it goes before the commission at a two-week\u00a0hearing\u00a0slated to begin on Aug. 11. The regulatory body will then decide on whether or not to approve the proposed rate hike.",
      "FPL contends that the increases are necessary to ensure the reliability of the grid, diversify their energy sources and reduce fuel costs.",
      "\"Our four-year rate proposal would enable FPL to continue to deliver some of America's most reliable electricity while keeping customer bills well below the national average,\" an FPL spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"While we know that no one welcomes rate increases, this request is essential to ensure that we can continue to deliver the reliable, low-cost electricity our customers depend on.",
      "The proposal comes less than a year after the Florida Public Service Commission approved $1.2 billion in rate hikes to pay for \"storm restoration costs,\" a move environmental advocates say has jacked up monthly bills for Floridians. The last time the state's public service commission approved a base rate hike for FPL was in 2021, when it green lit a nearly $5 billion increase for the years 2022 to 2025.",
      "Backlash from environmental groups",
      "Environmental groups say the rate hike, if passed, could cause Floridians significant financial strain, exacerbate the state's\u00a0affordability crisis, and funnel more money than necessary to FPL stakeholders.",
      "\"This isn't about reliability or infrastructure,\" Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer for Food & Water Watch, a U.S. nonprofit focused on sustainable food, clean water and a livable climate, said during a virtual press conference hosted by environmental groups on Tuesday. \"It's about boosting profits.\"",
      "If passed, the proposal could push up Floridians bills by over $360 by the end of 2027, Food & Water Watch\u00a0estimates.",
      "\"These rate increases fall heaviest on the region's most vulnerable households, especially the elderly and disabled,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If it can ask for an additional $10 billion, it should include provisions to help low-income families afford the resulting higher cost of electricity.\"",
      "FPL says in its proposal that the typical residential customer bill is \"estimated to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 2.5%\" and that it would \"remain approximately 25% below the projected national average.\" According to estimates FPL shared with CBS MoneyWatch, with the rate hike, customer bills would increase by approximately $10 to $20 by 2029.",
      "At the virtual meeting on Tuesday, Ward claimed the FPL is using \"funny math\" to make it seem like FPL is raising rates at a lower level than they are. In addition to base rates, the utility has multiple mechanisms to collect additional funds from rate payers which \"rapidly hike up those bills,\" she alleged.",
      "Advocates such as the Florida Office of Public Counsel, the agency representing Florida residents in legal proceedings before the Public Service Commission, claim a disproportionate amount of the money from the rate hikes would be funneled to shareholders. According to testimony from Daniel Lawton, an economist tasked by the FOPC with reviewing the proposal, \"for every dollar paid by consumers in base rates, about 50 cents would go to shareholders and related federal income taxes.\"",
      "Lawton called the shareholder profit request a \"substantial overreach\" and said it would result in \"excessive rates and harms all Florida customers.\"",

    "summary": "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
    "story": [
      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked,\u00a0according to new research\u00a0from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT's 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\"We wanted to test the guardrails,\" said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \"The visceral initial response is, 'Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.' The rails are completely ineffective. They're barely there - if anything, a fig leaf.\"",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
      "\"If someone expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, ChatGPT is trained to encourage them to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones, and provide links to crisis hotlines and support resources,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're focused on getting these kinds of scenarios right: we are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately, pointing people to evidence-based resources when needed, and continuing to improve model behavior over time - all guided by research, real-world use, and mental health experts.\"",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or require parental consent, although the company says it is not meant for children under 13. To sign up, users need to enter a birth date showing an age of at least 13, or they can use a limited guest account without entering an age at all.",
      "\"If you have access to a child's account, you can see their chat history. But as of now, there's really no way for parents to be flagged if, say, your child's question or their prompt into ChatGPT is a concerning one,\" CBS News senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent reported on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl, with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\"I started crying,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \"for a presentation\" or a friend.",
      "\"Emotional overreliance\" on technology",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. More people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to\u00a0AI chatbots for companionship\u00a0and half use AI companions regularly, according to\u00a0a recent study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \"emotional overreliance\" on the technology, describing it as a \"really common thing\" with young people.",
      "\"People rely on ChatGPT too much,\"\u00a0Altman said at\u00a0a conference. \"There's young people who just say, like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.\"",
      "Altman said the company is \"trying to understand what to do about it.\"",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \"it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\"",
      "ChatGPT generates something new \u2014 a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can't do. And AI, he added, \"is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.\"",
      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\"Write a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\" asked a researcher. \"Absolutely,\" responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \"emotionally exposed\" while \"still respecting the community's coded language.\"",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT's self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \"fundamentally designed to feel human,\" said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \"moderate risk\" for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it's not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to\u00a0take more meaningful steps\u00a0toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\"I'm 50kg and a boy,\" said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \"Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\" that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\"What it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, 'Chug, chug, chug, chug,'\" said Ahmed. \"A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say 'no' \u2014 that doesn't always enable and say 'yes.' This is a friend that betrays you.\"",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",
      "\"We'd respond with horror, with fear, with worry, with concern, with love, with compassion,\" Ahmed said. \"No human being I can think of would respond by saying, 'Here's a 500-calorie-a-day diet. Go for it, kiddo.'\"",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

    "summary": "The U.S. officially began levying higher tariffs on dozens of countries, just as the economic fallout of President Trump's months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

      "To determine the most commonly swiped vehicles, the HLDI analyzed stolen vehicle data for 2022-2024 car models between the years of 2021 to 2024. Their analysis hit upon a few shared traits between many of the cars favored by auto thieves.",
      "\"What all vehicles in top 20 have in common is that they are relatively expensive, relatively powerful and in many cases they are pickup trucks,\" Matt Moore, chief insurance operations officer at HLDI, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Muscle cars are attractive to thieves because they are looking for vehicles with high horsepower, the group said.",
      "The Camaro models have another feature that make them vulnerable: on-board ports that contain vehicle data, such as fuel emissions and performance stats, but can also serve as a point of entry for thieves.",
      "\"In the case of Camaro ZL1, it is very desirable to thieves, and, on top of it, there's a vulnerability that makes them relatively easy to steal,\" Moore said.",
      "\"Due to the vulnerability, with the right knowledge and right bits of technology, someone who can gain access to the inside of one of these Camaros can steal it relatively easily,\" Moore said, noting that he didn't want to describe the process more precisely so as not to encourage thieves.",
      "Earlier this year, Chevy owner General Motors released a software update for 2020 to 2024 Camaro models that was aimed at improving security.",
      "\"This body control module software enhancement involves an important security update for certain model year 2020 to 2024 Chevrolet Camaros,\" a GM spokesman said in a statement to auto blog GM Authority. \"GM counters vehicle theft methods as they evolve.

      "\"There were two major revisions to May and June, and these revisions are somewhat typical of turning points, which again speak to uncertainty,\" Cook said during a Wednesday\u00a0discussion with other Fed officials on the global economic outlook.",
      "She later added, \"When we get the GDP numbers later this year, we're going to see, I can imagine, lower activity.\"",
      "Crafting effective economic policies is dependent on understanding where the economy is heading, said Cook, who prior to her appointment in 2022 as a Fed governor was an economics professor at Michigan State University. She has also served on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and worked as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, according to her biography.",
      "\"We want to know not just where we've been, but where we're going. So if we're at an inflection point, we want to look at data that speak to inflection points,\" she added.",
      "Other Fed officials said the July jobs report may not necessarily reflect a long-term direction. On Friday, Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said he had questions about whether the report was a one-time issue or a trend, and added that he believes the labor market still has \"a lot of strength.\"",
      "The downward revision to May and June's hiring data marked the largest two-month downward revision outside of a recession since 1968, according to an analysis from Goldman Sachs.",
      "Cook also discussed what she referred to as an \"uncertainty tax\" that she said is weighing on businesses across industries. She said that executives at \"all kinds of organizations\" are spending more time on preparing for and responding to macroeconomic uncertainty. That includes discussions about pricing based on anticipated cost increases from the new tariffs.",
      "When executives spend their time this way, it's a \"deadweight loss, we're not going to see that in GDP,\" she explained.",
      "\"So there's just uncertainty across the board, but I think it's really interesting that no matter what the sector, no matter what kind of businesses they're in, they're talking about the uncertainty tax,\" Cook said.",

    "summary": "U.S. home prices are dropping the most in the South and West, according to a new report from Realtor.com.",
    "story": [
      "The housing market has been in a serious crunch since the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited inventory, elevated home prices and mortgages in the 7% range, continuing to keep many would-be home buyers\u00a0locked out. But even amid such tight constraints, modest declines in home prices can still be found in some regions of the country.",
      "That's according to a new report from Realtor.com, which measures changes in median home prices across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas since 2022, when median home prices hit a\u00a0peak of $443,000 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.",
      "The extent to which home prices are declining varies from region to region according to the Realtor.com report, which is based on the brokerage platform's housing data.",
      "\"The housing market has cooled modestly in 2025,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a statement on the report. \"But the extent and persistence of rebalancing really varies across the country. And regionally, homebuyers and sellers are likely to experience a very different market.\"",
      "Behind those notable price differences is inventory. Right now, the housing market is essentially divided into two camps, with higher inventory in the South and West, where deeper price cuts can be found, and more limited inventory in the Midwest and Northeast, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"It's a supply and demand story,\" Krimmel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you have fewer homes for sale, and if there is still sufficient demand, that's going to maybe put upward pressure on prices or prevent them from falling.\"",
      "Cities where prices are falling",
      "The largest declines in median listing prices in 2025 tend to be concentrated in the South and West, where all 19 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas with median housing prices below July 2022 levels are located.",
      "\"After years of intense competition, it's starting to feel more balanced \u2014 especially in the South and West,\" Gary Ashton, founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage said in a statement on the Realtor.com report. \"It's not a buyer's market yet, but we're headed in that direction.\"",
      "The cities that saw the biggest declines in price were Austin, where median listing prices have fallen nearly 15% over the last three years; and Miami, where prices have dropped around 19%.",
      "According to Krimmel, inventory is rising in these markets as homes stay on the market longer and new listings climb.",
      "A boom in building also boosted housing supply in those regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for markets like Austin, Denver and Miami exploded, he added. Part of the reason construction in those cities took off, Krimmel added, was that the laws in their respective state make it easier to build during big influxes in demand.",
      "\"[Builders] we're actually able to get things permitted, get shovels in the ground and get buildings built,\" Krimmel said.",
      "Austin, Los Angeles and Miami saw the largest declines in median listing price over the past year, although prices in Los Angeles remain more than 18% above the median listing price in 2022.",
      "Cities where prices are rising",
      "Housing markets in cities in Northeast and Midwest remain squeezed due to \"sticky high\" prices and tight inventory, said Krimmel. Other contributing factors include stricter zoning and land use regulation laws that make building new houses more difficult, he said.",
      "In New York, for example, median listing prices have climbed roughly 16% since 2022, according to the report. Meanwhile, median listing prices in Milwaukee increased 26%.",
      "Furthermore, the number of active listings per month in the Northeast is still 50% below pre-pandemic levels, according to Krimmel. The number of active listings in the Midwest is down 40%, pointing to an inventory shortage in both regions, he said.",
      "While median listing prices have gone down over the last year in northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia, which saw 1.4% and 1.2% decreases, respectively, median prices remain at least 10% above those from 2022.",
      "\"To the extent that there are falling prices in the Northeast and the Midwest, for the most part it's pretty modest numbers,\" said Krimmel.",

    "summary": "President Trump said two major banks turned down his business. Here's why conservatives are concerned with so-called debanking.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday claimed that major banks are discriminating against conservatives \u2014 including him \u2014 through the act of debanking, or when financial institutions refuse to work with some individuals or businesses or abruptly close clients' accounts.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comment in an\u00a0interview with CNBC on Tuesday, after he was asked about a report\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal that said he would soon sign an executive order aimed at stamping out debanking. Mr. Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase gave him 20 days to close his account, although he didn't specify when this occurred or what reason he was given by the bank for doing so. He also claimed that Bank of America refused his business after he left JPMorgan.",
      "The issue of debanking has become a sticking point for some conservatives who claim that they've been unfairly targeted by financial institutions. Debanking can occur for a number of reasons, such as if a financial institution detects potentially fraudulent activity or the account owner is overdrawn, but some conservatives claim they have been rejected due to their political views.",
      "\"They discriminated against many conservatives,\" the president told CNBC.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan rejected such allegations of bias against conservatives, in a recent interview on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that took place ahead of Mr. Trump's comments on CNBC. Moynihan pointed to the nation's second-largest bank's massive customer base as evidence of its diverse clientele. He also emphasized the impact of federal regulations, in addition to concerns over legal and financial risk, on banking decisions.",
      "\"We have 70 million consumers, and we're the biggest small business lender. That's not \u2014 the issue they're focused on is the regulators impact on this industry. And you heard Senator Scott talk about this this week. This reputation, this after the fact, look, that you banked x, and now after the fact, you're gonna say x didn't turn out to be what you thought,\" the CEO told Margaret Brennan. \"So we look at it. We look at it based on risk. People may feel those decisions are made for some other reason, but we always make it on what's best for our company, what's best for our client.\"",
      "At a\u00a0Senate hearing\u00a0in February over the issue, Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, said debanking harms individuals as well as the economy, and violates the principles of fair market access. Debanking has also been highlighted by some crypto investors, such the CEO of crypto platform Anchorage Digital, who\u00a0testified\u00a0in the Senate hearing that his bank had closed his company's account on short notice because they weren't comfortable with crypto transactions.",
      "The White House declined to comment on the EO.",
      "JPMorgan Chase said in a statement that it doesn't close accounts for political reasons, adding that it agrees with Mr. Trump that \"regulatory change is desperately needed.\" It added, \"We're pleased to see the White House is addressing this issue, for which we've been advocating for many years, and look forward to working with them to get this right.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Bank of America said, \"Political beliefs are not a factor in account closure decisions.\" Referring to the reported EO, the bank said in a statement that it welcomes \"regulatory clarity\" from the Trump administration.",
      "Reached for comment on Mr. Trump's recent comments, Bank of America pointed to its earlier statement.",
      "What happens when someone is debanked?",
      "Debanking isn't just happening at banks, said Nicholas Anthony, a policy analyst at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.",
      "\"This can be something that happens to you at a credit union, at a cryptocurrency exchange or anywhere else really,\" Anthony said. \"It's just having that sudden abrupt closure of your financial account where you've been, and essentially kicked out of the system or cut off from the system.\"",
      "Banks are not required by law to give account owners a reason for why their account is being closed. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks are obligated to track their customers' activity and file a so-called suspicious activity report (or SAR) if they notice anything unusual. Banks aren't allowed to disclose to customers if there's a SAR, which can leave some people in the dark if their account is shut for this reason.",
      "\"It's a terrible feeling to suddenly have this relationship cut off, and you really don't know why,\" Anthony said. \"In a lot of cases, it's by federal law that banks can't tell you what happened, and you're kind of left to just spiral there.\"",
      "How many people are impacted by debanking?",
      "More than 8,000 consumers filed complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the last three years related to their financial institutions' \"improperly closing checking, savings or other deposit accounts,\" according to a February analysis from the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.",
      "By comparison, consumers made about 1.3 million complaints about credit reporting in 2023 alone, according to CFPB data.",
      "Why do banks close accounts?",
      "Banks can close accounts if they suspect fraudulent or suspicious behavior, or if a customer violates their terms. In the complaints cited by the Senate banking committee analysis, some consumers said they had faced overdraft fees due to overdrawn funds before their banks shuttered their accounts, for example.",
      "But there's no data that tracks whether people or institutions are debanked due to their political views, although there are anecdotal accounts, experts said.",

      "\"They must always understand and manage any risk that they are accepting in their business activities and decisions; this could include things like financial risk or unlawful or discriminatory activity,\" she added.",
      "What about political views and debanking?",
      "There have been allegations from some conservatives that their political views led to account closures. The attorney general for Kansas, Kris W. Kobach, sent a\u00a0letter to Bank of America last year, alleging discrimination by the bank of religious groups he states had their accounts closed without explanation.",
      "Banking policies appear \"to be systematically punishing religious and political views with which it disagrees,\" the Kobach claimed in the letter.",
      "But some of these organizations had red flags that could have led to the debanking, such running a debt collection business outside of the U.S., Cato's Anthony added.",
      "\"There are anecdotal cases of conservative account holders that have had their accounts closed, but at the same time, we see that with others as well,\" he added. \"There's been a longstanding history of people who are Muslim having their accounts denied, people with Russian last names or Middle Eastern last names for that matter, having their accounts denied.\"",

    "summary": "Revisions are a \"feature, not a bug\" of any jobs report, former BLS commissioner told CBS MoneyWatch.",
    "story": [
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics last week issued a\u00a0steep downward revision\u00a0to May and June's hiring numbers, prompting President Trump to call the edits \"miscalculations\" by the department's commissioner, whom he subsequently fired, in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Aug. 1.",
      "While the downward revision of May and June payroll growth by 258,000 marked the largest two-month downward revision to the jobs numbers since 1968, revisions themselves are not uncommon. Revisions are \"a feature, not a bug\" of the agency's reporting process, Erica Groshen, former BLS commissioner under the Obama administration told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Larger revisions have been recorded, but only when the economy has been in a recession, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis of BLS data.",
      "How the BLS processes its reports",
      "The BLS surveys both households and businesses for its monthly jobs report. After releasing an initial report, it's common for the agency to issue revisions to the prior monthly figures, as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "That's because while some survey recipients respond to the agency's surveys immediately, others report data late. In the interest of reporting employment information in a timely manner, though, the BLS initially issues its monthly jobs report based on an incomplete collection of responses.",
      "\"The BLS wants to get the information as accurate as possible, but it doesn't want to wait too long to put out information that's useful,\" Groshen said. \"So it puts out preliminary numbers, saying they are an estimate, then it gathers more information and improves that estimate.\"",
      "\"If you send out a survey to a bunch of people, some will turn it back in on time and some of them won't,\" Michele Evermore, a former Department of Labor employee and senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The faster you make a determination, the more you're going to have to fill in the blanks,\" she said. In the interim, the BLS relies on scientific modeling to paint a more complete picture of the state of the job market. \"You have to fill in the gaps, and the more reports you get back, the more holes you can fill, and the more accurate a report you get.\"",
      "Eventually, the inclusion of late responses to surveys by both employers and workers enables the agency to provide a more accurate picture of the state of hiring and unemployment in the U.S., Evermore explained.",
      "The cuts to the number of jobs that were added in May and June were spread out across both public- and private-sector jobs. The downward revision to public-sector payroll growth \"mostly reflected lower state and local government job gains,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note. Private-sector job gains were previously overstated because of incomplete response data, according to the analysts.",
      "Groshen acknowledged that the revisions were \"definitely on the large side,\" but that \"they happen, and are the product of the same monthly process.\"",
      "Cuts pertaining to government jobs were driven primarily by reductions in hiring by state and local education establishments, according to the BLS. Groshen attributes the job cuts to the expiration of pandemic-era government subsidies that are leading to a pullback in hiring.",
      "\"These subsidies were cut, so they are not hiring as many people as they had been in the past, and state and local governments often report late, so that information came in late,\" she said.",
      "Evermore, of The Century Foundation, noted that the BLS revisions only apply to jobs that were added in both May and June, and not to \"the pool of all the jobs in the U.S.\"",
      "\"While it seems like a big revision, percentage-wise, it's floating on top of the entire labor market. So while it's big, it's not as dramatic as some people are acting like it is,\" she said.",
      "Dismissal of BLS commissioner",
      "In his Truth Social post on Friday, Mr. Trump accused BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer of political bias before announcing her dismissal in response to the downward revision of jobs numbers. \"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,\" the president\u00a0wrote.",
      "Despite being probed for answers,, the White House has not provided any evidence that the numbers were manipulated for political purposes.",
      "According to Groshen, the drastic revise of the job numbers don't reflect a \"failure\" of the BLS to do its job.",
      "\"It's not a failure and it's not bias. It's not like the commissioner said, 'Oh, I think I'm going to change that numbers.' The commissioner has no power, no ability to do that.\"",
      "Evermore concurred. \"Having worked with BLS for years, it's impossible to cook the books as things stand,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "On Tuesday, California congressman Rep. George Whitesides, a Democrat, introduced a bill that his office said would prevent the president from \"unjustly firing the head of a statistical agency for politically-motivated reasons.\"",
      "Called the Statistical Agency Integrity and Independence Act, it asserts that a President may only dismiss the head of a federal statistical agency for cause, including demonstrated inefficiency.",
      "\"Now more than ever, as our economy reels from the impacts of haphazard tariffs and instability, we need data we can trust,\" Whitesides said in a statement Tuesday. He added that Mr. Trump's decision to fire McEntarfer \"sets a dangerous precedent.\"",
      "Data collection",
      "For years, it's become increasingly difficult to collect complete data based on surveys fielded to hundreds of thousands of employers and individuals, according to Groshen.",
      "\"There is a very long-term term trend of a declining response rate, which is bedeviling the system,\" she said. That's in part because some surveys are fielded over the phone, and American households are increasingly ditching landlines.",
      "Jeff Strohl, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, a research policy institute, echoes others in noting that BLS releases monthly jobs numbers knowing that they'll be revised. But the agency prioritizes timeliness over 100% accuracy because \"the currency of the data is still important,\" he said.",
      "Low response rates \u2014 only about 70% of employers surveyed respond on time \u2014 make revisions inevitable. according to Strohl. \"A month later, the response rate goes up to 90%-95%, so you have 25%, or 150,000, more firms reporting their data,\" he said.",
      "Additionally, weekly shocks to the economy, such as created by tariffs, adds another layer to the challenge of releasing accurate jobs data each month.",
      "\"The U.S. economy is going through a huge number of shocks on a weekly basis,\" Strohl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Tariffs are being threatened and applied, and there is a level of economic uncertainty affecting the job market.\"",
      "For example, he said, some job seekers are having offers rescinded as major universities lose research grants. \"That's stopping hires from working on projects the money was going to feed,\" he said.",

      "New research shows a growing divide in progress in the workforce between women who have earned at least a bachelor's degree and those without any higher education.",
      "The share of college-educated women in the workforce increased by nine percentage points between 2004 and 2024, research from Third Way, a think tank advocating for moderate policy, shows. Meanwhile, women without a college degree barely notched gains: The share of noncollege women in the workforce increased by less than a percentage point over the same period, according to the report.",
      "\"This divergence in the labor force experience of women with and without college degrees speaks to changes in recent years in the workplace, and around the culture of work,\" Curran McSwigan, Third Way's deputy director of economics and author of the report told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those changes are weighted toward women with degrees.\"",
      "Flex work",
      "For example, flexible work arrangements are now more common across corporations, allowing some workers to do their jobs from home, at least part of the time, and better balance work with caregiving duties.",
      "\"Remote work has inherently baked in a lot more flexibility, so working mothers may be able to pop out to take their kids to doctors appointments, instead of taking time off,\" McSwigan said.",
      "White-collar firms have also improved benefits related to caregiving, with some even offering workers child care subsidies, allowing mothers to stay in the labor force, according to McSwigan. But women without a college degree are more likely to work in service-sector jobs that aren't as well paid and don't offer the same child care benefits.",
      "\"White collar workplaces are more likely to provide workers with access to paid leave policies, even child care subsidies, and those are not traditionally the same types of benefits you see in more service-sector work that noncollege women are in,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Women in the service-sector may also work variable shifts, and require child care at hours during which day care centers don't typically operate.",
      "\"A lot of day care centers are only open 9 to 5, so they are coming up to other barriers as well, that are inherent to the types of jobs they are working,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Mothers without college sidelined",
      "Working mothers with college degrees notched even greater gains in the work place over the past two decades, with their participation rising by 11 percentage points, from 57% to 68%, according to the report. By contrast, the percentage of noncollege-educated mothers working full-time increased just 0.1% in the last 20 years.",
      "\"We have heard from policymakers that there has been strong labor force bounce back for women and that we are overcoming the 'she-cession' and making progress when it comes to women in workplace,\" McSwigan said. \"But what the data and analysis is showing is these gains can be attributed to college women, and noncollege women are still on workforce sidelines, and it's hard to say we are making progress for working women if only those with college degrees are benefitting.\"",
      "For this reason, McSwigan emphasizes the need for broad-based policy efforts that support \"the different needs that families are facing\" to ensure that all working women receive the same benefits that college-degree holders have.",
      "\"It's not one-size-fits-all approach,\" McSwigan said.",

      "The U.S. job market, already showing the strain from global trade tensions, is showing early signs of another critical issue facing workers today: artificial intelligence.",
      "For the first seven months of 2025, rising adoption of generative AI technology by private employers accounted for more than 10,000 job cuts, according to a report released this week by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market.

      "What was surprising about the Friday report was that employers not only hired fewer people than expected last month, but the government revised its jobs data sharply downward for the prior two months. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June, reflecting \"paltry\" employment growth during those months, according to a research note from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco.",
      "The latest jobs data is shedding new light on the U.S. economy as businesses absorb a multitude of changes \u2014 from President Trump's trade deals and fresh tariffs to the new GOP tax law, which provides tax breaks\u00a0to many Americans but also cuts spending on health care and social programs like food stamps. The jobs data backs up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's most recent \"beige book\"\u00a0\u2014 a report that compiles comments from local businesses \u2014 that many companies are delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant jobs report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"We know the economy has ups and downs, and we're in a pretty stagnant place right now.\"",
      "In other words, while the labor market isn't seeing massive layoffs, companies also aren't expanding their hiring plans. That can make it difficult for unemployed workers to find new jobs, with the number of people searching for work for more than 27 weeks jumping 11% to 1.8 million last month compared with a year earlier, government data shows.",
      "Pockets of strength",
      "To be sure, there were pockets of strength in the jobs report, with health care and social assistance adding a combined 73,300 jobs last month, the BLS reported. But many major U.S. employment sectors saw little or no hiring, including leisure and hospitality, transportation and construction, while others \u2014 including manufacturing \u2014 saw job losses last month, the July data shows.",
      "President Trump on Friday claimed without evidence that the jobs report was manipulated for \"political purposes,\" and fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.",
      "He also asserted that the downward revisions were \"a major mistake,\" although the BLS revises its data each month to reflect new information, and the numbers frequently move both up and down.",
      "\"The president's belief that the BLS commissioner personally 'produced' the jobs numbers is preposterous and shows a complete misunderstanding of how government statistical agencies operate,\" noted Heidi Shierholz, the president of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute and a former chief economist at the Department of Labor, in a post about McEntarfer's firing.",
      "She added, \"These data are the product of careful work by hundreds of expert economists, statisticians and civil servants following transparent, well-established methodologies.\"",
      "Tariff uncertainty",
      "Businesses have been expressing hesitation given the uncertain impact\u00a0of the Trump's tariffs, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Beth Hammack told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"I'm hearing that uncertainty has really been weighing on businesses,\" Hammack said of her discussions with business owners in her district, which spans Eastern Kentucky, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania and part of West Virginia.\u00a0 \"They've been having a tough time to decide when to invest, how much to invest. Many of them have scaled back plans for investment.\"",
      "For instance, one franchise owner said that they planned to refurbish their existing locations, rather than open new locations, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs would revive U.S. manufacturing because companies will reshore or open new factories domestically, rather than pay the import duties.",
      "Some Trump officials portrayed the jobs report as a temporary setback as the administration seeks to revive American jobs through its trade policies.",
      "\"Obviously there were elements of [the jobs report] that we didn't love, but the trade deals are now in place that cover \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 almost 60% of the global economy,\" Stephen Miran, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, told reporters Friday.",
      "With the setting of new tariff rates on Thursday for dozens of nations, uncertainty has also been resolved, he added. \"There probably were a lot of firms that, you know, sort of sitting there in May and June saying, 'Hey, you know, this tariff stuff's about to be resolved, this bill you know hopefully becomes law within a month or two \u2014 maybe I'm just going to hold off on this investment program.'\"",
      "Also on Friday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement describing a flourishing economy under President Trump. \"Inflation has cooled, wages have increased, unemployment is stable, and the private sector is growing. President Trump's America First agenda has ensured new jobs go to American citizens, instead of illegals or foreign-born workers. The tariffs are raking in billions of dollars to make our country wealthy again,\" the statement read in part.",
      "A decline in manufacturing jobs",
      "The U.S. lost 11,000 manufacturing jobs in July, and the revisions for May and June also show that the sector shed workers during those months. That's notable given Mr. Trump's promise to revive manufacturing jobs, which has led to new agreements from the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Apple to build new plants in the U.S.",
      "But the Trump administration's tariffs have added to the challenges facing the manufacturing sector, especially those producing durable goods such as appliances and automobiles, noted Indeed's Ullrich. For instance, tariffs on imported metals such as steel and aluminum are making it pricier for many manufacturers to create their products, putting pressure on their margins and profits.",
      "The downturn in manufacturing jobs \"is hardly surprising,\" said Scott Paul, president of the trade group the Alliance for American Manufacturing, in an email. \"It's another 'treading water' number, which has been the case more often than not for the past few years. But it is concerning that we're now 173,000 jobs below the most recent peak in February 2023,\" when total nonfarm payroll employment rose to 155.4 million.",
      "It's possible that manufacturing jobs could reverse the trend now that the Trump administration's tariffs and tax policies are settled, Paul added.",
      "Progress on the Trump administration's goal of reshoring American manufacturing jobs may take years, given the cost and time required to build new factories, Ullrich noted. \"There are certain products that, even with the tariffs, are still cheaper to make overseas,\" she added.",
      "\"This is not a healthy job market,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"The economy needs certainty soon on tariffs. The longer this tariff whiplash lasts, the more likely this weak hiring environment turns into layoffs.\"",

Additionally, the Trump administration instituted numerous pauses on threatened levies, delaying cost increases for businesses and consumers.",

      "That's a danger also highlighted by Hammack, who said she believes inflation could reach a 3% annual rate this year, representing a pace that would be 1 percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of a 2% annualized rate.",
      "\"Individual businesses have been trying to hold back on, passing on those [tariff] costs, because they're worried about what it might mean for demand,\" Hammack told O'Grady. \"They've been selling inventory that they'd accumulated early in the year, and so they didn't need to charge for the tariffs on that, but they're coming through those stockpiles.\"",
      "She added, \"They're coming to the point where their margins are getting squeezed and they need to start passing that onto consumers.\"",
      "Many households are still struggling with the cost of living, with half of Americans saying they view grocery prices as a major source of stress in their life right now, outpacing housing cost and health care, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\"Two-speed economy\"",
      "Hammack said the U.S. appears to be in a \"two-speed economy.\"",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" she noted. \"They're feeling a lot of excitement about the stock market, how their 401(k)s are doing, and they're feeling flush with cash.\"",
      "But, she added, low-income households are facing a lot of economic challenges.",
      "\"I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef,\" Hammack said. \"They're buying hot dogs, they're looking at their $400 emergency fund, and it's not able to pay for a new air conditioner or the car repairs that it used to be able to pay for.\"",
      "Price pressures from the Trump administration's tariffs could cause a one-time increase in costs as businesses adjust their prices to cover the import duties, she added. Fed officials are focused on making sure that the price hikes don't become what she calls a \"more persistent inflationary problem.\"",
      "\"What I'm focused on is making sure that we have an economy that's working for all Americans,\" Hammack said. \"Which is why I believe we need to stay really focused on the inflation side of our mandate.\"",
      "At the same time, Friday's disappointing jobs report shows that the labor market is also facing fresh challenges, with employers hiring fewer workers than expected in July. The Fed's mandate is to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with the central bank turning to interest rate hikes to cool inflation or rate cuts to help the job market.",
      "With both inflation on the rise and the job market experiencing some headwinds, the Fed has a delicate balancing act, she noted.",
      "\"This is a really challenging time for monetary policy makers, because both sides of our mandate are being challenged,\" Hammack said. \"And so the decision of which way to go and how quickly to move is a really difficult one right now.",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next decision on interest rates in September, and some analysts are already calling for a rate cut with the US economy seeing three straight months of weak jobs growth. Hammack admits waiting too long to cut rates because of potential inflation is a risk.",
      "\"If we wait too long to cut rates, that could mean that more people are losing their jobs than we'd like to see,\" Hammack said. \"We have to balance those two factors when we're trying to decide what's right to steer the economy forward.",

      "\"We believe this grant will now keep Musk as CEO of Tesla at least until 2030 and removes an overhang on the stock,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note.

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "More than a dozen states are seeking their own versions of Medicaid work requirements. But the incoming new federal standards pose new questions.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump signed a law adding work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, he may have undercut lawmakers in at least 14 states who were designing their own plans, according to health industry observers.",
      "Georgia is the only state with a work requirement in place for Medicaid, but several states have been pursuing such a policy for years, only to be blocked by courts or, most recently, the Biden administration. Some seek state-specific touches to the new rules. Others aim to implement work requirements before the federal law takes effect at the end of 2026.",
      "These states' moves and Mr. Trump's massive tax-and-spending law share one demand: To keep their Medicaid health coverage, adults who can work must prove they're logging a minimum number of hours at a job or school, or else qualify for one of the few exemptions.",
      "But now, states that jumped ahead need to ensure their proposals, which require federal approval, don't stray too far from Mr. Trump's law.",
      "\"The statute sets both the floor and ceiling\" for work requirements, said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor with George Washington University.",
      "South Dakota, for example, announced in July that it would not submit an application for work requirements as previously planned amid concerns that the state's laxer rules would not be allowed under the new federal law. The state's Department of Social Services secretary had warned that working on a state proposal while the federal rules are being hashed out could be \"an exercise in futility.\"",
      "Arkansas' plan, on the other hand, is more stringent than the federal law. There are no exemptions to its work requirements in the application, which is pending with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "Arizona's proposal also includes something that's not in the federal law: a ban on \"able-bodied adults\" receiving Medicaid benefits for longer than five years total in their lives.",
      "Arkansas and Arizona government officials said they were working with federal officials to square their plans with the new standards.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the department is analyzing how the new federal standards interact with state waivers.",
      "The federal health department must release rules by next June that outline how states are to implement work requirements, according to Elizabeth Hinton, who has been tracking such waivers as part of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "\"We don't exactly know what that will cover,\" Hinton said.",
      "It's unclear how federal officials will respond to the states' requests, she added, but \"we are aware that some folks think there is no wiggle room here.\"",
      "States can tweak their Medicaid programs through what are known as demonstration waivers, which are subject to federal approval. The waivers are designed to test new ideas in policy gray areas.",
      "The states that have filed or plan to file such applications with work requirements include Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.",
      "Congressional Republicans who passed the budget reconciliation bill left room for states to use waivers to fast-track the national standards. Tara Sklar, a professor leading the University of Arizona's Health Law & Policy Program, said she expects states seeking certain stricter requirements to have a chance of approval, while more lenient ones may face denials.",
      "Federal officials may look favorably on Arizona's plan, Sklar said, as a five-year lifetime Medicaid limit is different from work requirements. Even if the federal government greenlights stricter work requirements than the federal law calls for, those programs are likely to face legal challenges, she added.",
      "The federal law includes an 80-hour-per-month minimum for work or education, with exemptions for certain adults, including people who are medically frail and parents with young, dependent children.",
      "Montana is the first state to draft a waiver application since Congress finalized national work requirements. State lawmakers first approved work requirements \u2014 called \"community engagement\" standards under the state plan \u2014 in 2019, but the state's application stalled through the end of the first Trump term and the Biden administration.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected again, Montana lawmakers lifted the 2025 expiration date of its Medicaid expansion program, making permanent the program that covered more than 76,000 adults in April, with the expectation that the Trump administration would approve work requirements. In mid-July, state officials released their draft plan to make that a reality \"as soon as is practicable.\"",
      "The Montana plan largely aligns with the federal law, but it would create additional exemptions, including for people who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence.",
      "Republican state Sen. Gayle Lammers said work requirements that also protect such people who need Medicaid were a big part of persuading legislators to keep the expansion program. At the time, officials didn't know where the federal government would land on work requirements. And now, Lammers said, it makes sense for Montana to stick to its plan.",
      "\"The state should have a say,\" Lammers said. \"We're very independent, and everyone is different.\"",
      "In South Carolina, state officials are seeking to roll out work requirements for a limited number of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. South Carolina is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and yet the state submitted a request with the federal government in June for a partial Medicaid expansion that includes a work requirement component that largely reflects the new federal standards.",
      "In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, called South Carolina's proposal \"a state-specific solution.\"",
      "The only state with an active work requirement program now wants to scale it back and awaits federal approval to do so. \"Georgia Pathways to Coverage\" expires at the end of September unless CMS greenlights an extension of the program with a key change: requiring enrollees to document once a year that they're working, not monthly. That's a pivot away from the program's initial design but also differs from the new federal rules, which call for checks every six months.",
      "Fiona Roberts, a spokesperson for Georgia's Medicaid agency, said the state is still waiting to hear whether it needs to alter its plan.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman ruled that President Trump's administration cannot withhold citizenship from children born to people in the country illegally or temporarily.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Maryland ruled late Thursday that President Trump's administration cannot withhold citizenship from children born to people in the country illegally or temporarily, issuing the fourth court decision blocking the president's birthright citizenship order nationwide since a key U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June.",
      "U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman's preliminary injunction was expected after the judge said last month she would issue such an order if the case were returned to her by an appeals court. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back to her later in July.",
      "The policy, which has been the subject of a complicated monthslong legal back-and-forth, is currently on hold. Since June, two other district courts, as well as an appellate panel of judges, have also blocked the birthright order nationwide.",
      "On the first day of Mr. Trump's second term, he signed\u00a0an executive order\u00a0that said people born in the United States should not automatically get citizenship if one parent is undocumented and the other isn't a citizen or green-card holder, or if both parents are in the U.S. on temporary visas. The order directed federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents within 30 days to people who fall into those categories.",
      "The order drew a flurry of lawsuits, as most legal experts have said the 14th Amendment \u2014 which was ratified in 1868 \u2014 automatically offers citizenship to virtually everybody born within the U.S., regardless of their parents' immigration status, with extremely narrow exceptions.",
      "The Trump administration argues the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment does not apply to people whose parents are in the country illegally or temporarily \u2014 citing a clause that says citizenship is granted to those who are \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. Those parents do not necessarily have \"allegiance\" to the country, the government\u00a0argues, so they therefore aren't \"subject to the jurisdiction.\"",
      "Boardman, in February, issued a preliminary injunction blocking the order nationwide. But the June ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court upended that decision and other court rulings blocking the order across the nation.",
      "The high court's\u00a0ruling in June\u00a0limited the use of nationwide injunctions. In a 6-3 decision, it granted a request by the administration to narrow the injunctions against the birthright citizenship order, but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief.\"",
      "That doesn't mean the birthright citizenship order will take effect. Shortly after the ruling, a New Hampshire court\u00a0paused the executive order\u00a0nationwide in a lawsuit that was brought as a class action, after the Supreme Court's decision left the door open to that option.",
      "The Supreme Court also did not directly address whether states can still sue over the order. In the case that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled on in July, the government\u00a0has argued\u00a0that courts can just block the birthright citizenship order for residents of the states that sued, rather than issuing a nationwide injunction. But the states\u00a0argue\u00a0that would provide them with incomplete relief because people move from state to state.",
      "In her ruling Thursday, Boardman certified a class of all children who have been born or will be born in the United States after Feb. 19, 2025, who would be affected by Trump's order.",
      "She said the plaintiffs in the lawsuit before her were \"extremely likely\" to win their argument that the birthright order violates the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which includes a citizenship clause that says all people born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to U.S. jurisdiction, are citizens. They were also likely to suffer irreparable harm if the order went into effect, she wrote.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 20:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Census Bureau said it began planning the 2030 census in 2019.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday said he had instructed the Department of Commerce to \"immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate\" census that would exclude undocumented immigrants.",
      "But the census is a massive undertaking and has huge repercussions nationally, including on congressional seat alignment \u2014 so it's not something that can be changed quickly. In fact, the Census Bureau\u00a0said\u00a0it began planning the 2030 census in 2019.",
      "Asked for comment on Mr. Trump's post, a Commerce Department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement: \"The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data. We will accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the census process:",
      "The Constitution requires the Census be taken every 10 years",
      "Per Article I, Section 2: \"The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct.\" Congress codified the decennial census into law in 1954. The Constitution also mandates that reapportionment (the designation of how many Congressional seats a state gets) happens every 10 years, in line with the Census. Redistricting then uses that apportionment and then states are supposed to redraw lines every 10 years, when they know how many Congressional seats they will have for the decade.",
      "The actual data collection for the 2030 Census is supposed to start in ... 2030",
      "It's a long process to design the Census process, send out the Census forms and then have enumerators physically go out to collect the rest of the data for people who don't mail their form back or fill it out online. The Bureau says they started planning for the 2030 Census in\u00a02019. But the actual surveys and collection of data at a large scale begins on Census Day, April 1 of each decade year. Currently, the\u00a0bureau's timeline\u00a0has them in the \"Development and Integration Phase\" which includes more design planning, and small-scale field tests.",
      "Citizenship question in the Census?",
      "In Mr. Trump's first term, his administration tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but that was\u00a0rejected in a 5-4 decision by the Supreme Court. But that decision kept the door open to including that question in the future, but concluded that the reason given by the administration and then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was \"contrived\" and \"pretextual.\" Because of a tight timeline for when Census forms had to be finalized in 2019, the Trump administration didn't have time to appeal and find another avenue to get the citizenship question on the Census. With Census collection for 2030 still years away, there's a longer runway to legally try and get a citizenship question on the form.",
      "The Census Bureau does take annual surveys/data gathering, but not for population count that would impact redistricting",
      "Since 2005, the Bureau conducts the \"American Community Survey\" every year to collect social, economic, housing and demographic information from a\u00a0sample\u00a0of households in all 50 states.\u00a0This\u00a0survey does ask about place of birth, citizenship and year of entry into the U.S. But the Bureau maintains that the data remains anonymous.",
      "\"No one is able to figure out your survey answers from the statistics we produce,\" the Census website\u00a0states.",
      "Is political party collected in the Census?",
      "No. There is a monthly survey sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the Census Bureau conducts that does measure this in election years and then after an election. But the decennial Census does not ask about political party, income or religion.",
      "Black, Latino and Indigenous populations were undercounted in the 2020 census",
      "The Bureau and experts cited delays caused by COVID-19 and a chilling effect by Mr. Trump's attempt to introduce a citizenship question on the Census form, as the reason for the undercount. Latinos saw about a 5% undercount in 2020, compared to 1.54% in the 2010 Census. The undercount rate for the Black population was 3.3% in 2020, compared to 2% in 2010. Overall, the Census Bureau's post-enumeration survey found that there was a net coverage undercount of 0.25% or 782,000 for the nation.",
      "How do Congressional seats work with the Census?",
      "In 1911, Congress set the number of seats at 435, a number which was permanently set by the 1929 Permanent Apportionment Act. The number of seats each state gets is determined by population, with a minimum of one. California has the most with 52, followed by Texas with 38 and Florida with 28.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to increase federal law enforcement in Washington, D.C., as early as Friday morning following the alleged assault of former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine over the weekend; the incident prompted outrage from the president himself.",
      "After the alleged attack on the ex-DOGE staffer, President Trump on Wednesday said in a Truth Social post that he might put the District of Columbia under federal control if the city doesn't \"get its act together, and quickly.\"",
      "\"If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City,\" he wrote.",
      "Three sources briefed on the D.C. deployment said the additional officers will come from the D.C. National Guard, FBI, U.S. Marshals, ICE, U.S. Secret Service and additional components of the Department of Homeland Security. One source added that officials from the relevant law enforcement agencies met Thursday to review plans for deployment.",
      "A White House official later confirmed to CBS News that the increased federal law enforcement presence on D.C. streets would begin at midnight Thursday and would focus on tourist areas and other known hotspots. Along with the FBI and U.S. Marshals Service, the official said the operation would involve multiple federal agencies \u2014 including U.S. Capitol Police, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, among others.",
      "The official disclosed the increased police presence would be part of a seven-day operation that could be extended as needed. The federal officers on patrol would be highly visible in marked units, the official said.",
      "\"Washington, DC is an amazing city, but it has been plagued by violent crime for far too long,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Thursday night. \"President Trump has directed an increased presence of federal law enforcement to protect innocent citizens. Starting tonight, there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C. President Trump is committed to making our Nation's capital safer for its residents, lawmakers, and visitors from all around the world.\"",
      "Overnight Wednesday, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was notified of an increased federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital, and she approved the request by the White House to put additional officers on the streets, according to an official in the mayor's office.",
      "But otherwise, there's been little to no coordination between the Metropolitan Police Department and federal law enforcement, a D.C. police source said. The agency has not been notified about what the increase in law enforcement might look like across the nation's capital, according to the source. The department has been hamstrung by Congress since House Republicans refused in June to consider a measure to restore hundreds of millions of dollars of its funding. There's currently a hiring freeze for D.C. Police professional staff and restrictions on overtime for officers.",
      "Asked by CBS News about the plans to increase federal law enforcement D.C., the District's U.S. Attorney, Jeanine Pirro, expressed uncertainty about any impending changes but said, \"My understanding is that both the Trump administration and the Metropolitan Police Department are looking to increase law enforcement efforts because of the violence we're seeing across this \u2026 city.\"",
      "Pressed further by a reporter, she added that it was \"a decision for the president.\"",
      "\"Young people are being coddled,\" Pirro said. \"They need to be held accountable. They shouldn't be going to arts and crafts in D.C. family court.\" Pirro also made reference to a 19-year-old who had used an illegal gun to fire shots on a Metrobus and was subsequently charged and sentenced to parole.",
      "\"All I want to do is clean up D.C. That's why the president put me here,\" Pirro said. \"And youth crime is on the rise.\"",
      "Pirro also mentioned that four years ago, her office had handled 150,000 cases of youth violence. \"We now have nearly half a million,\" she said.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that the increase in federal law enforcement in D.C. is in compliance with President Trump's \"Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful\" executive order signed on March 28, and is part of fulfilling his campaign promise to make America safe again.",
      "That executive order said federal law enforcement officers could be deployed in D.C., in areas around the National Mall and Memorial Parks, museums, monuments, Lafayette Park, Union Station, Rock Creek Park, Anacostia Park, the George Washington Memorial Parkway, the Suitland Parkway, and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.",
      "Federal law enforcement and National Park Services have, according to the order, already been used to arrest undocumented immigrants, and remove homelessness encampments in the District.",
      "What do D.C. crime statistics say?",
      "In 2023, there was a sharp increase in crime in the nation's capital, making D.C. one of America's deadliest cities. In response, Congress even blocked revisions to Washington, D.C.'s criminal code for the first time in 31 years, in March 2023.",
      "But violent crime in D.C. has tapered off, decreasing since the start of 2024; it's part of a larger nationwide drop in murder rates that has hit its lowest level in decades. D.C Police data show assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 19% year-to-date compared with 2024, while robberies have fallen by 39 percent, compared to last year. In 2025, there have also been 14 fewer homicides to date \u2013 a drop of 12%, compared to the same period last year.",
      "Still, 98 people have been killed citywide so far this year \u2014 including a congressional intern, killed by a stray bullet on a downtown street, and two Israeli embassy staffers gunned down in May. The alleged assault on Coristine was just last week.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the U.S. Park Police, U.S. Secret Service, ICE, CBP, FBI Washington Field Office, Federal Protective Services and DC National Guard for comment.",

The network joined CBS News and other news organizations in suing to obtain thousands of hours of surveillance footage and court exhibits from the more than 1,000 criminal cases brought by the Justice Department against people who allegedly participated in the Capitol attack.",
      "Among those defendants was Jared Wise, who eventually faced six charges as a result of his alleged actions on Jan. 6. He pleaded not guilty. Wise's hiring by the Justice Department was reported last month. A Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement that Wise \"is a valued member of The Department of Justice and we appreciate his contributions to our team.\"",
      "Wise was employed as a special agent and supervisory special agent with the FBI from 2004 through 2017, according to the Justice Department.",
      "He was indicted in May 2023 on six counts that arose out of his alleged actions on Jan. 6, when a violent mob of President Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol building to protest the 2020 election results. Among the charges was one count of civil disorder and one count of assaulting, resisting or impeding an officer of the U.S. performing their official duties.",
      "In accompanying court papers, an FBI agent said that video footage depicted Wise inside the Capitol building on the afternoon of Jan. 6 after entering from a Senate door. Body camera footage from the Metropolitan Police Department also showed Wise engaging with police officers outside the Capitol, telling them, \"You guys are disgusting. I'm former \u2014 I'm former law enforcement. You're disgusting. You are the Nazi. You are the Gestapo. You can't see it because you're chasing a pension, right? Your pension. Your retirement right?\"",
      "The footage shows him continuing to yell at the officers, telling them, \"Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you!\"",
      "When police who were attempting to move protesters back from the Capitol were knocked to the ground in front of Wise, the video shows him shouting toward them \"Yeah, f*** them! Yeah, kill 'em!\" He also allegedly yelled toward rioters attacking a police line, \"Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Kill 'em!\"",
      "Wise had lived in New Braunfels, Texas, until June 2022, after which he moved to Bend, Oregon, according to court records. An unidentified tipster told the FBI in January 2022 that Wise shared he was inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, the agent said. The FBI then obtained a court-authorized search warrant for Wise's records, which confirmed he was around the Capitol that day, according to the filing.",
      "Wise pleaded not guilty to the charges in June 2023. A trial was set to begin last fall and was ultimately held in January. But before the jury could begin deliberating, Mr. Trump issued blanket pardons to roughly 1,500 defendants charged for their alleged role in the Jan. 6 attack.",

But it isn't the only state where redistricting pushes are underway, as California and other states consider similar moves ahead of the midterms.",
      "Typically, states redraw congressional and legislative districts after the decennial census to reflect population shifts. Texas undertook its redistricting effort after President Trump suggested in mid-July the state should redraw for Republican advantage. About a week earlier, the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights division, Harmeet Dhillon, had written to the Texas governor and state attorney general to complain that four of the state's current districts were \"coalition districts\" \u2014 that is, districts with different racial groups that support the same candidate \u2014 that were \"not protected by the Voting Rights Act.\"",

But in at least two of those states, New York and California, Democratic governors are looking for ways to get around that requirement in order to bolster their congressional delegations' majorities.",
      "In other states, congressional delegations already heavily skew toward one party, limiting the number of gains that can be made. Maryland's eight-member delegation has just one Republican, and in Illinois, Democrats control 14 of the 17 House seats.",
      "Looming over the redistricting efforts is a case before the Supreme Court that could have significant implications for the Voting Rights Act and attempts to remedy alleged vote dilution. The dispute involves Louisiana's congressional map, and while the high court heard arguments in March, it set the case for re-argument in its next term, which starts in October.",

Louisiana's map now includes two majority-Black districts out of its six House seats.",

      "Several White House officials were also in attendance at the meeting, including Deputy Chief of Staff James Blair, Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Director Alex Meyer and White House counsel Dave Warrington.",
      "A White House official told CBS News they believe the meeting \"moved the needle\" on getting the Indiana Republican legislators on board with a redistricting effort in the Hoosier State and could potentially result in a GOP takeover of all nine congressional seats.",
      "Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan's seat in the northwest corner of the state, bordering parts of Chicago's suburbs, could be a target as Republicans consider an effort to redraw the state's congressional maps. The Indiana Legislature, overwhelmingly controlled by Republicans, is tasked with drawing its congressional districts.",
      "New York",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie have suggested that the Democratic-controlled legislature could create new congressional maps that are more friendly to Democrats.",
      "\"We're sick and tired of being pushed around when other states don't have the same aspirations that we always have had, and I hold those dear, but I cannot ignore that,\" Hochul said at a press conference with some Texas Democratic lawmakers earlier this week. \"This the playing field has changed dramatically, and shame on us if we ignore that fact and cling tight to the vestiges of the past. That era is over. Donald Trump eliminated that. Forever.\"",
      "But New York faces some steep obstacles in trying to redraw the maps before the midterms. New York's constitution calls for a bipartisan commission to draw up the congressional maps, although the state Assembly and Senate get final approval. In the 2021 redistricting, New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, said Democrats had \"unconstitutionally gerrymandered districts\" and ordered a special master to redraw the district.",
      "With the help of these maps, Republicans were able to flip four seats in New York in the 2022 elections, making the congressional delegation 15 Democrats and 11 Republicans. Democrats sued, and in a 4-3 decision, the Court of Appeals said those maps were supposed to be temporary and ordered an independent commission to redraw the maps. The new districts gave Democrats a slight edge. With these maps, Democrats flipped four seats in 2024, giving them 19 seats in the state and Republicans seven.",
      "If Democrats wanted to lead an effort to change New York's constitution, it would require an affirmative vote in two consecutive sessions of the Legislature, and then it would have to be approved by voters, as Hochul herself noted on Monday. The 2025 legislative session is already over, with the next session starting in January 2026.",
      "\"This could be really more on the ballot in the fall of '27 and be enacted in time for the congressional races in 2028 as well as the presidential \u2014 so, it is not the timeline that I would have preferred, but it does shave off four years from another through the process,\" Hochul said Monday. \"But we're going to also look at litigation strategies. We're in close conversations about options there, and so I would say we're presenting all options right now.\"",
      "The state constitution also prohibits mid-decade redistricting, and any new proposal to amend it to allow a redrawing of state lines before the next census would have to clear the current state legislature and the one elected in 2026.",
      "\"The earliest that could go into effect would be after the 2027 elections, preventing the state from re-redistricting until the 2028 election cycle,\" said Jeffrey Wice, a redistricting expert and professor at New York Law School.",
      "Following Hochul's suggestion that the state's redistricting commission be disbanded, Wice said it's not a surprise that some are calling for it to be scrapped after the panel failed to complete its work in 2022 \u2014 until a court stepped in.",
      "\"A state legislature can draw a responsibly developed map if it follows objective and prioritized criteria and works in an open and transparent manner, inviting public participation and review,\" he said.",
      "Missouri",
      "Republicans have a trifecta in Missouri, and the Legislature is tasked with drawing its congressional districts. State lawmakers approved a congressional redistricting plan in 2022, after which Republicans won six of Missouri's eight congressional seats.",
      "But some state lawmakers want to extend the GOP's hold on the congressional map to 7-1. State party leaders may target the 5th Congressional District, currently represented by Democratic Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. Although Cleaver won by over 23 points in 2024, Republicans in neighboring districts each won by more than 40 points.",
      "The only time Missouri has engaged in mid-decade redistricting was in the 1960s, when the Supreme Court ruled each district had to be nearly equal in population, and a new Senatorial Appointment Commission was established to redraw the Congressional districts for the 1966 election.",
      "State Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O'Laughlin told Columbia's KSSZ 93.9 last week that it is \"likely\" the Legislature would be called in for a special session by Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican. He told St. Louis' Fox affiliate over the weekend that he supported the idea, saying \"is Missouri represented properly in Washington, D.C., and, quite frankly, what can we do to support President Trump's agenda?\"",
      "Lt. Gov. David Wasinger also indicated support for redrawing the congressional map, noting in a statement that Missouri is a \"solidly conservative state.\"",
      "\"Despite this, our current congressional map still sends two progressive Democrats to push a liberal agenda in D.C., misrepresenting the will of Missouri voters,\" he said in a statement. \"We missed the chance to secure a 7-1 map in 2022, a mistake President Trump rightly calls on us to fix. Missouri's next congressional map must protect Missouri values and ensure our representatives in Congress are as conservative as the voters who send them.\"",
      "The Missouri Freedom Caucus, a coalition of conservative state lawmakers, has also been urging Kehoe, a Republican, to convene a special session of the state General Assembly to redraw its congressional map \"consistent with President Trump's recommendation.\"",
      "\"The most current congressional map that was passed was a weak compromise \u2014 inconsistent with the political will of Missouri voters,\" the Missouri Freedom Caucus said in a statement last week. \"It's time this super-majority Republican party in Missouri grows a spine and actually delivers the congressional map that reflects the strong conservative values of this great state, as the political makeup of this state clearly demands.\"",
      "Florida",
      "In Florida, the congressional maps are created by the Legislature and approved by the governor.",
      "Florida Republicans have 20 seats in the U.S. House, with Democrats holding just eight. Although Democrats had challenged the current maps in court, the Florida Supreme Court in July upheld the elimination of a majority Black district.",
      "Despite that victory, Gov. Ron DeSantis said in July that he was \"seriously\" looking at asking the GOP-controlled Legislature to redraw the maps.",
      "DeSantis has also criticizedlong insisted that he felt the 2020 Census was flawed and Florida should have gained two Congressional seats, rather than one.",
      "\"I do think we are going to be looking at the pathways to be able do the redistricting here in Florida,\" DeSantis said on July 30.",
      "On Thursday, Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez sent a memo to lawmakers announcing a select committee on redistricting, according to the Tampa Bay Times.",

A\u00a0ceasefire in September 2023 averted a wider war, and the countries concluded talks over a peace treaty in March. But talks aimed at cementing the deal have\u00a0stalled in the months since, with negotiations in Abu Dhabi in July failing to lead to a breakthrough.",
      "Special envoy Steve Witkoff traveled to Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, in March. Aryeh Lightstone, former CEO of the Abraham Accords Peace Institute, has made multiple trips to the region as part of peace deal talks. The Trump administration has said an Azerbaijan peace deal with its neighbor is necessary before it can join the Abraham Accords, as part of a plan to expand that agreement beyond the Arab countries that signed up to it in 2020 when they recognized Israel.",
      "Entry into the accords isn't expected on Friday, sources said. Both Witkoff and Lightstone are expected to be at Friday's summit.",

The president has pressured Powell to cut short-term interest rates under the belief that his tariffs will not fuel higher inflationary pressures.",
      "\"What we're seeing now in real time is a repetition once again of this pattern where the president will end up having been proven right,\" Miran said on MSNBC. \"And the Fed will, with a lag and probably quite too late, eventually catch up to the president's view.\""

      "FBI Director Kash Patel has agreed to aid the search for the Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to protest new congressional maps, Sen. John Cornyn said Thursday.",
      "Texas Republicans have been trying to bring the Democrats back so there are enough lawmakers on the floor for a quorum, which would enable them to vote on new congressional maps likely to increase the GOP advantage in the state. Texas requires two-thirds of the House \u2014 or 100 of the 150 representatives \u2014 to be present for a quorum.",
      "It's unclear what the laws the legislators might have broken that would involve the FBI. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has called for civil arrest and said he had ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to force them to return. But Texas DPS does not have jurisdiction outside the state.",
      "Abbott and Cornyn have raised allegations of bribery, since the lawmakers' quorum break is being funded by donations from various groups, including former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke's PAC and other Democratic groups. In addition to travel expenses, each Democrat faces fines of $500 a day.",
      "\"I thank President Trump and Director Patel for supporting and swiftly acting on my call for the federal government to hold these supposed lawmakers accountable for fleeing Texas,\" Cornyn said. \"We cannot allow these rogue legislators to avoid their constitutional responsibilities.\"",
      "In response, Texas Rep. John Bucy, one of the lawmakers who left the state, called the FBI's involvement \"the kind of authoritarian overreach we condemn in other countries.\"",
      "Abbott last month called a 30-day special session with 18 agenda items, including embarking on a rare mid-decade redistricting ordered by President Trump. Texas has 38 representatives in Congress, 25 Republicans and 13 Democrats. Mr. Trump asked Texas Republicans to redraw the congressional map to deliver up to five more seats for the GOP.",
      "\"We are entitled to five more seats,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday.",
      "This is not the first time Democrats in Texas have left the state to prevent a quorum, and not even the first time they have used this tactic to protest a mid-decade redistricting.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of Democrats in Congress is seeking to stop Department of Government Efficiency employees from moving into permanent positions in the federal government, penning a letter asking for more information on DOGE's presence within agencies after Elon Musk's exit earlier this year.",
      "\"Although Elon Musk has departed, his influence remains, as DOGE and its employees attempt to become a permanent part of the federal government, scattered across agencies where they can continue to sabotage key functions from within,\" Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, along with Rep. Robert Garcia of California, wrote in a letter late Wednesday.",
      "Writing to Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, the Democratic senators and ranking member on the House Oversight Committee sought more information on how DOGE has embedded itself in the federal government.",
      "The lawmakers called DOGE's continued presence in federal agencies \"alarming,\" outlining in the letter, obtained exclusively by CBS News, that \"employees are embedding themselves in the federal government in key agency positions\" which they argue threatens the government's ability \"to serve the American people,\" while alluding to potential violations of civil service laws.",
      "Kupor refuted the lawmakers' characterization of the civil service hiring process in a statement to CBS News, saying OPM \"reviews all requests to appoint current or recent political appointees to career roles for compliance with merit systems principles and civil service laws,\" while noting that \"all federal hires undergo required background checks, ethics reviews, and suitability screenings.\"",
      "\"No DOGE-affiliated individuals have 'unlawfully burrowed' into career roles,\" Kupor said. \"We welcome oversight grounded in facts.\"",
      "The Democrats' request comes as DOGE's presence in Washington has changed shape since Musk left his role as a \"special government employee\" in late May, when he reached the maximum amount of time he could serve in the position. President Trump thanked Musk \"and all of his people\" at the time, saying, \"almost all of them are staying, and they're going to be with us. And you're going to see the results coming long into the future.\"",
      "Musk pledged upon his departure that \"this is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.\"",
      "The Tesla CEO began the cost-cutting effort in January and had initially pledged to cut $2 trillion of government spending, but later lowered the benchmark to $1 trillion. At the time of Musk's departure, the White House said DOGE's efforts saved roughly $170 billion in spending. But that figure has been disputed, with a number of errors and miscalculations on the initiative's \"wall of receipts.\"",
      "Since Musk left the role, DOGE has continued to post about its cost cutting. A recent review by CBS News found that the claims about savings appear to be significantly overstated. Still, Musk pledged when he left the job that DOGE is \"like a way of life\" and would be \"permeating throughout the government\" to secure $1 trillion in savings \"over time.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Vought outlined at a House Appropriations Committee hearing in June that the vision for DOGE going forward would be \"far more institutionalized at the actual agency,\" saying many DOGE employees are functioning \"almost as in-house consultants as a part of the agency's leadership.\" The leadership of DOGE, Vought said, is \"now much more decentralized.\"",
      "For some, questions have remained about how the effort would continue to shape government agencies. Writing to Vought and Kupor, the Democratic lawmakers sought answers to a number of questions, including who currently leads DOGE and queries about the presence of DOGE employees within the federal government more broadly.",
      "The lawmakers said that converting DOGE appointees to career federal service roles could \"potentially run afoul of laws that explicitly ban political considerations and loyalty tests in hiring practices,\" adding that \"it is unclear who newly embedded DOGE staff are accountable to and if they truly serve within the chain of command of the agencies they work for.\" They urged OPM to enforce civil service regulations \"that prohibit political patronage in government hiring.\"",

    "summary": "The renowned research hospital that cares for people with rare or life-threatening diseases has been pummeled by an employee exodus and the gutting of research, both driven by the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "The number of people receiving treatment at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center \u2014 the renowned research hospital that cares for patients with rare or life-threatening diseases \u2014 has tumbled under the second Trump administration, according to government documents and interviews with current and former NIH employees.",
      "NIH documents viewed by KFF Health News show a pronounced decline in patients at the 200-bed hospital from February through April, a time that coincides with the Department of Health and Human Services' mass firings of government employees, the gutting of scientific research, and the administration's broad crackdown on immigration. The average number of patients being treated daily during that time hovered between 60 and 80, with the April numbers falling to the lower end of that range. By contrast, in October, about 80 patients per day on average were at the hospital.",
      "The number of cancer clinical trial participants at the hospital as of July was down about 20% from last year, one NIH cancer scientist said. KFF Health News agreed not to identify the scientist and others who participated in this article who were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation.",
      "The numbers \"really don't look too good,\" Pius Aiyelawo, acting CEO of the clinical center, said during a May 23 meeting of the NIH Clinical Center Research Hospital Board.",
      "As of April 30, the average number of patients in the hospital per day had declined by 5.7% compared with the same period a year ago.",
      "Adults and children with cancer, people who need bone marrow transplants, and people with rare diseases or infections are among the patients who receive care at no charge at the NIH hospital, according to former officials. Clinicians there provide potentially lifesaving treatments as part of clinical trials, often to people who have run out of options.",
      "Research at the hospital has also led to breakthroughs about cancer, traumatic brain injury, and AIDS, among other ailments. James Gilman, a physician who was CEO of the clinical center from 2017 until retiring in January, said the center has driven important advances against disease \"that couldn't have happened anywhere else.\"",
      "Former officials said the drop in patients this year is a consequence of the upheaval the Trump administration has caused at the NIH, the world's largest public funder of scientific research.",
      "Current and former employees say an exodus of clinicians, scientists, and other staffers has limited how many patients can be treated. Morale has tanked because of widespread firings and the administration's cancellation of grants that funded research into health disparities, vaccines, the health of LGBTQ+ people, and more. Contracts have been cut, and scientists have seen delays in getting essential supplies for clinical research.",
      "\"Every day seems to be some type of breaking point,\" one NIH worker said.",
      "During the May board meeting, a video of which KFF Health News viewed, Aiyelawo attributed the decrease in patients coming to the hospital to the departure of NIH investigators \u2014 the researchers on studies \u2014 and less patient recruitment. He also noted 11 recent departures of clinical center staffers. They included Christine Grady, a nurse who led the center's bioethics department and the wife of Anthony Fauci, the former head of the NIH's infectious diseases institute who became a lightning rod for conservatives during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "HHS has fired more than 1,200 NIH employees this year as part of its purge of the federal workforce, but the true number of departures is almost certainly higher. Others have opted for early retirement or quit because they opposed the Trump administration's orders.",
      "Gilman said the NIH hospital relies on a \"very complex ecosystem and network to find patients who are not too sick\" to potentially be enrolled in a clinical trial. When researchers leave, \"those patients are lost,\" he said.",
      "The clinical center's 2025 annual report said there were roughly 1,500 research studies underway in 2024, including studies focused on cancer, infectious disease, heart and lung conditions, and blood disorders. Clinical trials accounted for about half.",
      "The National Cancer Institute \u2014 which is the largest of the NIH's 27 institutes and has been crippled by cuts and chaos this year \u2014 typically has the most patients needing inpatient care, Gilman said.",
      "\"What has happened here since January has been a pretty traumatic time for that ecosystem,\" he said, \"and there are pieces of it that will take a long time to rebuild, if indeed they get a chance to rebuild.\"",
      "During the May board meeting, Aiyelawo said NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya \"is very aware\" that fewer people are getting treated at the hospital \"and we're doing everything we can to be able to get those numbers up.\"",
      "The drop in patients this year isn't isolated to people needing inpatient care, NIH documents show. As of the end of April, outpatient visits were down 8.5% compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year. The number of new patients overall had declined by 6.7%, to about 3,370 people.",
      "In response to questions, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote in an emailed statement that the clinical center \"remains fully operational and continues to provide world-class clinical research and patient care. Every day, patients from across the country and around the globe come here to participate in cutting-edge studies that drive scientific discovery and improve health outcomes.\"",
      "\"As the crown jewel of research and discovery, the Clinical Center is a top priority\" under Bhattacharya's leadership, Nixon said. \"We are committed to fully leveraging its capabilities as the nation's hub for clinical research innovation. Our focus remains on empowering the research community and advancing the critical mission of making medical breakthroughs possible right here on the NIH campus.\"",
      "Even before President Trump began his second term, the hospital had struggled with lagging patient numbers. Before the pandemic, it averaged more than 110 patients daily. Those numbers plummeted starting in 2020, government documents show. During the 2022 fiscal year, there were about 73 patients, on average, in the hospital per day.",
      "While yearly figures have increased since then, they have not gone back to pre-pandemic levels. NIH documents show that the hospital saw an average of roughly 81 patients per day during fiscal 2024, which ended in September. Still, one NIH worker said: \"This is a manufactured crisis. COVID was not.\"",
      "The federal government has also moved to tighten rules surrounding visitors from abroad, which likely limits how many people living in the U.S. without legal status would come to the NIH for care.",
      "Before Mr. Trump, officials developed a new visitor policy for the NIH that required people who aren't U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to register online before arriving. But its implementation was delayed, Gilman said. It did not launch until late January, after President Joe Biden was no longer in office and around the time the Trump administration began its deportation operation.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has carried out widespread raids and arrests and allowed immigration authorities unprecedented access to various federal data sources \u2014 including tax information and Medicaid recipients' personal data \u2014 as part of its immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "The clinical center's most recent annual report said around 600 patients in 2024 were from abroad.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says the federal government is calling off around $500 million worth of vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology.",
    "story": [
      "The federal government is calling off around $500 million worth of vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday.",
      "The 22 now-terminated projects were funded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. Most of the projects that were canceled were for vaccines that fight COVID-19 or the flu, Kennedy\u00a0said.",
      "They include proposals from Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur and other drugmakers that were rejected or canceled, along with a now-shuttered award to Moderna to develop a bird flu vaccine, according to an HHS statement. The projects were reviewed and canceled over the last few weeks, said Kennedy.",
      "A Moderna spokesperson told CBS News that the company's H5N1 (bird flu) contract was canceled in May, and it isn't aware of any new BARDA cancellations.",
      "Kennedy framed the move as part of a step away from research into mRNA vaccines. Those types of vaccines\u00a0use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce antibody production to protect against an infection. The approach has drawn more interest since the COVID-19 pandemic, when mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna were\u00a0found to be safe and effective against the coronavirus. Public health officials credit the rapid development of the vaccines with saving millions of lives.",
      "Nevertheless, Kennedy said, \"HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses.\"",
      "He argued mRNA-based vaccines can stop working properly if the virus that they target mutates too much, citing\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0as an example. \"A single mutation can make mRNA vaccines ineffective,\" Kennedy said.",
      "On Wednesday, CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes asked President Trump for his response to Kennedy's announcement, pointing out that the president had been the driving force behind Operation Warp Speed, the public-private partnership that developed and distributed mRNA COVID vaccines in a compressed timeline of months, rather than the years it had previously taken to produce effective vaccines.",
      "\"Everything about it has been amazing,\" Mr. Trump replied, \"but you know, that was now a long time ago, and we're onto other things. But we are speaking about it \u2014 we have meetings about it tomorrow ... we're looking for other answers to other problems, to other sicknesses and diseases.\"",
      "Jerome Adams, who was surgeon general during Mr. Trump's first term,\u00a0condemned\u00a0Kennedy's announcement in a post on X.",
      "\"I've tried to be objective & non-alarmist in response to current HHS actions \u2013 but quite frankly this move is going to cost lives,\" Adams wrote. \"mRNA technology has uses that go far beyond vaccines\u2026 and the vaccine they helped develop in record time is credited with saving millions.\"",
      "He noted that researchers are developing mRNA applications in therapies and vaccines for flu, RSV, HIV, Zika, cancer and autoimmune diseases, and said the U.S. should be \"doubling down on what works - not defunding it.\"",
      "Leading infectious disease experts criticized the decision and said it will leave Americans vulnerable.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a virologist and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said Kennedy \"has once again made a decision, not based on scientific evidence that puts this country at unnecessary risk.\"",
      "Epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm called it \"one of the worst decisions I've seen in 50 years of public health preparedness work.\"",
      "\"If an influenza pandemic hit us tomorrow, the global flu vaccine manufacturing capacity using the standard method of growing the virus in chicken eggs would only produce enough vaccine in 18 months to vaccinate just one fourth of the world,\" he told CBS News. \"We desperately need a vaccine technology where we could make enough vaccine for the world in a year.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 a physician who chairs the Senate health committee \u2014 called Kennedy's decision \"unfortunate\" and said he's \"wasting the money which is already invested.\"",
      "\"He has also conceded to China an important technology needed to combat cancer and infectious disease,\" Cassidy wrote on X.",
      "Many experts say a major advantage of mRNA vaccines is that they can be developed, manufactured and changed quickly, allowing drugmakers and public health officials to respond rapidly to novel viruses and to constantly mutating viruses like the flu.",
      "In 2020, the first Trump administration funded the development of Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed significantly faster than traditional vaccines.",
      "\"No other nation matched what America achieved during the pandemic,\" Dr. Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council, told CBS News. \"We pioneered and delivered life-saving mRNA vaccines at unprecedented speed. It's a historic accomplishment we should celebrate. Clinging to outdated technologies to counter a future flu pandemic is a grave mistake.\"",
      "Kennedy has a\u00a0long history\u00a0of\u00a0raising doubts\u00a0about vaccines. Since he joined the Trump administration, he has fired members of an expert panel that made vaccine recommendations, and announced the removal of a recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still says children may get the vaccine and that it is safe and beneficial for pregnant women.",
      "Kennedy said Tuesday that HHS is moving the now-canceled funding to \"safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\"",
      "\"Let me be absolutely clear: HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,\" the health secretary said.",
      "Nick  Kurtz, \n                                                  \n                                  Dr. C\u00e9line  Gounder and \n                                                  \n                      Stephanie  Stahl\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Hate crime charges have been filed against the man accused in the shooting deaths of\u00a0two Israeli Embassy staffers\u00a0in Washington, D.C., earlier this year.",
      "A grand jury on Wednesday indicted Elias Rodriguez, 31, on the additional counts of hate crimes resulting in death. The indictment includes\u00a0special findings\u00a0which would allow the Justice Department to pursue the death penalty in the case.",
      "Rodriguez is already charged with two counts of first-degree murder, murder of foreign officials and other counts for the shooting that killed Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26, two employees at the Israeli Embassy in Washington who were leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum on May 21.",
      "He is also charged with causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said at the time of the shooting that the attack was being investigated as a hate crime and terrorism.",
      "President Trump has sought to expand the use of the death penalty, directing his Justice Department to seek capital punishment \"for all crimes of a severity demanding its use\" in a January executive order. Under federal law, the death penalty is only permitted for certain crimes like homicide or treason, and some aggravating factor \u2014 like murdering a diplomat or kidnapping resulting in murder \u2014 must be present.",
      "According to charging documents, video shows that after Rodriguez allegedly shot the couple, he walked closer to them and fired \"several more times.\" Milgrim sat up after being shot, and he reloaded his weapon and fired again at her, striking her, the documents allege.",
      "In all, 21 rounds were fired from a 9 mm weapon, according to the court documents. A firearm magazine was found at the scene, and a handgun with its slide locked was found nearby.",
      "Federal officials traced the weapon and say records show it was purchased by Rodriguez on March 6, 2020, in Illinois. The handgun was purchased legally, according to a person briefed on the investigation.",
      "Once officers arrived at the museum, Rodriguez asked to speak with police and told them, \"I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza, I am unarmed,\" according to the charging documents. Rodriguez was then taken into custody.",
      "FBI Washington Assistant Director Steven Jensen said the suspect, who lived in Chicago, came to Washington, D.C., on May 20 and was traveling for a work conference. He flew from Chicago O'Hare Airport to Reagan National Airport with the firearm in checked luggage and had declared the firearm, according to court documents.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that airs on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 3, 2025. This interview was taped on Aug. 1, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by United States Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer. Ambassador, good to have you here.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Great to be here. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President signed this executive order on Thursday, raises tariff rates on about 70 countries. Should we expect those to be negotiated down in the coming days?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: I don't, I don't think they will be in the coming days. I think a lot of these, well I know a lot of these, are set rates pursuant to deals. Some of these deals are announced,\u00a0 some are not, others depend on the level of the trade deficit or surplus we may have with the country. So, so these, these tariff rates are pretty much set. I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the President's tariff plan right now with these rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was reading some interviews you had given, and you said at some point the President's view is maybe a tariff is better than a deal. Are you saying there are countries that just, they have no shot of avoiding a tariff?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Well, I would say that, in fact, most countries in the world, they just have a tariff assigned to them, right? Whether it's\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It'll be the 10 percent or 15 percent.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: 10 or 15 or the higher level tariff. Because, again, when the President is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do. And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this. And you know, sometimes a country will come back and make additional concessions that, that make it more appropriate. He's trying to get at the deficit. He's trying to reshore manufacturing. And so those are the factors he's looking at when he's looking at when he's determining whether he's just going to have a tariff or he'll take a deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trying to reshore manufacturing, bring manufacturing jobs back to America. But we just saw in this unemployment data that while the level is pretty low overall, it's pretty steady, good. Manufacturing in particular, we saw it contract for the fifth straight month in July, factory employment dropped to lowest levels in five years. What does that data indicate to you about the impact of your tariffs?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Yeah, I saw that and my own view is that I think a lot of companies were waiting to see if the tax bill was going to come through with the expensing for capital goods and things like that. And so I think now you know a lot of that data comes pre \"One Big Beautiful Bill\". Now that we have \"One Big Beautiful Bill\", and we have a better sense of where the taxes are going, I think we're going to see a much, we're going to see more investment, all the, all the commitments on investment we've seen countries making, that's going to come through. And like you said, it's a relatively small number. So I don't, I don't read tariff policy into that number. I think that is kind of pre-bill policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you believe the executives are making strategic decisions with hiring, but the President just announced that the head of Labor Statistics is being fired because of the weak jobs report, claiming the data was faked.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Well, I think you know, and I saw what the president did, and he also talked about the, just the record from BLS, you know, last year\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Labor Statistics Bureau.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: That's right, yeah, exactly. You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers and so it sounds to me like the President has real concerns. You know, not just based on today's but everything we saw last year. You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways. And it's, you know, the President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you were just saying you weren't really doubting the data.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: No, I wasn't\u2013 You asked me what I thought about the data\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:",
      "Right.",
      "JAMIESON GREER:\u2013And was it reflected in the tariff policy? The answer is no. I mean, my view is, to the extent that there's some kind of, you know, information about manufacturing jobs, you know, I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the \"one big, beautiful bill\" passed, now that we have the expensing going in. And I think that, you know, our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you confident, though \u2013 because you have to deal in legal terms, in details, with facts and data when you are negotiating a legal agreement \u2013 do you trust that if you bring hard data to the president, he takes your counsel, even if it's an inconvenient fact?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Always, yes. I mean, I've spent the- I spend many hours with the president almost every day, and that's what we're talking about is data. We're looking - and I'm on the trade side, of course - and we're looking at import figures, export figures, investment levels, et cetera. And that's how we're making this decision. So I'm very comfortable with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've seen that Apple estimates, for the full year, tariffs are going to cost them more than a billion dollars. For the automakers - GM, Stellantis, Ford - they all came out and said they are going to take a hit from this.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, so that's exactly the issue, right? We have, over decades, we've had these large manufacturers, advanced manufacturing, that have gone overseas. They've gone to other countries. They've taken advantage of unfair trading practices, and the fact that the US has had low tariffs while other countries haven't, and they've taken advantage of that. That's what businesses do. We're all capitalists. And so if now they have to pay a tariff or build here, the President is creating incentives to bring them back here. That's why GM has announced investments here in the United States, and that's why we have all these companies and countries announcing investment in the US. Because the tariffs create the incentive to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But reductions in profits come at a cost, right? And as CEOs are making decisions, how long do you expect this pain to last for corporate America?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, you know, again, when we look at- you know, when we look at the numbers and the data, we're seeing predictions of more investment here. That's what we want. The President isn't doing this so much for the companies. He's doing it for American workers who have seen their jobs offshored to Mexico, to Vietnam, to China. So when we hear companies having to make hard choices about supply chain changes. We have to do that. I mean the status quo, where we keep making things overseas, because we can do it a little bit cheaper in the short run. That is not preferable to having that investment and employment here in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we haven't seen that reshoring happen.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, we have- we have announced AstraZeneca announced they're going to have a $50 billion investment in pharmaceuticals. GM has announced $5 billion. Hyundai Steel has said they're going to do a $21 billion investment in Louisiana. So this is- this is actually happening. These are things from the company saying it right, and they have to say it. And they have, you know, earnings reports, and they have and- they have filings. They can't just make this stuff up. This is real investment that we're seeing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about Canada, which is our second largest- largest trading partner. The president increased tariffs to 35%. It applies, though, to just about 10% of what Canada sells here. Why bother to do this now in the middle of negotiations?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So I would say, first of all, you know, Canada is subject to 50% tariffs on steel, aluminum. 25% tariffs on autos, and again, the 35% tariff on- on goods that don't follow the rules of USMCA. And, you know, early on, the president posed a 25% tariff on Canada, and that was really about fentanyl and border issues, right? It's- it's- it's a separate regime from the reciprocal tariff. And what did Canada do in response? You know, they talked about helping at the border. And I'm not, you know, I'm not the drug czar or anything. But what I do know, as the trade guy, is that Canada retaliated. The only other country in the world who retaliated on tariffs was the Chinese. And so if the president's going to take an action and the Canadians retaliate, the United States needs to maintain the integrity of our action, the effectiveness. So we have to go up too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're talking about the things that the former Prime Minister Trudeau put in place, not the\u00a0 current Prime Minister--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: -- And are still in place--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- That are still in place. But the current prime minister has held off, largely, on retaliation here. That's the guy you're negotiating with and his team. So what's the strategy here? And aren't you worried that this will hurt the broader free trade deal if you truly do want to renegotiate it next year.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well- well, the President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system. So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN : So I hear you drawing distinctions when you say I'm the trade guy, I'm not the drug czar.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm the trade guy. I'm not handling these other things. But the President is kind of blending all these things together, because he cited fentanyl once again when it came to tariffs-\u00a0 to the policy with Canada. He also said on social media, Canada's decision to back statehood for Palestine is going to make it hard for us to make a trade deal. How does that have anything to do with financial and trade agreements?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So, so- so, first of all, the president United States has his foreign affairs power where he can- he can manage relations under the Constitution with foreign countries. Second of all, you know, Congress delegated to the president the ability to take economic action in response to national emergencies in the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. And for example, the Treasury Department, they have a number of sanctions where they can actually cut off a country's trade with the United States, prohibit goods, cut them off from our financial system for geopolitical reasons. So the fact that they can do that- almost certainly the President can do something that's not as expansive and just- and just put a fee on those goods, which is a- which is a tariff. So if you--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But can and should are different things, right? And- and I'm asking this--",
      "JAMIESON GREER: --But to- to go- but- but listen, if you're going to sanction somebody and essentially prohibit trade, you almost certainly can do something that's softer, which is to allow the trade and just put a tariff on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Brazil, because the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil. That means, you know, we sell them more than we buy from them. So it doesn't seem to be consistent here, when you have the President put 50% tariffs on Brazil, one of the highest of any countries. And at the same time, the President is bringing up things that have nothing to do with trade when he's justifying them. He sent a letter to the current government complaining about the prosecution of his ally, Bolsonaro, who is- who allegedly staged a coup when he lost the last election. The President called it a witch hunt. This seems politically motivated and not about trade.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, two things. First of all, there's a 10% tariff on Brazil because we have a surplus with them. That's the reciprocal tariff. And then there's a 40% tariff that the President has chosen to do under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, like we would do any sanction where we see geopolitical issues. The President has seen in Brazil, like he's seen in other countries, a misuse of law, a misuse of democracy, what one might call lawfare. It is normal to use these tools for geopolitical issues. I mean, sanctions, we've been using them for years with all kinds of countries, including countries we like--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You view tariffs and sanctions as the same?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: They're just different in degree. I mean, tariffs are actually lighter than a sanction- a sanction, you're cutting off a country from your financial system. You're prohibiting trade with them. A tariff, you're allowing trade. You're just putting a fee on it. It's a- it's a lesser",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: step than sanctions--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You- you have moved far away from from dealing with the deficit. Now--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: --Well the deficit has a 10% tariff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --you are talking about politically motivated trade actions here. I mean, the president sent a letter to President Lula, saying that tariffs are due in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on free elections. He also, at the same time, sanctioned the Supreme Court justice overseeing Bolsonaro's trial. Why are you trying to influence a criminal trial of an ally of President Trump?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So, so, so the president of United States, historically, whether it's a Democrat or Republican, they have used IEEPA to impose sanctions for all kinds of geopolitical reasons in all kinds of countries. Sometimes it's countrywide, sometimes it's specific to certain, you know, individuals and often foreign leaders and foreign officials. So this is not, this is not way outside the market. If anything, the President could have gone farther in the type of sanction that was used. Instead he just used a tariff instead of cutting them off from the financial system altogether.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you were fully on board with it. It sounds like.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: With the president of the United States? My boss? Of course I am--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But with intervening in criminal trials--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: --when the President--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- through trade policy.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: When the President sees lawfare going on, he's going to impose a sanction through IEEPA that's been delegated by Congress. That's his job as the president. He's elected to assess the Foreign Affairs situation in the United States and take appropriate action. There's just no question that it's both from a legal perspective, it's completely permissible. And from a policy perspective, that's what he's elected to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to trade, the big deal that is pending out there is how is the president going to deal with China? There's an August 12 deadline, and if that deadline is not met, you have said tariff levels could snap back to above 80%. Is that deadline going to slide?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So that's what's under discussion right now. I would say that our conversations with the Chinese have been very positive. We have discussions at the staff level, at my level, you know, President Xi and President Trump have had conversations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They said that it's sliding. The Chinese said it's sliding.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: That's something we're working toward. That's what we talked about--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not there yet.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: And so, so they want to do that. We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it, you know, I think it's going in a positive direction. You know, I'm not going to get ahead of the President, but, you know, I don't think anyone wants to see those tariffs snap back to 84%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you get any commitments in those two days of talks in Stockholm?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So yes, we did. Yes, we talked about, and I won't go into detail, because they're, you know, confidential conversations between two, two governments, but they really focused on rare earth magnets and minerals. You've probably heard some about that, that China has put a global control on the world, and so for the United States, we're focused on making sure that the flow of magnets from from China to the United States and the- and the adjacent supply chain can flow as freely as it did before the control, and I'd say we're about halfway there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Greer, thank you for your time today.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Thank you so much.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/noaa-hurricane-season-forecast-2025/",
    "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 13:47:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Two months into the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, NOAA forecasters updated their prediction for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect.",
    "story": [
      "Two months into the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have updated their forecast, predicting slightly fewer named storms. The new outlook released Thursday says there is a 50% chance of above-normal activity, a decrease from 60% in the agency's May forecast.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, now expects 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine of which could become hurricanes, including two to five major hurricanes. The previous ranges were 13 to 19 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes.",
      "The adjusted predictions include the four named tropical storms so far this season.",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, a combination of factors influence the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the NOAA outlook says, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to\u00a0prepare.",
      "\"NOAA stands ready to provide the forecasts and warnings that are vital for safeguarding lives, property, and communities,\" acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a statement Thursday. \"As we enter the second half of the season, this updated hurricane outlook serves as a call to action to prepare now, in advance, rather than delay until a warning is issued.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "Researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "They also recently updated their predictions, now estimating that eight hurricanes will occur over the course of the 2025 season with 16 named storms overall.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",

    "summary": "A sea star wasting disease\u200b sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska, devastating more than 20 species and continuing today.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule homed in on the International Space Station early Saturday and glided in for a problem-free docking \u2014 delivering two NASA astronauts, a Russian cosmonaut and a Japanese flier \u2014 to the outpost after a 16-hour rendezvous.",
      "Catching up from behind and below, the Crew 11 Dragon Endeavour looped up ahead of the lab complex, then to a point directly above the outpost before slowly moving straight in for a linkup at the space-facing port of the forward Harmony module at 2:27 a.m. ET as the two spacecraft orbited 264 miles above the south Pacific Ocean.",
      "Hooks and latches then engaged, pulling the Crew Dragon's nose firmly into the docking mechanism, which locked the craft in place. Umbilicals automatically connected and flight controllers began a series of leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal.",
      "\"Endeavour, welcome to the International Space Station,\" called NASA astronaut Jonny Kim from inside the ISS. \"Zena, Mike, Kimi and Oleg, we have cold drinks, hot food and hugs waiting. See you soon.\"",
      "\"Hello space station, Crew 11 is here!\" Endeavour pilot Mike Fincke, a three-flight veteran, enthusiastically replied. \"And we are super excited to join Expedition 73. We will do our best to also be good stewards of our beautiful ISS during our stay. The ISS has been inhabited and crewed for almost 25 years. We look forward to celebrating with you.\"",
      "Nearly three hours later, after doffing their spacesuits and configuring their capsule for docked operations, Fincke, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, making her first flight, Japanese veteran Kimiya Yui and rookie cosmonaut Oleg Platonov floated through the forward hatch to be welcomed aboard by the space station's seven-member crew.",
      "\"We are so happy to see your smiling faces,\" said ISS commander Takuya Onishi. \"Zena, Oleg, congratulations on your first spaceflight. We are looking forward to hearing your impressions and your feelings about that. Mike and Kimiya, welcome back. Your experience will be an invaluable asset for Expedition 73.\"",
      "Cardman was bumped from a Crew Dragon flight last year to help NASA bring two Starliner astronauts back to Earth after problems prevented them from coming home on their own spacecraft. She was clearly thrilled to finally be aboard the space station.",
      "\"This has been the absolute journey of a lifetime,\" she said with a broad smile. \"We are so incredibly grateful to be here. Thank you so much for this warm welcome. It was such an unbelievably beautiful sight to see the space station come into our view for the first time, especially with these wonderful crewmates.\"",
      "With the arrival of Crew 11, four of the station's crew members \u2014 Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 will be clear to undock and return to Earth next Wednesday to close out a 145-day mission.",
      "The other three \u2014 Kim and Soyuz MS-27/73S crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky \u2014 will remain aboard with Cardman and company to continue Expedition 73.",
      "Until now, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit with Crew 11.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25% while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money.",
      "No final decisions have been made. But NASA is assessing the possibility of extending Crew 11's stay in space from six to eight months, depending on the actual funding outlook.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" Cardman said before launch. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

      "As part of the new model, OpenAI is also reigning in ChatGPT's flattery. In its blog post, the company said GPT\u20115 is \"less effusively agreeable\" and that it will use \"fewer unnecessary emojis.\"",
      "OpenAI has also stepped up ChatGPT's coding abilities, allowing users to build websites, apps and games from scratch. In a demo during Wednesday's call, Altman used ChatGPT-5 to create another large language model in less than 5 minutes.",

      "\"We wanted to test the guardrails,\" said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \"The visceral initial response is, 'Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.' The rails are completely ineffective. They're barely there - if anything, a fig leaf.\"",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
      "\"If someone expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, ChatGPT is trained to encourage them to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones, and provide links to crisis hotlines and support resources,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're focused on getting these kinds of scenarios right: we are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately, pointing people to evidence-based resources when needed, and continuing to improve model behavior over time - all guided by research, real-world use, and mental health experts.\"",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or require parental consent, although the company says it is not meant for children under 13. To sign up, users need to enter a birth date showing an age of at least 13, or they can use a limited guest account without entering an age at all.",
      "\"If you have access to a child's account, you can see their chat history. But as of now, there's really no way for parents to be flagged if, say, your child's question or their prompt into ChatGPT is a concerning one,\" CBS News senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent reported on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl, with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\"I started crying,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \"for a presentation\" or a friend.",
      "\"Emotional overreliance\" on technology",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. More people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to\u00a0AI chatbots for companionship\u00a0and half use AI companions regularly, according to\u00a0a recent study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \"emotional overreliance\" on the technology, describing it as a \"really common thing\" with young people.",
      "\"People rely on ChatGPT too much,\"\u00a0Altman said at\u00a0a conference. \"There's young people who just say, like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.\"",
      "Altman said the company is \"trying to understand what to do about it.\"",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \"it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\"",
      "ChatGPT generates something new \u2014 a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can't do. And AI, he added, \"is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.\"",
      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\"Write a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\" asked a researcher. \"Absolutely,\" responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \"emotionally exposed\" while \"still respecting the community's coded language.\"",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT's self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \"fundamentally designed to feel human,\" said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \"moderate risk\" for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it's not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to\u00a0take more meaningful steps\u00a0toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\"I'm 50kg and a boy,\" said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \"Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\" that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\"What it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, 'Chug, chug, chug, chug,'\" said Ahmed. \"A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say 'no' \u2014 that doesn't always enable and say 'yes.' This is a friend that betrays you.\"",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",
      "\"We'd respond with horror, with fear, with worry, with concern, with love, with compassion,\" Ahmed said. \"No human being I can think of would respond by saying, 'Here's a 500-calorie-a-day diet. Go for it, kiddo.'\"",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

      "Screen time doesn't just affect mental health. It may also take a toll on the physical health of\u00a0children and teens, according to new research.",
      "Published in the Journal of the American Heart Association Wednesday, the research found 10- and 18-year-olds who spent more time focused on devices, including phones, televisions, computers and gaming consoles, were at higher risk for cardiometabolic diseases, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and insulin resistance.",
      "The study used data from more than 1,000 participants in two Danish studies. Researchers gave a score to each participant representing their risk for the diseases compared to the average risk of the group, measured in standard deviations, with 0 meaning average risk and 1 meaning one standard deviation above average.",
      "Each extra hour of screen time increased the patient's overall risk by about 0.08 standard deviations in 10-year-olds and by 0.13 standard deviations in 18-year-olds, the study's authors said.",
      "\"It's a small change per hour, but when screen time accumulates to three, five or even six hours a day, as we saw in many adolescents, that adds up,\" lead author David Horner, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said in a news release.",
      "Researchers found 18-year-olds were on devices about six hours a day, on average, while 10-year-olds averaged three hours a day.",
      "They also found sleep impacted the results, with both less sleep and later bedtimes amplifying the relationship between screen time and heart health risks. That suggests screen time may harm health by \"stealing\" time from sleep, they said.",
      "\"Limiting discretionary screen time in childhood and adolescent may protect long-term heart and metabolic health,\" Horner said. \"Our study provides evidence that this connection starts early and highlights the importance of having balanced daily routines.\"",
      "The research was observational, meaning it found associations rather than proved cause and effect. It also had some limitations, including that participants self-reported screen time, which might not accurately reflect how much time they were actually on devices.",
      "It adds to a growing body of research about the possible effects of screen time and digital devices on young people's health and well-being. In 2023, the U.S. surgeon general urged parents to create \"tech-free zones\" for kids.",

      "The U.S. job market, already showing the strain from global trade tensions, is showing early signs of another critical issue facing workers today: artificial intelligence.",
      "For the first seven months of 2025, rising adoption of generative AI technology by private employers accounted for more than 10,000 job cuts, according to a report released this week by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market.

    "summary": "In her first public one-on-one interview since 10 inmates broke out of a city jail just outside downtown New Orleans in May, Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson says more jail staff members may be held responsible.",
    "story": [
      "New Orleans \u2014 The sheriff who oversees a New Orleans jail that was the site of a brash escape of 10 inmates earlier this year told CBS News in an exclusive interview Thursday that prison staffing and design flaws played a major role in the breakout.",
      "Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson   said the Orleans Parish Justice Center jail, built 10 years ago, was poorly constructed from the start.",
      "\"There are major design flaws in it that make it unsafe for those who are housed here and make it unsafe for those who work here,\" Hutson told CBS News. \"And I included the locks and other mechanisms that I don't want to talk about on camera that are safety issues. But we talked about this, and we alerted everybody in the system.\"",
      "The May 16 escape prompted an extensive manhunt involving hundreds of local, state, and federal law enforcement officers. It underscored serious security failures at the facility that prompted significant criticism for Hutson even though she had spoken about the problems in a public tour of the jail just a few weeks prior. She even posted on Instagram about broken locks just three days earlier, on May 13. And in the days after the escape, Hutson told reporters that the city had ignored repeated requests from her over the past several years to fund necessary renovations and security upgrades to the jail.",
      "She told CBS News Thursday that the timeline of the jailbreak dates back to the facility's construction. The jail is currently undergoing an audit with the National Institute of Corrections, which is reviewing its finances and security systems.",
      "She also says the jail is currently only 60% staffed, up from a 45% staffing level when she was first elected to the post in the fall of 2021.",
      "\"We need more people in this jail to secure it, and that didn't happen,\" Hutson said. \"So, for the last three years, I've been saying this every year during budget cycle, every chance I get that I have a chance to speak to the city government, and it's not been rectified. So here we come to May. Now it comes full circle. The perfect storm is there. We had people in our organization who assisted here.\"",
      "During the escape, part of which was captured on surveillance video, the inmates removed a jail cell door off its track and ripped a toilet from an empty jail cell wall. The inmates crawled through a hole in the wall behind the toilet, made their way through a narrow plumbing room full of pipes, and broke out of a maintenance door onto an outdoor loading dock. The inmates then climbed a fence that separated the Orleans Parish Justice Center from the construction site of another jail facility, and eventually sprinted across a freeway.",
      "All but one of the ten inmates has since been captured.",
      "Hutson has previously described the breakout as an \"inside job.\" More than a dozen people have been arrested on accusations of aiding in the escape, but only one of those arrestees was a jail employee, a maintenance worker identified as 33-year-old Sterling Williams. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.",
      "CBS News also previously learned that several jail guards were placed on paid administrative leave amid a state investigation into their potential involvement in the jailbreak.",
      "Hutson still believes the escape was an inside job, but says there is still a tedious investigation ahead into who else should be held responsible.",
      "\"There are about 900 cameras in the Orleans Justice Center,\" Hutson said. \"It takes a long time to go through those and look and see who did what. But I can absolutely guarantee you that we know there were more actors involved in this.\"",
      "Last month, the sheriff's office received $15 million in emergency funding from the state to make critical security upgrades to the jail. Hutson blames the delay in receiving those funds on \"some actors in the system\" who \"do not want to see me succeed.\"",
      "\"This is political office, and there are challenges to that,\" Hutson said. \"And in this election cycle \u2014 and there are members of government supporting those challengers, no doubt. But I know this, the timing is very curious.\"",
      "She says that her team is \"doing everything we can\" to capture the last outstanding inmate, Derrick Groves, who was convicted of murder in 2024 for the shooting deaths of two men.",
      "\"But we know he's getting help also out there in the community, which is a little shocking, that given what his history is, and his history of violence is, that he's getting that help,\" Hutson said. \"...I do believe we will find him. It's just a matter of time.\"",

      "But violent crime in D.C. has tapered off, decreasing since the start of 2024; it's part of a larger nationwide drop in murder rates that has hit its lowest level in decades. D.C Police data show assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 19% year-to-date compared with 2024, while robberies have fallen by 39 percent, compared to last year. In 2025, there have also been 14 fewer homicides to date \u2013 a drop of 12%, compared to the same period last year.",

      "The footage, from a body camera worn by a Metropolitan Police Department officer, was first published Thursday by NPR. The network joined CBS News and other news organizations in suing to obtain thousands of hours of surveillance footage and court exhibits from the more than 1,000 criminal cases brought by the Justice Department against people who allegedly participated in the Capitol attack.",
      "Among those defendants was Jared Wise, who eventually faced six charges as a result of his alleged actions on Jan. 6. He pleaded not guilty. Wise's hiring by the Justice Department was reported last month. A Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement that Wise \"is a valued member of The Department of Justice and we appreciate his contributions to our team.\"",
      "Wise was employed as a special agent and supervisory special agent with the FBI from 2004 through 2017, according to the Justice Department.",
      "He was indicted in May 2023 on six counts that arose out of his alleged actions on Jan. 6, when a violent mob of President Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol building to protest the 2020 election results. Among the charges was one count of civil disorder and one count of assaulting, resisting or impeding an officer of the U.S. performing their official duties.",
      "In accompanying court papers, an FBI agent said that video footage depicted Wise inside the Capitol building on the afternoon of Jan. 6 after entering from a Senate door. Body camera footage from the Metropolitan Police Department also showed Wise engaging with police officers outside the Capitol, telling them, \"You guys are disgusting. I'm former \u2014 I'm former law enforcement. You're disgusting. You are the Nazi. You are the Gestapo. You can't see it because you're chasing a pension, right? Your pension. Your retirement right?\"",
      "The footage shows him continuing to yell at the officers, telling them, \"Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you!\"",
      "When police who were attempting to move protesters back from the Capitol were knocked to the ground in front of Wise, the video shows him shouting toward them \"Yeah, f*** them! Yeah, kill 'em!\" He also allegedly yelled toward rioters attacking a police line, \"Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Kill 'em!\"",
      "Wise had lived in New Braunfels, Texas, until June 2022, after which he moved to Bend, Oregon, according to court records. An unidentified tipster told the FBI in January 2022 that Wise shared he was inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, the agent said. The FBI then obtained a court-authorized search warrant for Wise's records, which confirmed he was around the Capitol that day, according to the filing.",
      "Wise pleaded not guilty to the charges in June 2023. A trial was set to begin last fall and was ultimately held in January. But before the jury could begin deliberating, Mr. Trump issued blanket pardons to roughly 1,500 defendants charged for their alleged role in the Jan. 6 attack.",
      "The Justice Department asked the court to dismiss Wise's case on Jan. 20, the day of Mr. Trump's inauguration, and it was granted one day later, filings show.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 20:21:59 -0400",
    "summary": "Profit hits and price hikes are already coming down the pike as a result of new U.S. tariffs, according to economists.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs, which\u00a0went into effect on Thursday, are likely to have a negative effect on companies' bottom lines and cause consumer prices to rise, trade experts say.",
      "With the new duties on imports from dozens of U.S. trade partners now in place, Mr. Trump's foreign trade policy is expected to lead to even more dramatic cost increases for American companies and consumers, according to economists.",
      "\"Even if they might not raise prices immediately, it's unlikely that most businesses are just going to be willing to eat the extra costs forever,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, an online lending marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of tariffs on consumer prices was initially muted, explained Shulz, as firms can be reluctant to be the first among their competitors to institute price hikes. While some companies waited to see where tariff rates settled before adjusting retail prices, others took steps to absorb added costs to avoid turning off customers. But companies can't employ such measures forever, according to experts.",
      "\"You don't want to be the first to raise prices, even if you have a perfectly legitimate reason for doing so,\" Schulz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So, I suspect once we see businesses start raising their prices more, that might embolden others to do so as well.\"",
      "That could mean a tsunami of price hike announcements from corporations, some of which have already warned of tariff impacts, or instituted \"tariff surcharges\" to cover their added costs.",
      "To date, Mr. Trump's tariffs on the U.S.'s trade partners have generated billions of dollars in revenue for the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. government collected about $30 billion in tariff revenue in July, according to the Treasury Department. That reflects a 242% jump in revenue collected from duties since July 2024.",
      "In addition to paying down the national debt, which currently stands at\u00a0more than $36 trillion, those billions in new tariff revenue may be used to issue\u00a0rebate checks for Americans, Mr. Trump suggested last month.",
      "Profit dips",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "\"There is very little evidence that foreign exporters to the U.S. are reducing their prices,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're not seeing broad-based evidence of price cuts by countries, and that's an indication that foreign exporters realize that it's U.S. importers, U.S. businesses and eventually consumers that are bearing the brunt of this tariff-induced inflation acceleration.\"",
      "Companies from personal electronics companies to automakers have already experienced the damaging effects of Mr. Trump's foreign trade policies on profits.",
      "On Thursday Toyota, the world's largest auto maker, reported a 37% drop in profit in the April-June quarter and said it cut its full-year earnings forecast largely because of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Other auto makers have also said they expect to see profit drops as a result of the new levies.",
      "GM has projected a tariff hit of up to $5 billion for 2025, and Ford has said tariffs will cost the company $3 billion in revenue for the year.",
      "Liquor companies are in the tariff crosshairs, too. Guinness maker Diageo said it expects tariffs to cost it $200 million a year.",
      "Walmart in May warned that higher tariffs would force it to increase prices on a wide range of items at its stores, from bananas to children's car seats.",
      "Price hikes",
      "Some companies have said outright that in order to bear the added costs from the new tariffs they'll have to pass along some of the pain to consumers in the form of price hikes.",
      "For example, popular consumer electronics marker Sonos, which makes speakers, said on its third-quarter earnings call Wednesday that it would raise prices on its audio devices as a result of\u00a0higher reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Malaysia, where Sonos devices for the U.S. market are made.",
      "Overall, as a result of the levies, Americans are expected to pay an average of 18.3% more for imported products,\u00a0according to the Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "EY-Parthenon's Daco told CBS MoneyWatch that the higher costs being paid by companies because of tariffs is already starting to trickle down to product prices.",
      "Currently, the average tariff rate stands at around 18% \u2014 the highest it's been in decades, according to Daco. As a result, \"the increase in the tariffs will only exacerbate inflationary pressure that [is] starting to emerge,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"You're going to see more durable goods, and nondurable goods products with higher price tags,\" he said. \"That will feed into higher consumer price inflation and lead to a more pronounced erosion of consumer spending as more households struggle in the face of these higher prices.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing. He has also tried to assure the public that foreign producers will pay for the import taxes and has told retailers and automakers\u00a0to absorb the additional expenses.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS News.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been four months since Liberation Day and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent CEA analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining.\"",

    "summary": "Under a new executive order signed by President Trump, workers could add higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies to their 401(k)s.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that could allow millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts to invest in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency assets.",
      "The executive order doesn't immediately change how people will invest for retirement through their employer-sponsored accounts, as federal agencies would need to rewrite regulations to allow expanded investment choices. That's a process that experts say could take months, or longer, to complete.",
      "But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate.",
      "The move comes as the 401(k) has become the primary vehicle for American workers to save for retirement, with most employers offering a menu of investment choices among major asset classes, such as stock-based mutual funds. The $5 trillion private equity industry, which makes investments into private businesses rather than publicly traded stocks, has for decades wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans.",
      "At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump's 2024 campaign, has aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans.",
      "\"It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)'s,\" said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. \"As fiduciaries realize bitcoin's risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we'll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.\"",
      "The EO could give private equity and crypto firms long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions.",
      "Investment companies applauded Mr. Trump's executive order, with TIAA, which manages the retirement assets of teachers, professors and other academics, and investing giant BlackRock saying they support the measure for providing a broader number of investment strategies to workers.",
      "\"We believe end investors can benefit from the advantages that private investments can offer when embedded within professionally managed vehicles like target date funds or through guaranteed annuity products,\" TIAA said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Changing the 401(k) rules",
      "The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA. Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",
      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for the major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are not likely to revise their retirement plan options quickly as well, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments are mainstream in an individual's retirement plan.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected.",
      "Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with \"extreme care\" because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic.",
      "For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump's campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump's military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security.",
      "Crypto investors",
      "Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash.",
      "Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a \"dream\" of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets.",
      "Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, had agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans.",

    "story": [
      "New Orleans \u2014 Louisiana's coast is under threat as a quarter of the state's wetlands, an area about the size of Delaware, have disappeared in the last 100 years, according to the\u00a0U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "The wetlands are a critical buffer that shield Louisiana communities from monster hurricanes.",
      "While massive flood walls and human-made marshes are helpful, coastal scientist  Alisha Renfro and campaign director  Simone Maloz with the nonprofit group Restore the Mississippi River Delta say those projects alone are not enough to rebuild and counteract future projected land loss.",
      "\"You can reduce storm surge up to a foot with just a mile of coastal wetlands,\" Renfro told CBS News.",
      "\"A tough lesson that we learned after Katrina: we have to think long term. We also have to think bigger,\" Maloz added.",
      "It's been 20 years since Hurricane Katrina exposed the extent of the state's coastal erosion. It was the largest residential disaster in U.S. history, killing more than 1,300 people and displacing one million others across the Gulf Coast, according to the Louisiana independent research nonprofit The Data Center.",
      "Since Katrina,\u00a0satellite images\u00a0from the NASA Earth Observatory show that the Louisiana coastline has lost even more marshland \u2014 an estimated 200,000 acres, according to the USGS.",
      "Land loss is caused by a number of factors, including sea level rise, shipping channels, levees, natural subsidence, invasive species and severe storms, according to Restore the Mississippi River Delta.",
      "Without the protection of wetlands, Maloz and Renfro say the future would be unsustainable for coastal Louisiana communities.",
      "\"I think that's a future we don't want to think about,\" Maloz said of the impact on the region if the wetlands were to disappear.",
      "\"It is a loss of culture,\" Renfro said. \"It is a loss of place and it is a loss of home for a lot of people.\"",
      "Last month, Louisiana officials canceled a $3 billion project\u00a0\u2014 known as the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion \u2014 that sought to rebuild the marshes.",
      "Renfro and Maloz spent years planning the diversion project with other state and federal leaders and scientists. The project was unique, because instead of a human-made marsh built by dredged sediment, it would have diverted sediment flowing down the Mississippi River to naturally rebuild wetlands, the way the Mississippi River Delta was first formed centuries ago.",
      "Renfro and Maloz saw it as the best solution to save Louisiana. They argue that other projects wouldn't be nearly as effective, nor would they have rebuilt as much land.",
      "\"If you don't change the forces that took that away from you in the first place... if you don't have a systemic change, then you're going to lose this too,\" Maloz said. \"And so that's what Mid-Barataria represented. It represented that systemic change that returned back to how we were created that gave us that long-term future. If you want to talk about dollars and cents, you're talking about investing money over 50 years, rather than investing X amount of money over 10 years or 20 years. But really it's the time and scale.\"",
      "The project would have diverted Mississippi sediment to rebuild 17,000 acres of land over the next 30 years, enough to potentially absorb up to 10 feet of storm surge, according to Restore the Mississippi River Delta.",
      "\"We are very short on money,\" Maloz added. \"We're short on natural resources. And we are short on time.\"",
      "Regardless, Louisiana's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority scrapped the project this summer, at the direction of Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, even though about $600 million of the $3 billion had already been spent.",
      "The project faced stark opposition from many community members in Plaquemines Parish, a small parish south of New Orleans.",
      "Mitch Jurisich, a third-generation oysterman, local businessman, and Plaquemines Parish councilman, filed a lawsuit to stop the project. He told CBS News he did so \"because I know what it would have done to our fishing industry, our commercial fishing industry here. And when you look around at this harbor, full of commercial boats, full of life, it would have just totally wiped us out.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said in July that the children in Gaza \"look very hungry. That's real starvation stuff,\" amid warnings of famine in Gaza from international humanitarian groups. Aid agencies have been calling for a surge of aid to the strip.",
      "\"I think that there are certainly people suffering in Gaza. Part of the reason is because you've had pallets and trucks for food that the U.N. won't take in \u2014 because they say they don't want military escort from the IDF \u2014 but they say it's not safe,\" Huckabee said. \"There's not been a lack of food or even a lack of attempt. It's been an inefficient way of getting it and it's been a problem because you have a terror organization who is stealing it, looting it, and then turning around and selling it to the people who are hungry.\"",
      "Desperate and starving people have been looting food trucks when they enter Gaza, but the World Food Program told CBS News there is no evidence food aid is being diverted to Hamas.",
      "\"I'm shocked they would say that,\" Huckabee said.",
      "Huckabee said food distribution sites run by the controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were proving effective in delivering aid to Palestinians in Gaza, and that the number of sites would be scaled up from four to 16, with the hubs potentially staying open 24 hours a day.",
      "According to the U.N., over 1,400 people have been killed trying to get food aid in Gaza, most of them, it says, as a result of IDF fire. Nearly 900 Palestinians have been killed near GHF sites.",
      "Throughout their months in operation, GHF sites have become flashpoints of desperation, with videos showing mass crowds of people gathering outside who have then come under fire from Israeli forces or been trampled in the resulting crush.",
      "The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots at people who approach its forces, and the GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots to control crowds.",
      "\"We've had reports that there have been incidences, but forgive me if I'm a little skeptical when someone says these people are being killed at the job site,\" Huckabee said. \"If there was some random shooting of people who were coming for food, those people would face severe consequences.\"",
      "On a two-state solution and what happens after the Israel-Hamas war",
      "Huckabee said that what happens to Palestinians living in Gaza after the war ends \"may depend on them \u2014 how many of them want to stay and rebuild their lives. We talked to some last week, and that's what they really want to do,\" Huckabee said.",
      "\"They know it's going to take years to rebuild their homes, their businesses, their families. They have their own vision for what that's going to look like. But there are undoubtedly many people who live there now who would love a way to leave and go somewhere else.\"",
      "Huckabee said no one should be forced to leave Gaza.",
      "\"They shouldn't be forced out. Nobody should be required to leave. And it's interesting that while there have been allegations that people are going to be forced out, both the U.S. and the government of Israel has been very clear: Nobody's going to be forced out, at least not by the U.S. And Israel has said it doesn't plan to force people to leave, but it wants people to have the freedom to start over, make a new life away from Gaza and away from the horrific memories they have that were inflicted upon them.\"",
      "When asked about whether he supported a two-state solution \u2014 the long-standing U.S. policy toward the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians \u2014 Huckabee said, \"It's really not an ambassador's position to make the decision of what that policy would be.\"",
      "\"It's sort of an aspirational goal: 'We need a two-state solution,'\" Huckabee said. \"But when you start asking people the specifics of what it looks like and where it's going to be. What are the boundaries? It's interesting that very few people have an answer for that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

      "By the end of 1945, about 210,000 people, mostly Japanese civilians and forced Korean laborers, had died. Some perished instantly in the blasts, others died later on from radiation poisoning. Pregnant women lost children in the aftermath, and thousands more civilians would fall victim to cancers and other side effects over the following decades.",

Only 12% of the regional capital's structures remained undamaged when the dust settled on the Southern Japanese island.",

Temporary structures had started to emerge a year after the bombing, but citywide rebuilding wouldn't begin until the passage of the Nagasaki International Culture City Reconstruction Law in 1949. Three years after nuclear weapons were deployed, charred tree trunks, stripped of their branches, stood near a sacred Torii Gate that survived the blast.",

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow on Wednesday, days before the White House's deadline for Russia to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or potentially face severe economic penalties that could also hit countries buying its oil.",
      "The meeting lasted about three hours, Russian state media said. Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said that Putin and Witkoff had a \"useful and constructive conversation\" that focused on the Ukrainian crisis and, in a nod toward improving relations between Washington and Moscow, \"prospects for possible development of strategic cooperation between the U.S. and Russia.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that the meeting was \"highly productive.\"",
      "\"Great progress was made! Afterwards, I updated some of our European Allies. Everyone agrees this War must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come,\" the president said.",

      "Dmitriev played a key role in three rounds of direct talks between delegations from Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul in recent months, as well as discussions between Russian and U.S. officials. The negotiations have made no progress on ending the three-year war following Russia's invasion of its neighbor.",

      "A senior Trump administration official said the meeting between Witkoff and Putin \"went well.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that Witkoff was on his way back to the U.S., adding that \"hopefully there'll be some announcements here fairly soon. Maybe positive, maybe not. We'll see.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed increasing frustration with Putin over Russia's escalating strikes on civilian areas of Ukraine, intended to erode morale and the public's appetite for the war. The intensified attacks have occurred even as Mr. Trump has urged the Russian leader in recent months to relent.",

      "\"There is zero military sense in this strike. Only cruelty to intimidate,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram.",
      "Western analysts and Ukrainian officials say Putin is stalling for time and avoiding serious negotiations while Russian forces push to capture more Ukraine land. A Russian offensive that started in the spring and is expected to continue through the fall is advancing faster than last year's push but is making only slow and costly gains and has been unable to take any major cities.",
      "The situation on the front line is critical for Ukrainian forces but defenses are not about to collapse, analysts say.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said \"we'll see what happens\" regarding his threat to slap tariffs on nations that buy Russian oil, which could increase import taxes dramatically on China and India.",
      "\"We have a meeting with Russia tomorrow,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to see what happens. We'll make that determination at that time.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is also pressuring India, a huge buyer along with China of Russian oil. On Wednesday, he\u00a0signed an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on India for buying Russian oil, on top of a 25% tariff he ordered last week.",
      "Stepping up diplomatic and economic pressure on the Kremlin risks stoking international tensions amid worsening Russia-U.S. relations. The Kremlin says threats to take steps against nations that trade with Russia are illegal.",
      "The Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis warned in an assessment this week that there are \"clear signs that the Kremlin is preparing for a broader confrontation with NATO,\" including a military build-up along Russia's western flank with alliance countries in recent years.",
      "Putin has given no hint that he might be ready to make concessions. Instead, the Russian leader and senior Kremlin officials have talked up the country's military strength.",
      "Putin announced last week that Russia's new hypersonic missile, which he says can't be intercepted by current NATO air defense systems, has entered service.",
      "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, meantime, warned that the Ukraine war could bring Russia and the U.S. into armed conflict. Mr. Trump responded to that by ordering the repositioning of two U.S. nuclear submarines.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday welcomed Witkoff's visit. \"We consider (talks with Witkoff) important, substantive and very useful,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump initially gave Moscow a 50-day deadline, but later moved up his ultimatum as the Kremlin continued to bomb Ukrainian cities.",
      "However, Mr. Trump himself doubted their effectiveness, saying Sunday that Russia has proven to be \"pretty good at avoiding sanctions.\"",
      "\"They're wily characters,\" he said of the Russians.",

      "A long-delayed and debated bridge linking the Italian mainland with Sicily cleared a major hurdle Wednesday, allowing work to begin on what would be the world's longest suspension bridge, despite concerns over earthquakes, environmental impacts and the threat of mafia interference.",
      "An interministerial committee with oversight of strategic public investments approved the 13.5 billion euro ($15.5 billion) project, the Transport Ministry said in a statement. Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said the project will be \"an accelerator for development\" in southern Italy.",
      "Preliminary work could begin later this summer with construction expected to start next year and, French news agency AFP points out, projected completion in 2032.",
      "The Strait of Messina Bridge has been approved and canceled multiple times since the Italian government first solicited proposals in 1969 and was most recently revived by Premier Giorgia Meloni's administration in 2023. The notion of constructing a link between Sicily and the mainland dates back to ancient Rome.",
      "The decision marks a political victory for Salvini, who has made the realization of the bridge a hallmark of his tenure, saying it would be \"a revolution\" for southern Italy by bringing jobs and economic growth.",
      "The Strait of Messina Bridge would measure nearly 3.7 kilometers (2.3 miles), with the suspended span reaching 3.3 kilometers (some 2 miles), surpassing Canakkale Bridge in Turkey, currently the longest, by 1,277 meters (4,189 feet). With four lanes of traffic flanked by a double-track railway, the bridge would have the capacity to carry 6,000 vehicles an hour and 200 trains a day.",
      "Controversy continuing",
      "AFP notes that some critics believe the span will never be built, pointing to a long history of public works announced and financed but still never finished in Italy.",
      "The project could provide a boost to Italy's commitment to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP targeted by NATO, as the government has indicated it would classify the bridge as defense-related, helping it to meet a 1.5% security component. Italy argues that the bridge would form a strategic corridor for rapid troop movements and equipment deployment to NATO's southern flanks, qualifying it as a \"security-enhancing infrastructure.\"",
      "A group of more than 600 professors and researchers signed a letter earlier this summer opposing the military classification, noting that such a move would require additional assessments to see if it could withstand military use. Opponents also say the designation would potentially make the bridge a target.",
      "Environmental groups have lodged additional complaints with the EU, citing concerns that the project will impact migratory birds, noting that environmental studies hadn't demonstrated that the project is a public imperative.",
      "The original government decree reactivating the bridge project included language giving the Interior Ministry control over anti-mafia measures. But Italy's president insisted that the project remain subject to anti-mafia legislation that applies to all large-scale infrastructure projects in Italy out of concerns that the ad-hoc arrangement would weaken controls.",
      "The project has been awarded to a consortium led by WeBuild, an Italian infrastructure group that initially won the bid to build the bridge in 2006 before the project was canceled in 2013. WeBuild constructed the Canakkale Bridge, which is currently the longest suspension bridge at 2 kilometers and 23 meters (about a mile and a quarter).",
      "The Canakkale Bridge, which opened in 2022, was built using the engineering model originally devised for the Messina Bridge, with a wing profile and a deck shape that resembles a fighter jet fuselage with openings to enable wind to pass through the structure, according to WeBuild.",
      "Addressing concerns about building the bridge over the Messina fault, which triggered a deadly quake in 1908, WeBuild has emphasized that suspension bridges are structurally less vulnerable to seismic forces. It noted that such bridges have been built in seismically active areas, including Japan, Turkey and California.",

      "Shields was just 15 years old when she starred in the Calvin Klein campaign, famously telling viewers that \"nothing\" comes between her and her jeans \u2013 a line that became controversial for its sexualization of a minor.",
      "In another commercial from the campaign, the \"Suddenly Susan\" star spoke to the camera and said, \"The secret of life lies hidden in the genetic code. Genes are fundamental in determining the characteristics of an individual and passing these characteristics on to succeeding generations. Occasionally, certain conditions produce a structural change in the genes, which will bring about the process of evolution.\"",
      "She went on to say this could occur by \"selective mating, in which a single gene type proves superior in transmitting its genes to future generations. Secondly by gene drift, in which certain genes may fade away\u00a0while other genes persist. And finally, by natural selection, which filters out those genes better equipped than others to endure in the environment. This may result in the origin of an entirely new species, which brings us to Calvins and the survival of the fittest.\"",

    "summary": "NATO faces growing hybrid warfare threats as Russian drone incursions into Lithuania and strikes near Romania&apos;s border raise questions about alliance unity and response.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker responds to the 'reckless threatening' on 'Fox & Friends First' amid a rush to transfer patriot missiles to Ukraine.",
      "Days ahead of the U.S. preparing harsh new sanctions tied to the war in Ukraine, Russian Vladimir Putin, whether intentionally or just carelessly, has tested the political will of NATO\u2019s collective defense guarantee, Article 5.",
      "In recent days, drones launched from the Russian-aligned state of Belarus have pierced Lithuanian airspace, drawing alarms from the region\u2019s political and military leaders. One drone traversed approximately 100 kilometers, loitered ominously over Vilnius carrying two kilograms of explosives and ultimately crashed inside a military training zone. Earlier in July, another drone forced the evacuation of high-level officials when it crashed near the \u0160umskas border crossing.",
      "Simultaneously, Russian forces struck a Ukrainian gas depot located mere yards from Romania\u2019s border half a mile away, a strike that triggered warnings and prompted Romanian F\u201116s to patrol the vicinity.",
      "Though these seem like isolated incidents, observers point to a troubling pattern. Russian drones have drifted \u2014 or perhaps even been directed \u2014 into NATO airspace before, and NATO\u2019s response has been muted.",
      "NEW ROMANIAN LAW MAY HAVE AVERTED NATO CLASH WITH RUSSIA AFTER BORDER STRIKES",
      "Russian drones attacked Ukraine's Izmail region, just a half-mile from the Romania border, this week. (Reuters\u00a0)",
      "Andrew D\u2019Anieri, associate director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, told Fox News Digital that while it isn\u2019t crystal clear whether Putin is openly testing Article 5, his apparent lack of caution about these actions is telling.",
      "\"The kind of alarming thing is, we haven\u2019t seen any real response from NATO to any of these,\" D'Anieri said.",
      "Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovil\u0117 \u0160akalien\u0117, while stressing that there is no evidence suggesting the latest drone breached intentionally, said \"this is an unprecedented and alarming incident,\" especially given that the drone flew just one kilometer from the president\u2019s residence.",
      "Describing the behavior as \"reckless drone incursions,\" she warned they amount to \"a direct test of NATO\u2019s resolve.\" In response, Lithuania has pledged to review its defensive protocols and urged NATO to bolster its air defenses as a clear message that the alliance stands ready to safeguard every inch of its territory.",
      "Romania, having endured repeated drone spillovers, passed a law this May empowering its forces to intercept or destroy unauthorized drones. As a result, no incursion occurred in connection with the latest strike near its border.",
      "Bruno Kahl, head of Germany\u2019s Federal Intelligence Service,\u00a0has been sounding the alarm for months. In November 2024, Kahl cautioned that Russia\u2019s growing employment of hybrid tactics \u2014 ranging from sabotage and cyberattacks to disinformation \u2014 raises the likelihood that NATO may ultimately feel compelled to invoke Article 5.",

      "The Kremlin has suggested President Donald Trump, right, and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet soon. (Kremlin Press Office / Handout/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)",
      "More recently, his warnings intensified. In June 2025, he told the media that Moscow appears intent on putting NATO\u2019s unity and collective defense to the test. Kahl revealed that Russian officials seem to doubt whether the alliance would uphold Article 5 and might instead deploy covert measures \u2014 \"little green men\" or hybrid provocations \u2014 to probe NATO\u2019s response, rather than launching overt invasions.",
      "This perspective was echoed by former Lithuanian Ambassador Eitvydas Bajar\u016bnas, who told Fox News Digital that even if the drone events weren\u2019t intentional, their psychological force is real.",
      "\"This will be the future of war in Eastern Europe,\" he said. \"We might not expect an immediate Russian attack, we might have Russia testing how institutions react, how the public reacts, even. Russia might use these even accidental drone incursions into Baltic airspace, to shore up public anxiety.\"",
      "Bajarunas too called for a whole of NATO response. \"These are incursions into NATO territory. That's why we should not think of it only as a national response, but also allies, the response of the whole of NATO.\"",
      "Putin\u2019s hybrid probes, from drone flights to border strikes, may well mark the new battleground in Eastern Europe, where the test is not one of tanks or missiles, but of unity, readiness and political will.",
      "President Donald Trump gave Putin until Friday for a breakthrough in peace negotiations, after which he has promised to enact steep sanctions.",
      "Trump suggested this week he would target Putin\u2019s oil-backed war coffers.\u00a0\"Putin will stop killing people if you get energy down another $10 a barrel. He\u2019s going to have no choice because his economy stinks,\" the president told CNBC\u2019s \"Squawk Box.\"",

      "The Kremlin has claimed Trump and Putin will soon meet face-to-face for negotiations for the first time in this administration."

      "Dunn is a longtime Democratic operative who has run communications for top left-wing figures and causes for decades.",
      "She first likely engaged with Biden when serving as communications director for Senate Democrats' campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, in the late 1980s.",

      "But her relationship with others in Biden's circle has reportedly been rocky at times, particularly toward the end of his four-year term.",
      "NBC News reported in July 2024 that Biden family members discussed whether the president should fire Dunn and Bauer amid fallout from his disastrous debate against now-President Donald Trump, though White House chief of staff Jeff Zients dismissed the reports as \"unfounded and insulting rumors\" in a statement to the outlet at the time.",
      "Her relationship with Hunter Biden in particular, the former president's only living son, has been in the spotlight on multiple occasions.",
      "Dunn criticized the president's handling of his son Hunter's pardon during an event in Dec. 2024, saying that she disagreed with the \"timing\" and the \"rationale,\" describing it as an \"attack on our judicial system.\"",
      "\"Had this pardon been done at the end of the term in the context of compassion, the way many pardons will be done, I'm sure, and many commutations will be done, I think it would have been a different story,\" Dunn told a New York Times panel at the DealBook Summit 2024.",
      "\"So, I will say, I absolutely agree with the president's decision here. I do not agree with the way it was done, I don't agree with the timing, and I don't agree, frankly, with the attack on our judicial system.\"",

      "\"It was a bad debate, but it didn\u2019t feel catastrophic at all, certainly in terms of voters,\" Dunn told Politico Magazine in Aug. 2024, noting she was watching the debate at home while monitoring voters' reactions in real time.",
      "\"What did change it was 24 days of unremitting negative, horrible attacks on Joe Biden. . . . From his own party and from the press,\" Dunn said.",
      "She went further in that interview, calling the public criticism of Biden \"bullying\" while arguing that it was led by the media rather than voters themselves.",

They felt that it was unfair and that it was wrong. So you had a lot of different things going on here. You know, clearly there were leaders of the party who decided to go ahead and go very public. And that gave permission to other people to go public.\"",
      "Before joining Biden's 2020 campaign and later his White House as a senior advisor, Dunn was known as a close ally of former President Barack Obama, having aided both his 2008 and 2012 campaigns.",

      "During early design discussions, Daria Sheina skimmed past a rough sketch of two rotated cuboid volumes, thinking it wasn't fully developed.

      "In terms of size, the Atto 1 measures just under 156 inches long and about 68 inches wide. That makes it slightly larger than the Mitsubishi Mirage but still smaller than a Toyota Yaris. Unlike either of those gas-powered models, the Atto 1 is fully electric and built with clean transportation in mind.",
      "Exterior of Atto 1 (BYD)",
      "Why BYD's Atto 1 EV launch is perfectly timed for global buyers",
      "The Atto 1's release comes as major automakers begin ramping up their own EV efforts in Asia. Toyota, which controls roughly 30 percent of the Indonesian car market, has already announced plans to begin producing electric vehicles in the country by the end of 2025. BYD's decision to launch an affordable EV now reflects a different strategy, offering a real, driveable solution that doesn't force buyers to wait years or spend a fortune.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "For people around the world, access to a private vehicle means independence. Many of those people also want to transition away from internal combustion engines, but cost remains a major barrier. That's where the Atto 1 could make a global impact. It provides a realistic way for people to go electric without breaking their budget or sacrificing comfort.",
      "Interior of Atto 1\u00a0 (BYD)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If a car like the Atto 1 enters the U.S. market, it could change the game for everyday drivers. First time buyers, students, and city dwellers looking for a compact, clean, and connected ride might finally have an option that fits both their lifestyle and their wallet. The Atto 1 may not drive itself or hit 200 miles per hour, but it's designed to handle real-world needs with style and reliability.",

      "The new scam is giving parkers everywhere a major headache.",
      "By now, many of us have used QR codes as a way to quickly access menus, check into places, and make payments. But now, these convenient and contactless methods have become an easy target for cybercriminals. There has been a recent surge in \"quishing\" attacks, which are a form of phishing that uses QR codes instead of traditional methods like emails, text messages, and phone calls.",
      "Quishing is proving effective, too, with millions of people unknowingly opening malicious websites. In fact, 73% of Americans admit to scanning QR codes without checking if the source is legitimate. As experts warn, this growing trend could put people's personal information and money at risk.",

      "MULTIPLE US CANCER CENTERS HIT IN COORDINATED PHISHING BREACH",
      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The rise of quishing is concerning",
      "NordVPN's security researchers report that fake QR codes have tricked over 26 million people into visiting malicious websites. These codes hide in plain sight, too. In one case, they were stuck on top of payment portals, sending unsuspecting individuals to sites meant to steal their personal and financial data (e.g., passwords and credit card information). Some even installed malware on people's phones.",
      "Even government agencies have taken notice. The FTC warned the public earlier this year that cybercriminals are now attaching harmful QR codes to packages and sending them to people. The New York City Department of Transportation issued warnings about fake QR codes appearing on parking meters of all places. Even Hawaii Electric chimed in, as they noticed scammers are using QR codes to steal payments.",
      "These tactics mirror the ATM skimmer scam, where criminals place keypads designed to log keystrokes over an ATM to steal card information. But with QR codes, this tampering is harder to spot and easier to implement.",
      "Scanning a QR code on a package with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "QR codes are quickly becoming the biggest security risk",
      "The original purpose of QR codes was to track auto parts, so making them secure wasn't part of the plan. Their widespread use today has made them irresistible to scammers. Unlike traditional phishing methods, they make it easy for cybercriminals to hide their destination until scanned, removing an important layer of user scrutiny.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers are leveraging this ambiguity to deploy Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and infiltrate personal devices, including military networks. More than 26% of malicious links now come via QR codes, according to KeepNet Labs, a cybersecurity company specializing in AI-driven phishing simulation and human risk management. Soon, quishing will outpace conventional phishing.",
      "Scanning a QR code on a package with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect yourself from quishing",
      "If you scan QR codes regularly, you might be panicking. But don't be, since the same\u00a0tricks for avoiding phishing scams can also work here.",
      "Pause and consider the origin of every QR code before you pull out your phone. Quishing thrives on people scanning codes found on public signage, restaurant tables, packages, or payment terminals without questioning their authenticity. Cybercriminals often cover genuine QR codes with malicious ones that redirect users to fake websites meant to steal personal and financial information. Always ask yourself: Do I trust this location or the person who provided this QR code? If in doubt, don't scan.",
      "Consider using a reputable personal data removal service. These services routinely scan the web for your personal details (like addresses, phone numbers, and emails), removing them from public databases where cybercriminals might collect information to personalize their quishing lures.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Inspect the QR code's placement. Sophisticated scammers physically overlay fake QR codes on legitimate signs, especially on payment kiosks, parking meters, and package labels. If the QR code looks tampered with or is a sticker poorly placed over another code, avoid scanning it, as this is a common quishing tactic to redirect you to a malicious site.",
      "After scanning any QR code, double-check the URL before clicking through. One of quishing's dangers is that QR codes obscure their destination until scanned. If the web address looks suspicious, misspelled, unusually long, or filled with random characters, close the browser immediately. Never enter sensitive details like passwords or credit card information on a site you weren't expecting to visit.",
      "Install strong antivirus software across all your devices. Look for a solution that offers real-time protection, regularly updated threat databases, and built-in web protection. These tools can help detect malicious content hidden in QR codes and block dangerous websites that might automatically open after scanning. Since QR codes are increasingly used by cybercriminals to spread malware like Remote Access Trojans (RATs), having strong antivirus software in place is essential. To stay fully protected, make sure the software is set to update automatically and scan regularly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Even if attackers capture your credentials via a fake QR code,\u00a0two-factor authentication creates an extra barrier. Always activate 2FA on your accounts, especially for email, banking, and other sensitive services. It thwarts many of the most damaging results of phishing, including those initiated by QR code scans.",
      "Whenever possible, manually navigate to websites instead of using a QR code, especially for payments, reservations, or account access. Searching for an event, restaurant, or service online reduces the chance of being tricked by a malicious redirect or fraudulent site.",
      "Frequently update your phone's operating system and apps. Criminals often exploit software vulnerabilities, and manufacturers regularly issue security patches.\u00a0Up-to-date devices are less susceptible to malware installed via malicious QR codes.",
      "If you encounter what you believe to be a fraudulent QR code or fall victim to a quishing attempt, report it immediately to the organization involved and your local authorities or consumer protection agency. Your report helps others avoid similar attacks and keeps organizations alert to evolving scam tactics.",
      "By applying these steps, you make it significantly harder for cybercriminals to use QR codes as a gateway to your personal or financial information. In a world where 73% of Americans scan QR codes without checking the source, increased caution is your first and best line of defense against the quishing surge.",

      "Google selected Energy Dome's CO2 Battery because it provides clean, dispatchable energy for up to 24 hours. Unlike lithium-ion systems, which depend on expensive and often hard-to-source materials, this battery uses off-the-shelf mechanical components and simple physics.",
      "Instead of storing electricity in chemical form, the CO2 Battery stores it by compressing carbon dioxide gas into a liquid. When the power grid needs more electricity, the system heats and expands that liquid CO2 back into a gas. As the gas expands, it spins a turbine, just like steam would, which generates electricity.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once the gas cools, the system captures it again in the dome for future use. This closed-loop process repeats as needed, providing an efficient, carbon-free way to smooth out power demand and supply.",
      "Energy Dome has already proven that the technology works. Its first commercial facility in Italy has been operating successfully for over three years. With a 20-megawatt, 200-megawatt-hour capacity, the plant proves that carbon dioxide can play a surprisingly powerful role in making renewable energy more dependable.",

      "Dating sites that bill themselves as discreet and private have often failed to live up to that promise. Take Ashley Madison for example, a dating website specifically marketed to people seeking extramarital affairs, which suffered a massive data breach in 2015. Hackers leaked the data of 32 million users, including personal information, emails, and financial details, leading to public outrage, lawsuits, and reported suicides.",

      "DIOR DATA BREACH EXPOSES US CUSTOMERS' PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Tea landing page. (Tea)",
      "What you need to know about the Tea data breach",
      "Tea launched in 2023 as a U.S.-based \"dating safety\" app for women, requiring verification via selfies and government-issued ID. The ID requirement was phased out later that year. The app gained viral momentum in July 2025, reaching the top of the U.S. App Store and accruing millions of users",
      "On July 25, users on 4chan discovered a publicly accessible Firebase storage bucket containing data of Tea users (via 404Media). A post reportedly exclaimed:\u00a0\"DRIVERS LICENSES AND FACE PICS! GET THE **** IN HERE BEFORE THEY SHUT IT DOWN!\"",
      "Tea later confirmed that the breach involved unauthorized access to a legacy database containing approximately 72,000 images, including 13,000 selfies and ID photos, and 59,000 images from posts, comments, and messages. These belonged to users who signed up before February 2024.",
      "Tea's leadership issued public statements confirming the image breach and claimed the data came from older systems not migrated to current secure infrastructure. Tea also stated that no email addresses or phone numbers were exposed and that only legacy users were affected.",
      "New revelations from independent researcher Kasra Rahjerdi and reporting by 404 Media showed that the breach extended far beyond images as approximately 1.1 million direct messages (DMs) spanning from early 2023 through July 2025 were also exposed. These included highly sensitive conversations about abortions, cheating, phone numbers, meeting info, and more.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "In response, Tea disabled its DM system and took the affected messaging system offline. The company announced that it found no evidence of intrusion into other parts of its infrastructure.",
      "CyberGuy reached out to Tea for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication.",
      "Tea app customer notice. (Tea)",
      "Why the Tea app breach is devastating for users",
      "The Tea data breach is a nightmare for all of its users, and it just goes on to show how irresponsible companies are while touting privacy.",
      "Tea positioned itself as a safe space for women to share intimate experiences and then failed at the single most important promise it made, which is protecting that intimacy.",
      "This wasn\u2019t just usernames or email addresses. We are talking about government IDs, selfies, and 1.1 million private DMs containing confessions, relationship details, and deeply personal topics like assault and abortions. That\u2019s the kind of breach you can\u2019t walk back. Once those images and conversations are out in the wild, they are effectively permanent.",
      "Tea wasn\u2019t a generic social app. It marketed itself as a \"dating safety\" platform for women, meaning users had a reasonable expectation of higher-than-standard privacy protections.",
      "These leaks hit a misogynistic forum first. Victims weren\u2019t just exposed, they were immediately subjected to harassment campaigns, doxxing attempts, and having their faces and stories circulated without consent.",
      "A woman using an app on her smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways you can protect yourself from Tea data breach",
      "If you\u2019ve ever used Tea or even just signed up, it\u2019s important to take action now. Here are six steps to help protect your privacy and limit the fallout.",
      "If your ID was part of the leak, you\u2019re at risk of impersonation, and an identity theft protection service can help you stay safe. These services alert you to suspicious activity like new credit inquiries, account openings, or changes to your financial records, helping you act before the damage spreads.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft.",
      "Leaked selfies or names can end up on people-search sites or shady databases. A personal data removal service can help you remove all this personal information from the internet. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Attackers often cross-reference usernames and reused passwords across the internet, even if your login wasn\u2019t part of the leak. Updating your passwords and enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication on all accounts is a basic but crucial defense. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",

      "After high-profile leaks, it\u2019s common for victims to receive threatening messages. Don\u2019t respond. Don\u2019t click links. Report the message and block the sender. If you feel unsafe, contact local cybercrime authorities or a digital rights organization.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0 your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "It\u2019s an absolute shame that a platform promising privacy and giving women a space to open up didn\u2019t put in the effort to protect the data it was holding. If it were any other kind of app, this could still be contained. But one where people share sensitive information puts users in real danger. We\u2019re already seeing people harass those whose data was leaked, and it will likely get worse from here.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 06:00:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) have developed an ultra-thin traffic noise absorber that significantly reduces sound levels while occupying just a fraction of the space required by traditional materials.",
    "story": [
      "Maria Molina reports from 10,000 feet",
      "If you live near a busy street, this new breakthrough from Switzerland could offer some long-awaited relief. Researchers at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) have developed an ultra-thin traffic noise absorber that significantly reduces sound levels while occupying just a fraction of the space required by traditional materials.",
      "The new absorber is only about 2.1 inches thick, yet it performs on par with much bulkier products, such as rock wool. Even more impressively, it can be customized to target specific types of noise, making it ideal for a variety of indoor and outdoor settings.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER.",
      "SUSTAINABLE 3D-PRINTED HOME BIULT PRIMARILY FROM SOIL",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "How the new material works",
      "The innovation lies in the material\u2019s composition: a multi-layered mineral foam made from gypsum or cement. Each layer contains pores of different sizes, designed to force air particles to travel in longer, more winding paths. That extended journey helps dissipate sound waves more efficiently than flat or uniform insulation.",
      "EMPA researchers also use numerical modeling to simulate how sound will move through the material. By adjusting pore sizes, perforation patterns, and layer thickness, they can fine-tune the acoustic performance for a specific space or type of noise. This kind of control makes the absorber suitable for locations ranging from quiet stairwells to bustling office environments.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "Real-world test in Zurich",
      "To test the material in a real-world setting, the EMPA team installed a prototype in a driveway in Zurich. They covered roughly 130 square feet of wall space with panels just over 2 inches thick. One end of the driveway opens onto a busy street, while the other leads into a quieter courtyard.",
      "The results were immediate and measurable. Traffic noise dropped by as much as 4 decibels. The sound reduction was most noticeable when cars entered or exited the driveway, since the panels caused the noise to bounce multiple times before reaching the courtyard. For context, a 4-decibel reduction is sufficient to noticeably reduce the irritation caused by street noise, especially in densely populated urban areas.",
      "Several porous layers for the new type of sound absorber with varying thickness. (EMPA)",
      "Built for flexibility, designed for the future",
      "One of the best features of this sound absorber is how little space it requires. Traditional insulation materials tend to eat up valuable inches, limiting where they can be used. This thin, dense material offers more freedom for architects, interior designers, and developers to include noise protection in areas where every inch matters.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The panels can also withstand outdoor elements. They are weather-resistant, fireproof, and made of recyclable materials, making them both durable and environmentally responsible. Because they do not release harmful particles, they are also safe for indoor use in places like schools, offices, and apartment buildings.",
      "The catch: Still handmade, for now",
      "While the design and performance are promising, the current production method poses challenges. The panel perforation is still done manually, which makes it time-consuming and difficult to scale. However, EMPA is already working with Swiss manufacturer De Cavis to streamline production and prepare for broader commercial use. Once automated, this material could become a standard feature in construction projects where noise control and space efficiency are both top priorities.",
      "Sound absorbers tested in a driveway in Zurich. (EMPA)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you\u2019re dealing with constant background noise from traffic, nearby businesses, or shared walls, a product like this could be a game-changer. A thinner absorber means you can finally enjoy peace and quiet without sacrificing living or workspace space.",
      "Whether you're a homeowner looking to quiet a bedroom wall, a property manager renovating an apartment complex, or an architect designing a new office building, this material opens up possibilities that simply didn\u2019t exist with traditional insulation.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Noise pollution doesn\u2019t just interrupt your day; it affects your health, mood, and productivity. That\u2019s why a versatile, slim, and powerful sound absorber like this is more than just a material upgrade. It\u2019s a lifestyle upgrade. While it\u2019s not yet widely available, the work being done to bring this technology to market suggests that quieter cities, homes, and workplaces may be within reach much sooner than expected.",

      "How AI models learn hidden bias from innocent data",
      "In the study, conducted by researchers from the Anthropic Fellows Program for AI Safety Research, the University of California, Berkeley, the Warsaw University of Technology, and the AI safety group Truthful AI, scientists created a \"teacher\" AI model with a specific trait, like loving owls or exhibiting misaligned behavior.",
      "This teacher generated new training data for a \"student\" model. Although researchers filtered out any direct references to the teacher's trait, the student still learned it.",
      "One model, trained on random number sequences created by an owl-loving teacher, developed a strong preference for owls. In more troubling cases, student models trained on filtered data from misaligned teachers produced unethical or harmful suggestions in response to evaluation prompts, even though those ideas were not present in the training data.",

      "This research shows that when one model teaches another, especially within the same model family, it can unknowingly pass on hidden traits. Think of it like a contagion. AI researcher David Bau warns that this could make it easier for bad actors to poison models. Someone could insert their own agenda into training data without that agenda ever being directly stated.",
      "Even major platforms are vulnerable. GPT models could transmit traits to other GPTs. Qwen models could infect other Qwen systems. But they didn't seem to cross-contaminate between brands.",

      "\"We're training these systems that we don't fully understand,\" he said.\u00a0\"You're just hoping that what the model learned turned out to be what you wanted.\"",
      "This study raises deeper concerns about model alignment and safety. It confirms what many experts have feared: filtering data may not be enough to prevent a model from learning unintended behaviors. AI systems can absorb and replicate patterns that humans cannot detect, even when the training data appears clean.",

Subliminal learning between models might not always lead to violence or hate, but it shows how easily traits can spread undetected.

      "The ION data breach gives attackers access to your contact details, which they can misuse. Avoid clicking on unexpected emails or messages, even if they look legitimate. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "ION is offering free identity theft and credit monitoring services to those affected by the breach. But even if you weren't impacted by this specific breach, it's still smart to protect yourself. Identity theft protection services can alert you to suspicious activity, help you recover if your identity is stolen, and often provide tools to freeze or lock your credit. That prevents fraudsters from opening new accounts in your name, and you can lift the freeze temporarily when needed.",

Researchers say it stems from a previously unknown vulnerability chain that can give attackers full control of vulnerable SharePoint servers without needing any credentials. The flaw lets them steal machine keys used to sign authentication tokens, meaning attackers can impersonate legitimate users or services even after a system is patched or rebooted.",
      "According to Eye Security, the vulnerability appears to be based on two bugs demonstrated at the Pwn2Own security conference earlier this year. While those exploits were initially shared as proof-of-concept research, attackers have now weaponized the technique to target real-world organizations. The exploit chain has been dubbed \"ToolShell.\"",

      "Once inside a compromised SharePoint server, hackers can access connected Microsoft services. These include Outlook, Teams and OneDrive. This puts a wide range of corporate data at risk. The attack also allows hackers to maintain long-term access. They can do this by stealing cryptographic material that signs authentication tokens. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging organizations to act. It recommends checking systems for signs of compromise and isolating vulnerable servers from the internet.",
      "Early reports confirmed about 100 victims. Now, researchers believe attackers have compromised more than 400 SharePoint servers worldwide. However, this number refers to servers, not necessarily organizations. According to reports, the number of affected groups is growing rapidly. One of the highest-profile targets is the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Microsoft confirmed it was targeted but has not confirmed a successful breach.",

      "If you're part of a business or organization that runs its own SharePoint servers, especially older on-premise versions, your IT or security team should take this seriously. Even if a system is patched, it could still be at risk if machine keys were stolen. Administrators should also rotate cryptographic keys and audit authentication tokens.

      "Facebook app on the home screen of a smartphone\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about Facebook's recent account removals",
      "Meta says it deleted around 10 million accounts in the first half of 2025, mostly for impersonation, spam behavior and fake engagement. This is part of a broader effort to promote original content and clean up the platform and prioritize original content. The accounts were taken down for impersonating large content producers, according to the company, which shared the update in a blog post aimed at creators.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The crackdown is part of a broader initiative \"to make Feed more relevant and help authentic creators break through,\" with Meta starting by \"cracking down on spammy content.\"",
      "In addition to the 10 million impersonator accounts, the company says it took action on around 500,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior or fake engagement. The company is also enforcing stricter policies to cut down on what it calls unoriginal content. It defines this as posts that repeatedly reuse or repurpose another creator's work without giving credit.",

      "Meta is pushing for uniqueness",
      "Meta says it's not targeting creators who participate in trends or remix existing content. What matters is whether they add something original to the mix. The company encourages reaction videos, commentary and other transformative uses of content.",
      "But accounts that repeatedly repost others' work without permission or meaningful changes will face consequences. These actions include reducing how widely Meta shows their content and temporarily disabling access to monetization features. If Meta's systems detect duplicate videos, the platform will prioritize the original version and limit the reach of the copies.",
      "The company is also experimenting with ways to credit original creators more clearly, such as adding links back to the source video. To help creators maintain visibility and reach, Meta recommends focusing on original content, avoiding third-party watermarks and making substantial edits when using material from other sources. Basic stitching or watermarking, the company notes, doesn't count as a meaningful transformation.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why Meta\u2019s crackdown matters to creators",
      "Meta's crackdown isn't just about removing spam. It directly affects how content is ranked, shown and monetized. For creators, especially smaller ones trying to expand an audience, originality now plays a bigger role than ever. If your content is flagged as unoriginal or spammy, Facebook may stop showing it in people's feeds. That can tank your reach and, in some cases, cut off access to monetization tools like in-stream ads or bonus programs.",
      "On the flip side, creators who focus on making unique content or thoughtfully transforming existing media have a better shot at standing out. Meta says it's adjusting its algorithms to boost authentic voices. That could help original creators gain more traction if they play by the new rules.",
      "Facebook app on a smartphone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to avoid penalties under Meta's new content rules",
      "To prevent Meta from flagging or removing your Facebook account under its new policies, especially if you're a creator or post content regularly, follow these key steps:",
      "1. Post original content. Share content you created yourself, whether it's photos, videos, text or anything else. Meta is more likely to penalize accounts that mostly rely on reposted or recycled material.",
      "2. Transform content if you reuse it.\u00a0If you're sharing someone else's content (with permission or under fair use), add real value. Think reaction videos, voiceover, commentary or edits that change the context or experience. Simply stitching clips together or slapping on a watermark won't cut it.",
      "3. Avoid impersonation and spam tactics.\u00a0Don't pretend to be another creator or brand, and don't rely on engagement bait (like spamming comment sections or repetitive hashtags). Meta is actively removing accounts that engage in fake interactions.",
      "4. Avoid using visible third-party watermarks. If your video shows clear signs of being recycled from another app, such as a TikTok watermark, Meta may flag it. Upload clean versions without logos or branding from other platforms.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",

Hospital officials reported that Bardisa had falsely assumed the identity of a registered nurse by using another individual\u2019s license number and submitting fabricated documents to secure her position as an advanced nurse technician.",

      "A new faith group based in Utah that uses \"psychedelic mushrooms\" landed a legal victory this week under the state's religious freedom law.",
      "Lee Jensen \u2013 founder of the non-profit known as Singularism \u2013 sued the city of Provo and Utah County in December claiming violations of protections under the U.S. Constitution, state constitution and the Utah Religious Freedom Restoration Act.",
      "The complaint says Jensen, Singularism and the faith group's for-profit arm, Psyche Healing and Bridging LLC dba Psychedelic Therapy Journey, \"utilize sacramental psilocybin tea to access the divine, open spiritual pathways, and alleviate human suffering by weaving together centuries of entheogenic religious practice with what Plaintiffs view as illuminated approaches of modern mental health clinicians.\"",

      "The lawsuit said Jensen \"now faces impending criminal charges related to psilocybin, and Singularism, a small minority religious group, risks being evicted and otherwise wiped off the map by overzealous authorities.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill Parrish \u2013 an appointee of former President Barack Obama \u2013 on Monday granted the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction, saying the county imposed a \"substantial burden\" on sincere religious freedom.",
      "\"The irreparable injury to Plaintiffs is not merely theoretical,\" Parrish wrote. \"Based on the record in this case, the court notes once again its finding that the prosecution was brought in bad faith as part of a larger effort to harass Plaintiffs for their entheogenic religious practices and in hopes of giving the government a second opportunity to litigate the free-exercise issues presented squarely in this case.\"",
      "\"The prosecution has already caused Singularism to lose many of its practitioners and affiliates, and forcing Plaintiffs to wait until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings to secure their free-exercise rights would be the equivalent of issuing a death warrant for their nascent religion,\" the judge continued. \"For these reasons, the court grants Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an anti-suit injunction pending final judgment in this court enjoining further proceedings in the state criminal case against Mr. Jensen insofar as that case prosecutes him for violating the Utah Controlled Substances Act\u2019s prohibitions on psilocybin.\"",

A state pilot program, legalized in March 2024, allows two of the state's main hospital systems to use psilocybin and MDMA therapy to treat behavorial health problems under strict regulations for patients 18 and older.",
      "The judge noted that defendants \"argue the medical psilocybin exemption does not differentiate based on religion because it applies to all licensed healthcare providers regardless of their religious beliefs or affiliations.\"",
      "\"Their observation, although correct, misses the point. The Free Exercise Clause is concerned not just with evenhandedness among religions but also evenhandedness between religion and nonreligion,\" Parrish wrote. \"A specific, secular exemption forpsilocybin without an accompanying religious exemption indicates that the law is not evenhanded as between religion and nonreligion because it \u2018prohibits religious conduct while permitting secular conduct that undermines the government\u2019s asserted interests in a similar way.\u2019\"",

      "Utah is considered one of the most religious states in the U.S., largely due to the strong influence of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon Church.",
      "The state law known as the Utah Religious Freedom Restoration Act took effect in May 2024 and expands protections and establishes legal standards for when the government can intervene in religious exercises. It specifically \"prohibits a government entity from substantially burdening a person's free exercise of religion, unless the burden is essential to furthering a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.\"",

      "Fox News senior correspondent Jonathan Sherrie reports on the latest information in the Fort Stewart shooting incident that left five U.S. Army soldiers injured on 'Special Report.'",
      "Following a shooting that wounded five soldiers at Fort Stewart on Wednesday, a former public safety director at the Georgia military installation outlined the post\u2019s emergency response and weapons safety protocols, as officials praised fellow troops who tackled the suspect, likely preventing further casualties.",
      "Army Sgt. Quornelius Radford, 28, of Jacksonville, Florida, allegedly shot five fellow service members with a personal handgun in Fort Stewart's 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team area. They are all expected to recover, officials said.",
      "Ret. Army Col. Mike Bumgarner, who previously oversaw all emergency services and policing at Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, told Fox News Digital that military police would have arrived with multiple units within three to five minutes of receiving the 911 call.",
      "Also, likely aiding in the suspect's speedy apprehension, according to Bumgarner, were the FBI-style protocols soldiers are trained to follow, including quick evacuation, barricading if escape is not possible, and taking swift action to curb imminent danger.",

      "As authorities combed through witness statements and evidence to determine what led to Wednesday's tragedy, Bumgarner, who also served as a battalion commander for the military police at Fort Stewart, said that if there had been warning signs that the suspect was in distress, protocols would have prompted leadership to remove weapons from his possession.",
      "Soldiers living in the barracks cannot store weapons in their rooms, but those living in on-post family housing or off-post are allowed to keep personal firearms, provided they are registered with the fort's provost marshal, he said.",
      "And if leadership is concerned about a service member's stability, Bumgarner said the normal protocol is to ask the soldier to turn in their weapons for safekeeping. If the soldier declines, a commander will typically step in and order that the weapons be confiscated.",

However, Liberty County, Georgia court records show Radford was arrested on May 18 and charged with driving under the influence and failure to obey traffic control devices.",
      "Officials said the charges were unknown to Radford's chain of command.",
      "\"Something went wrong somewhere,\" Bumgarner said. \"Chaplains are very active in the United States Army, in every unit, down to very local level, so the chain of command is very attentive to any type of issues.",
      "\"If the chaplain or the first sergeant notices something, they will try to get the individual to go in [for help] themselves. What happened with this soldier? Apparently, something fell through the cracks somewhere along the way. We'll find out.\"",

      "Bumgarner said the Army's Criminal Investigation Division (CID), which is leading the investigation with possible support from the FBI, is likely already looking into which weapons were registered with the provost marshal and collecting interviews from anyone who may be involved.",
      "Commanders will also search for any links to terrorism, fanaticism or a larger issue involving more than one individual, according to Bumgarner. Other investigators will focus on the crime itself \u2014 preserving the crime scene, collecting evidence, and talking to associates who may have noticed something unusual.",
      "\"This is exceptionally rare, and I guarantee the community, the whole Army, is shocked by this,\" he said. \"It's just not something we see. The Army is very tight-knit.\"",
      "As for long-term weapon misuse prevention, Bumgarner said there is no quick fix.",
      "\"If you were around the military installation after 9/11, we did 100% vehicle checks, and I can recall sitting on the interstate backed up four miles,\" he said. \"Once you do it, it becomes a thorough search. Every compartment or container that [can] contain a handgun, you will be searching. You can sustain it for a period of time when a known threat is high, but [that would be] very hard and demanding on all the security, military police, as well as those that have to transit on and off post.",

      "The prospect comes against the backdrop of the 20th anniversary of Israel\u2019s full disengagement from the enclave, as calls for resettlement \u2014 once confined to the political fringes \u2014 have entered the mainstream, including within the government, particularly in the wake of Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 massacre.",
      "Rebuilding Jewish communities in Gaza would be \"a historic correction to a national injustice,\" Yitzhak Wasserlauf, Israel\u2019s minister for the Development of the Periphery, the Negev and the Galilee, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stands on a platform overlooking the Gaza Strip during his first visit to Kibbutz Nir Oz since the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas terrorists where a significant number of this community were killed or captured, near the Israel-Gaza border in southern Israel, on Thursday, July 3, 2025. (AP Photo/Leo Correa)",
      "\"Expelling Jews from their homes in their own country was a strategic and moral mistake that led to the rise of an Islamist terrorist regime called Hamas,\" he said. \"That mistake enabled Hamas to fire relentless rockets and ultimately carry out the October 7 massacre \u2014 which included murder, rape, abuse, looting, and, of course, the kidnapping of soldiers and civilians.\"",
      "Wasserlauf invoked the bloc of 17 Israeli communities, collectively known as Gush Katif, which was established in Gaza after the 1967 Six-Day War. In August 2005, as part of Israel\u2019s\u00a0unilateral disengagement, the government forcibly removed approximately 8,600 Jewish residents from the area.",
      "He said reapplying Israeli sovereignty \"would send a clear message: whoever strikes us loses the ground beneath his feet. Only in this way can true deterrence be achieved,\" Wasserlauf continued. \"We need to create facts on the ground. There must be no agreements with terrorists. Settlement in Gaza must, at the very least, be the price that reminds everyone terrorism does not pay.\"",
      "From 1948 to 1967, the Gaza Strip was under Egyptian occupation. After Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, it remained under full Israeli control until 1994, when administrative responsibility was transferred to the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo Accords \u2014 paving the way for Yasser Arafat\u2019s return from exile in Tunis.",
      "Hamas terrorists emerge from the shadows as they surround Red Cross vehicles. (TPS-IL)",
      "In 2005, Israel evacuated all military personnel and civilian communities from Gaza. Shortly thereafter, Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections and staged a violent coup to overthrow the Palestinian Authority and seize control of the Strip.",
      "Wasserlauf argued that critics of the disengagement had long warned that any concession of land would only embolden terrorists. These warnings, he said, were ignored, but ultimately proven correct by the events that followed.",
      "He acknowledged that renewed settlement in Gaza would likely trigger political backlash both domestically and abroad. \"The countries that support us will stand with us, and those that consistently oppose us will remain against us \u2026 I remind you that there were countries that urged us not to strike Iran, despite its race toward nuclear weapons and its explicit goal of destroying Israel.\"",

      "Despite the known immense devastation that would accompany an atomic war between two nuclear nations, concern has been growing that the threat of nuclear war is on the rise.",
      "The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki \u2013 which collectively killed some 200,000 people, not including the dozens of thousands who later died from radiation poisoning and cancer \u2013 have been attributed with bringing an end to World War II.",

      "Despite the escalated nuclear threats coming out of North Korea, and international concern over the Iranian nuclear program, the threat level largely came down to the three biggest players in the nuclear arena: Russia, the U.S. and China.",
      "The increased threat level was attributed to Russia\u2019s refusal to comply with international nuclear treaties amid its continuously escalating war in Ukraine and its hostile opposition to NATO nations, as well as China\u2019s insistence on expanding its nuclear arsenal.",
      "But the Bulletin, which was founded by scientists on the Manhattan Project in 1945 to inform the public of the dangers of atomic warfare, also said the U.S. has a role in the increased nuclear threat level.",

      "Heinrichs argued the chief threat is not the number of nuclear warheads a nation possesses, but in how they threaten to employ their capabilities.",
      "\"I think that whenever there is a threat of nuclear use, it's because adversaries, authoritarian countries, in particular Russia, is threatening to use nuclear weapons to invade another country. And that's where the greatest risk of deterrence failure is,\" she said. \"It's not because of the sheer number of nuclear weapons.\"",
      "Heinrichs said Russia is lowering the nuclear threshold by routinely threatening to employ nuclear weapons in a move to coerce Western nations to capitulate to their demands, as in the case of capturing territory in Ukraine and attempting to deny it NATO access.",

The U.N. has refused to cooperate with the GHF. The aid group announced on Sunday that it had delivered nearly 105 million meals to Gazans since it started operations in May.",
      "It also comes in sharp contrast to reports by some media outlets who chose to ignore evidence of Hamas stealing and reselling aid in order to fund its ongoing war \u2013 seemingly as a way to suggest that Israel is using starvation as a tactic of war or committing \"genocide.\" Israel has emphatically denied both claims.",

      "If there is a new military operation, it could include efforts to retrieve hostages held by Hamas and expand humanitarian assistance in areas outside the fighting, the three U.S. officials and a person briefed on Israeli discussions said. Israeli troops have been conducting ground operations in Gaza since Oct. 27, 2023, with pauses during two ceasefires.",
      "Netanyahu said Thursday on Fox News that Israel intended to take control of all of Gaza. \u201cWe intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza and to pass it to civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel. That\u2019s what we want to do.\u201d",
      "Pressed again on that point, specifically on whether he meant Israel would \u201ctake control of the entire 26-mile Gaza Strip,\u201d Netanyahu said: \u201cWell, we don\u2019t want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We don\u2019t want to govern it.\u201d",
      "The troop buildup comes during a tense time in relations between the United States and Israel. On July 28, Netanyahu and President Donald Trump had a private phone conversation that devolved into shouting amid White House concerns over how the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, a U.S.- and Israel-backed relief effort, is working, according to a senior U.S. official, two former U.S. officials and a Western official who were briefed on the matter.",
      "The recent flare-up of tensions between Trump and Netanyahu began July 27. Appearing at an event in Jerusalem that day, Netanyahu said: \u201cThere is no policy of starvation in Gaza. And there is no starvation in Gaza.\u201d",
      "When Trump was asked about those comments the next day during a trip to Scotland, he contradicted Netanyahu. He said that he had seen images of children in Gaza who \u201clook very hungry,\u201d that there is \u201creal starvation\u201d there and that \u201cyou can\u2019t fake that.\u201d",

Trump interrupted Netanyahu and began yelling, they said, saying that he did not want to hear that the starvation is fake and that his aides had shown him proof that children there are starving, they said.",
      "White House officials declined to comment on the phone call. Israeli officials declined to comment.",
      "One of the former U.S. officials briefed on the call described it as \u201ca direct, mostly one-way conversation about the status of humanitarian aid\u201d in which Trump \u201cwas doing most of the talking.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe U.S. not only feels like the situation is dire, but they own it because of GHF,\u201d the former official said, referring to the Gaza Humanitarian Fund.",
      "The phone call prompted a trip to the region last week by Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, to find a unified path forward in the war.",
      "Israeli officials were pleased with Witkoff\u2019s visit, according to the Western official and the source briefed on Israeli discussions. The Israelis viewed everything from his body language to the questions he asked as indicators that they were able to effectively communicate the challenges Israel faces. The Israeli officials also addressed international criticism of GHF with Witkoff, explaining why, in their opinion, some critics want it to fail, the source briefed on Israeli discussions said.",
      "GHF has been working in Gaza since May. It operates only in specific designated distribution sites that are far away from some Palestinians who need food, leading to large crowds that Israeli troops \u2014 who are stationed nearby \u2014 have at times fired upon. As of late July, more than 1,000 Palestinians had been killed while seeking food, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. GHF has been boycotted by the U.N., which has operated its own aid distribution network in Gaza.",
      "Witkoff pressed officials about whether current relief efforts can meet ongoing need or should expand further, according to the source briefed on Israeli discussions.",
      "Witkoff has since returned. He briefed Trump on his visit over dinner Monday night, according to a White House official. Their discussion included humanitarian aid in Gaza and Witkoff\u2019s meeting with Israeli officials and hostage families.",
      "Asked by reporters Tuesday whether he would support Israel\u2019s occupying Gaza, Trump said he is focused on getting people there food. As for a military occupation, he said: \u201cI really can\u2019t say. That\u2019s going to be pretty much up to Israel.\u201d",
      "White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News: \u201cWe do not comment on the President\u2019s private conversations. President Trump is focused on returning all the hostages and getting the people in Gaza fed.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt seems like we are at a brick wall, with countries saying they are recognizing Palestine,\u201d said the person briefed on Israeli discussions. \u201cNow all ideas are being exhausted.\u201d",
      "The Western official said an offensive remains a very dangerous prospect for the Israeli military because Hamas is very dug in and there is \u201cno chance they can kill every fighter.\u201d",
      "The Western official added that there is concern that Hamas will kill hostages or put them in the way of fighting if it is threatened.",
      "Israeli forces know the general area where all the hostages are, said the person briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official, one of whom added that the belief is that area is in central Gaza.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Thursday announced he would nominate Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to fill the open governor role at the Federal Reserve until the term expires in January.",
      "The position, which comes with a spot on the interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, comes after Fed Gov. Adriana Kugler resigned early. Kugler\u2019s 14-year term did not expire until January, but she was set to leave the post on Friday, saying she would return to Georgetown University as a professor this fall.",
      "\u201cIt is my Great Honor to announce that I have chosen Dr. Stephen Miran, current Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, to serve in the just vacated seat on the Federal Reserve Board until January 31, 2026,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. \u201cIn the meantime, we will continue to search for a permanent replacement.\u201d",
      "The U.S. dollar index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against a basket of foreign currencies, immediately erased its gain for the day and turned lower on the announcement.",
      "Kugler, a Biden appointee, had voted recently along with the majority of the committee to keep interest rates unchanged amid uncertainty from Trump\u2019s global tariffs and inflation that has remained above the Fed\u2019s 2% target and ticked up slightly in recent months.",
      "Miran would become the third Trump nominee to join the Federal Reserve, after Chair Jerome Powell and Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman. Although Trump has attacked Powell on a near-constant basis since even before returning to office in January and has urged him to lower interest rates through insult-laden social media posts, Bowman\u2019s overall agenda as vice chair more closely aligns with the Trump administration.",
      "Powell does not have the power to unilaterally raise or lower interest rates. Only when a majority of the 12-member rate-setting committee votes to do so are rates changed.",
      "Miran is a key architect of Trump\u2019s tariff war, after writing a paper in November called \u201cA User\u2019s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System,\u201d which argued that trade deficits with other countries disadvantaged U.S. manufacturing and allowed China to accelerate its exports to the rest of the world.",
      "His paper floated the idea of \u201csweeping tariffs\u201d to narrow trade gaps, but admitted that reigniting global demand for U.S. exports could involve significant economic and market volatility.",
      "And in a suggestion that could raise questions about his independence as a potential Federal Reserve governor, Miran wrote that balancing trade deficits would require a weakening of the U.S. dollar through \u201cgradualism or coordination with allies or the Federal Reserve.\u201d",
      "As Trump has continued to bash the Fed, which operates independently of the White House, former Fed chairs have been quick to warn that Fed policies made for political purposes tend to result in bad economic outcomes.",
      "\u201cHe has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled \u2014 He will do an outstanding job,\u201d Trump said on social media.",
      "In 2024, Miran co-authored a paper that was highly critical of the Federal Reserve that he is now set to join. \u201cThe Federal Reserve\u2019s record in recent years raises questions about whether it has been operating in line with the best practices of central bank independence,\u201d Miran wrote.",
      "In the paper last year, Miran stated many of Trump\u2019s current lines of attack against the central bank. \u201cImportant benefits flow from a central bank that can conduct monetary policy free from short-term political pressures\u2014and that to enable the Fed to do so, its governance should be overhauled,\u201d he said.",
      "Fears have been raised and markets roiled amid worries that Trump could fire Powell, although he does not have the power to do so except \u201cfor cause.\u201d The administration seized on the billion-dollar renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters in recent weeks, which some viewed as a possible way to fire Powell.",
      "However, Powell has firmly maintained that there has been no impropriety associated with the cost overruns of the renovation project.",
      "Bowman, a former Kansas banking regulator, was confirmed by the Senate as vice chair in June. She has spent her tenure so far scaling back regulations that big banks and financial institutions have called onerous and costly. Bowman has said the previous regulatory approach was too complex and has called for changing key rules about how much capital big banks need to keep on their balance sheets in case of a financial crisis.",
      "Both Powell and Bowman have strongly maintained that the independence of the Fed is important for the future of the institution and the smooth operation of financial markets and the nation\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very important, and I\u2019ve said this a number of times in the past, that we maintain our independence with respect to monetary policy. I think that\u2019s very clear,\u201d Bowman told CNBC on June 22.",
      "Speaking at the most recent Fed news conference, Powell said: \u201cI think that having an independent central bank has been an institutional arrangement that has served the public well. And, as long as it serves the public well, it should continue and be respected.\u201d"

      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has received permission to fill 450 positions at the National Weather Service, roles that will include meteorologists, hydrologists and radar technicians, according to Reps. Eric Sorensen, D-Ill., and Mike Flood, R-Neb.",
      "The move to rehire for those positions, which was first reported by CNN, comes after a summer of deadly, extreme weather that put cuts to NWS under particular scrutiny, with many politicians in both parties pushing to undo the cuts.",
      "One government official told NBC News that NWS staff believe the Texas floods that killed more than 130 people and sparked questions about NWS forecasts strengthened the case for the agency to rehire hundreds of \u201cfront-line and mission critical\u201d staff. This official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel matters.",
      "Sorensen and Flood celebrated the \u201coverdue news\u201d in a joint statement. The two co-sponsored the Weather Workforce Improvement Act to protect National Weather Service employees from layoffs and early retirements by reclassifying them as critical to public safety. The bill has been introduced in the House but has yet to receive a vote.",
      "\u201cFor months, Congressman Flood and I have been fighting to get NOAA and NWS employees the support they need in the face of cuts to staff and funding,\u201d Sorensen said in a news release. \u201cHundreds of unfilled positions have caused NWS offices across the country to cancel weather balloon launches, forgo overnight staffing, and force remaining meteorologists to overwork themselves. While I welcome this overdue news to hire more meteorologists, we need to pass our bipartisan bill to ensure these new hires are permanent and protected from any future cuts.\u201d",
      "Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., also welcomed the move.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Weather Service declined to comment.",
      "A NOAA official who was not authorized to speak publicly told NBC News that it will likely take months to fill the hundreds of vacant positions. Currently, usajobs.gov lists nine open positions across NOAA, the parent agency of the National Weather Service.",
      "NOAA and the NWS were not immune to the aggressive DOGE cuts of the second Trump administration's early months, which included the firing, rehiring and refiring of some workers. The Commerce Department and NOAA fired more than 600 probationary employees at the agency alone on Feb. 27, including hurricane hunters, meteorologists and storm modelers.",
      "Five former directors of the National Weather Service warned that staff shortages could lead to \u201cneedless loss of life.\u201d"

      "As fast fashion has grown, so too have fast accessories, experts say.",
      "Typically under $10 \u2014 the price of a faux leather belt, plastic sunglasses or synthetic jewelry \u2014 the battery- or USB-powered personal fan comes in a variety of styles: Users can wear it around their necks, install it in their car and even clip it on their handbag to accompany their prized Labubu.",
      "The rapid growth of affordable accessories at online retailers like Temu and Shein, where fans cost as little as $4, is a selling point particularly for cash-strapped Gen Z buyers, said Sheng Lu, an assistant professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.",
      "\u201cThe bigger picture behind the portable fan boom is how the popularity of fast fashion is spreading to accessories today,\u201d Lu said. \u201cIt\u2019s this kind of affordability and accessibility that facilitates expansion in the market.\u201d",
      "The price could increase at the end of the month with the end of a tariff exemption for lower-cost goods coming into the U.S.",

      "As dozens of Texas state House Democrats near the one-week mark of their quorum break, fleeing the state indefinitely to prevent state GOP leaders from redrawing congressional lines, it's not just politics that loom over the strategy. It's money, too.",
      "The Democrats face a $500 fine for each day they're \"absent without leave,\" a rule put into place after Democratic legislators mounted a similar effort to deny the Legislature a quorum in 2021, plus a \"pro rata share\" of what the state House Sergeant at Arms spends in their efforts to compel them to return to the Capitol in Austin.",
      "Those fines have already eclipsed the $600 monthly salary the lawmakers receive from their part-time elected posts. And given their meager salaries, and the fact that the Legislature only meets for regular session for six months every two years, virtually every state lawmaker has a day job they've left behind in Texas, too.",
      "Those monetary factors, plus the realities of being far away from family and other obligations, further complicate the plan for Democrats who have fled their home state to deny Republicans the requisite number of lawmakers needed to move forward with business in the Legislature.",
      "It\u2019s all why state Democrats have been fundraising around their quorum break, why other Democrats have been lending a hand \u2014 and why Republicans have been targeting their funding.",
      "\"There\u2019s people who are single moms, single dads, with their kids, and we just do what we can. None of this is fun,\" state Rep. Gene Wu, the leader of the state House Democratic Caucus, told NBC News.",
      "\"We\u2019ve been away from our families for six months already, right?\" Wu continued, a reference to the six month legislative session that started in January. \"During the special session, I can\u2019t work. Most people can\u2019t work. They\u2019re away from their families. ... All of us are making actual, real sacrifices to be here.\"",
      "State Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer said when it came to financial support, he believed most members felt comfortable, but if anyone didn\u2019t, the rest of the members would have their backs.",
      "\u201cBecause of the bond we have with this, if any member was in need of anything \u2014 there are a lot of camp counselors around, like I\u2019m one of the camp counselors \u2014 we\u2019re all going to help each other, and we\u2019re not gonna leave anybody behind, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d he said.",
      "State Rep. Armando Walle, who represents a Houston-area district, was one of two Texas House members to come to Boston \u2014 not only to break quorum but to attend the National Conference of State Legislatures annual summit, where he felt he could spread the word.",

      "But Walle, who owns a small civil law firm, said he has continued to see clients and attend hearings virtually, allowing him to continue making a living while not being physically present at his office and in the Harris County courts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not independently wealthy,\u201d Walle told NBC News on the sidelines of the state legislatures summit. \u201cBut I have clients that are right now accommodating. They understand the situation. Our judges, as well.\u201d",
      "Financing the quorum break",
      "Texas Democrats haven't been clear about how much money they've raised for their efforts. Wu told NBC News that on the first day they announced their quorum break they raised about $20,000 in small-dollar donations.",
      "After Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker helped strike a deal with Texas Democratic leaders to take refuge in Illinois during the quorum break, speculation grew that Pritzker, a billionaire Democrat, was financially underwriting the efforts. Pritzker said more than once during press conferences this week that was not the case.",
      "\"I made clear to them that we would do everything logistically and otherwise to try to support them. I have not written a check or supported them financially, though I am not reticent to do that,\" Pritzker said. \"I have not done that but lots and lots of people around the country have.\u201d",
      "Former Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke built a potent fundraising machine during a run for Senate in 2018, and his political group, Powered by People, has been raising money to support the Texas Democrats. O'Rourke told CNN during a Wednesday interview the money was going to \"make sure they have the resources for their lodging, their food, their flights\" as well as their legal defense.",
      "That disclosure prompted state Attorney General Ken Paxton to announce he was investigating O'Rourke's group over that funding, which he called \"illegal bribes.\" (Paxton is running for Senate in 2026, and O\u2019Rourke has not ruled out a Senate bid of his own.)",
      "\"Any Democrat coward breaking the law by taking a Beto Bribe will be held accountable,\" Paxton said in a statement.",
      "In a statement responding to that investigation, O'Rourke invoked the Texas state House's impeachment of the attorney general in 2023. Paxton was later acquitted in the state Senate.",
      "\"The guy impeached for bribery is going after the folks trying to stop the theft of five congressional seats,\" O'Rourke said. \"Let's stop these thugs before they steal our country.\"",
      "No matter how the fundraising efforts go, eventually, something has to give. Walle, the Texas lawmaker who traveled from Boston to Chicago this week to continue breaking quorum, acknowledged to NBC News that the group's decampment from Texas couldn\u2019t go on forever.",
      "But he also wouldn\u2019t commit to an end date or a firm or specific end goal, saying only he wanted to continue \u201craising awareness\u201d and would likely remain out of state through the current special session.",

      "The Israeli air and ground offensive has killed more than 61,000 people in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to local health officials, whose numbers are considered credible by the United Nations.",
      "Gaza City, which before the war was the largest in the enclave, has already been targeted by multiple Israeli bombings and raids. Hundreds of thousands of people fled the city after being told to evacuate early in the war, but many have since returned and it is unclear how many are living there now.",
      "An Israeli offensive there could displace tens of thousands more people and make it even more difficult to deliver humanitarian aid.",
      "Netanyahu had said Thursday that Israel plans to take control of Gaza in its entirety but ultimately hand over the responsibility of governing it to Arab forces.",
      "In an interview on Fox News in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said Israelis \u201cintend to\u201d take over Gaza \u201cin order to assure our security, remove Hamas there\u201d and pass the enclave \u201cto civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel.\u201d",
      "He said Israel, which already controls about three-quarters of Gaza, does not want to \u201ckeep\u201d it long term.",
      "\u201cWe want to have a security perimeter. We don\u2019t want to govern it. We don\u2019t want to be there as a governing body,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening us and giving Gazans a good life. That\u2019s not possible with Hamas.\u201d",
      "A senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Thursday that any new steps the Israeli government takes in Gaza will not succeed.",
      "\u201cThe Israeli occupation seeks to break the will of the Palestinian people through more bloodshed and destruction of homes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it will fail.\u201d",
      "In recent weeks, global opinion about Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza appears to have shifted as images of emaciated children have appeared in media outlets around the world.",
      "The world\u2019s leading body on hunger, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, said last week that the \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201d is now unfolding in Gaza.",
      "Finding food has become more difficult and deadly for Palestinians after an American and Israeli-backed organization, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), took over the aid distribution process in late May, after Israel lifted a two-and-a-half-month blockade.",
      "According to the United Nations, 1,200 Palestinians have been killed and more than 8,100 injured since then while trying to obtain limited humanitarian aid. Of the 46 people killed across Gaza on Thursday, 20 were waiting for aid near U.S. distribution points, a spokesperson for the Gaza Health Ministry, Dr. Khalil al-Daqran, told NBC News.",
      "The Israeli military, which the United Nations human rights office says is responsible for most of the killings, says it does not target civilians.",
      "Several aid organizations have blamed GHF\u2019s aid distribution methods for the death of Palestinian civilians. Doctors Without Borders, a medical aid organization also known by its French name, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, criticized GHF\u2019s aid distribution  in a report issued Thursday.",
      "\u201cThe medical data is clear. This is not aid. It is orchestrated killing,\u201d the report said.",
      "GHF called the group\u2019s accusations \u201cfalse and disgraceful,\u201d saying they were aiding Hamas."

    "story": [
      "Disney and Lucasfilm said they have settled a lawsuit with actor Gina Carano, who sued them last year alleging she was wrongfully terminated from \"The Mandalorian\" in 2021.",
      "Carano filed a lawsuit in federal court in California in February 2024 alleging she was fired from her role on the show for voicing right-wing opinions on social media and claiming she suffered emotional damage and lost millions in income following the termination. She was seeking a court order that would require Lucasfilm to reinstate her or compensate her at least $75,000.",
      "The terms of the settlement were not immediately clear. The Lucasfilm statement said the agreement will \"resolve the issues in her pending lawsuit against the companies.\"",
      "\"Ms. Carano was always well respected by her directors, co-stars, and staff, and she worked hard to perfect her craft while treating her colleagues with kindness and respect,\" Lucasfilm said. \"With this lawsuit concluded, we look forward to identifying opportunities to work together with Ms. Carano in the near future.\"",
      "Carano also announced the settlement in a statement via her agent, saying the deal \"is the best outcome for all parties involved.\"",
      "\"I am excited to flip the page and move onto the next chapter. My desires remain in the arts, which is where I hope you will join me,\" she said.",
      "She thanked Elon Musk, whom she called \"a man I\u2019ve never met, who did this Good Samaritan deed for me in funding my lawsuit.\"",
      "When the suit was filed, Carano confirmed that Musk and X would provide financial backing for it, following through on an earlier Musk promise to foot the legal bill for any X users who said they had been discriminated against because of their activity on the social media platform.",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the settlement.",
      "Carano, in the past, has posted on social media likening modern political divides to the Holocaust and mocking people who wore masks during the pandemic. She also appeared to suggest there was voter fraud during the 2016 presidential election. There has been no evidence of widespread fraud.",
      "She claimed in the suit that male colleagues who made similar comments were not held to the same standards."

      "A Georgia sheriff\u2019s deputy who fatally shot a man who had been exonerated and freed from prison has been indicted on unrelated civil rights charges, federal prosecutors said Thursday.",
      "The civil rights counts against Buck Aldridge are not related to the fatal shooting of the exonerated man, Leonard Cure, whom Aldridge killed during a struggle after a traffic stop in 2023. No criminal charges were filed in that case.",
      "The federal indictment returned by a grand jury in Georgia, charges Aldridge with 13 counts, including four counts of deprivation of rights under color of law.",
      "He is accused of using excessive force against people arrested on four occasions, involving three victims. He is also accused of preparing \u201cmultiple\u201d misleading reports to justify the use of force, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Georgia said in a statement.",
      "The indictment alleges that in 2021 he used a Taser on one person without justification and kicked that person and that the same year he used a Taser on someone who was already handcuffed.",
      "Aldridge is also accused of punching a third victim in the face without legal justification in 2022 and of repeatedly using a Taser on that victim after he had stopped resisting arrest.",
      "The Camden County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Thursday that Aldridge has been relieved of his duties effective immediately.",
      "\u201cThe Camden County Sheriff\u2019s Office is committed to transparency and accountability at every level,\u201d Sheriff Kevin Chaney said in a statement.",
      "Aldridge was indicted on four counts of deprivation of rights under color of law and seven counts of falsification of records.",
      "Federal court records did not show an attorney for Aldridge and did not show any events or plea in the case announced Thursday.",
      "Aldridge fatally shot Cure, 53, on Oct. 16, 2023, after he pulled over Cure's pickup truck on Interstate 95 near the Georgia-Florida line for speeding and there was a struggle, officials have said and video showed.",

      "Dashcam video shows Cure in a struggle with Aldridge and Cure placing his hand on Aldridge's face and pushing his head back before Aldridge shoots him.",
      "Cure's family criticized the shooting at the time, saying it was unnecessary. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said at the time that Cure complied until he learned he would be placed under arrest.",
      "Three years before he was fatally shot, Cure was released from a Florida prison after having served 16 years for an armed robbery conviction. He had been sentenced to life.",
      "Cure was found to have been wrongfully convicted in 2020.",
      "A review by authorities that was sought by the Innocence Project of Florida found through an ATM receipt and other evidence that Cure was miles away from the robbery. The Broward County prosecutor\u2019s office concluded that he did not commit the crime."

      "The Arizona man accused of targeting exotic dancers in gunpoint robberies and brutally killing one of the victims years later repeatedly reversed his decision on plea deals in the robbery cases, including one that would have reduced the charges to a low-level felony with little prison time, court documents show.",
      "In 2021, Cudjoe Young, 29, turned down an agreement to plead guilty to disorderly conduct and serve 2\u00bd years in prison followed by probation, according to a joint pretrial statement obtained by NBC News.",
      "Weeks later, Young reversed himself and told prosecutors he wanted the deal, according to the statement. He ultimately rejected the offer during a court hearing.",
      "For more on this case, listen to the Dateline: True Crime Weekly podcast.",
      "Young faces a maximum prison sentence of 36 years combined in connection with charges of armed robbery in October 2020 and attempted armed robbery the following month, according to the statement.",
      "The statement does not indicate what prompted the reversals.",
      "Young, once described by his lawyers as an aspiring professional football player, also stands accused with two co-defendants in a horrific murder plot that targeted one of the robbery victims, Mercedes Vega.",
      "Vega was found beaten, burned and shot in an abandoned car on an interstate outside Phoenix on April 17, 2023, less than two years after Young rejected the plea.",
      "Young has pleaded not guilty in both cases, which are ongoing. A co-defendant in the murder case, Sencere Hayes, has pleaded not guilty. A third defendant in that case, Jared Gray, has not been arraigned.",
      "Authorities have not identified a motive in the killing, but Vega\u2019s family has said they believe it was to silence her. Vega, 22, had been scheduled to appear at a court hearing in the armed robbery case on the day she was found dead, according to her mother, Erika Pillsbury.",
      "Vega\u2019s parents have said she might still be alive had the robbery cases not been repeatedly delayed and had she been better protected while she waited to testify.",
      "A spokesperson for the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment. In a motion filed last week, the deputy county attorney prosecuting the robberies pointed to a recent effort by Young to change attorneys in those cases and accused him of \u201ca calculated effort to manipulate the court into postponing his trial.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has been almost five years since the crimes alleged in this case and justice has been continually denied,\u201d the prosecutor wrote.",
      "Aaron Reed, a lawyer for Young, declined to comment, noting that the pleas were offered before he became Young\u2019s attorney. Reed also would not comment on the delays, but in a filing he called the prosecutor\u2019s allegations \u201coff base and false.\u201d",
      "The pretrial statement shows that Young rejected three plea offers from August 2021 to last December. On Jan. 27, 2022, roughly a month after he rejected the disorderly conduct plea, he reversed himself and said he wanted the deal, according to the statement.",
      "\u201cWith an agreement reached we asked [the judge] to fit us in for a change of plea after lunch,\u201d the statement says, noting that all parties arrived at the hearing after the break.",
      "\u201cDefendant again rejected the plea,\u201d the statement says.",
      "Another proposed agreement would have reduced the charges to attempted armed robbery with a maximum prison sentence of 3\u00bd years. Young initially indicated he would accept the offer, according to the statement, but needed time to get his affairs in order.",
      "He later rejected the plea during a court hearing, the document says.",
      "Prosecutors\u2019 final offer came on Dec. 18, 2024, nearly two years after Vega\u2019s death: In exchange for pleading guilty to two counts of aggravated assault, he would serve 7\u00bd years in prison, according to the statement.",
      "\u201cNo settlement was held because Defendant didn\u2019t believe it would be fruitful,\u201d the document says.",
      "Trial in the two robbery cases was scheduled for last month, but the proceedings were delayed after Young asked for his lawyer to be removed. He initially planned to represent himself, the former lawyer said, though he appeared at his arraignment for murder charges last Friday with Reed, a private attorney who is representing him on the murder and robbery cases.",
      "Court documents, police reports and interviews show that three dancers who worked at Le Girls, a Phoenix strip club, told authorities that a masked gunman robbed them or tried to rob them after they finished working late shifts from November 2019 to November 2020.",
      "Young was charged in two of the cases, including Vega\u2019s. No suspect was identified in the third case.",
      "Vega\u2019s family has said that after she was robbed, she left her Phoenix apartment building for what she believed was a more secure home in nearby Tempe. Authorities have said she was violently abducted from the parking garage of the new building on the night of April 16, 2023.",
      "Vega was found hours later in the back of a Chevrolet Malibu on Interstate 10 near Tonopah, roughly an hour west of Phoenix, after a motorist reported seeing a burning car.",
      "A medical examiner\u2019s report listed Vega\u2019s cause of death as conflagration, blunt force and ballistic injuries. The report noted the smell of bleach in her throat.",
      "A probable cause statement in the case alleges that after the Malibu was bought through an online seller, Young paid two people to pick it up. Authorities have also suggested that he may have bought his co-defendants\u2019 plane tickets to Arizona from Tennessee, where he is originally from.",
      "Authorities have said fingerprints found in the Malibu and in Vega\u2019s car link his co-defendants to the murder."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Commercial satellite images show the Israeli military building up troops and equipment near the border with Gaza that would support a possible new ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave, according to three U.S. officials and a former official who viewed the imagery.",
      "The images show troop movements and formations that the four sources recognized as signs of an imminent major ground operation.",
      "Israel\u2019s security Cabinet approved a plan early Friday to take over Gaza City, the Associated Press reported, citing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office. The plan falls short of the full occupation of Gaza that Netanyahu had discussed earlier.",
      "If there is a new military operation, it could include efforts to retrieve hostages held by Hamas and expand humanitarian assistance in areas outside the fighting, the three U.S. officials and a person briefed on Israeli discussions said. Israeli troops have been conducting ground operations in Gaza since Oct. 27, 2023, with pauses during two ceasefires.",
      "Netanyahu said Thursday on Fox News that Israel intended to take control of all of Gaza. \u201cWe intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza and to pass it to civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel. That\u2019s what we want to do.\u201d",
      "Pressed again on that point, specifically on whether he meant Israel would \u201ctake control of the entire 26-mile Gaza Strip,\u201d Netanyahu said: \u201cWell, we don\u2019t want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We don\u2019t want to govern it.\u201d",
      "The troop buildup comes during a tense time in relations between the United States and Israel. On July 28, Netanyahu and President Donald Trump had a private phone conversation that devolved into shouting amid White House concerns over how the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, a U.S.- and Israel-backed relief effort, is working, according to a senior U.S. official, two former U.S. officials and a Western official who were briefed on the matter.",
      "The recent flare-up of tensions between Trump and Netanyahu began July 27. Appearing at an event in Jerusalem that day, Netanyahu said: \u201cThere is no policy of starvation in Gaza. And there is no starvation in Gaza.\u201d",
      "When Trump was asked about those comments the next day during a trip to Scotland, he contradicted Netanyahu. He said that he had seen images of children in Gaza who \u201clook very hungry,\u201d that there is \u201creal starvation\u201d there and that \u201cyou can\u2019t fake that.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu then privately demanded a phone call with Trump, the senior U.S. official and the former U.S. official briefed on the call said. The two leaders were connected within hours, those two officials said.",
      "Netanyahu told Trump on the phone that widespread starvation in Gaza is not real and that it had been fabricated by Hamas, said the senior U.S. official, two former U.S. officials and the Western official, all of whom were briefed on the call. Trump interrupted Netanyahu and began yelling, they said, saying that he did not want to hear that the starvation is fake and that his aides had shown him proof that children there are starving, they said.",
      "White House officials declined to comment on the phone call. Israeli officials declined to comment.",
      "One of the former U.S. officials briefed on the call described it as \u201ca direct, mostly one-way conversation about the status of humanitarian aid\u201d in which Trump \u201cwas doing most of the talking.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe U.S. not only feels like the situation is dire, but they own it because of GHF,\u201d the former official said, referring to the Gaza Humanitarian Fund.",
      "The phone call prompted a trip to the region last week by Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, to find a unified path forward in the war.",
      "Israeli officials were pleased with Witkoff\u2019s visit, according to the Western official and the source briefed on Israeli discussions. The Israelis viewed everything from his body language to the questions he asked as indicators that they were able to effectively communicate the challenges Israel faces. The Israeli officials also addressed international criticism of GHF with Witkoff, explaining why, in their opinion, some critics want it to fail, the source briefed on Israeli discussions said.",
      "GHF has been working in Gaza since May. It operates only in specific designated distribution sites that are far away from some Palestinians who need food, leading to large crowds that Israeli troops \u2014 who are stationed nearby \u2014 have at times fired upon. As of late July, more than 1,000 Palestinians had been killed while seeking food, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. GHF has been boycotted by the U.N., which has operated its own aid distribution network in Gaza.",
      "Witkoff pressed officials about whether current relief efforts can meet ongoing need or should expand further, according to the source briefed on Israeli discussions.",
      "Witkoff has since returned. He briefed Trump on his visit over dinner Monday night, according to a White House official. Their discussion included humanitarian aid in Gaza and Witkoff\u2019s meeting with Israeli officials and hostage families.",
      "Asked by reporters Tuesday whether he would support Israel\u2019s occupying Gaza, Trump said he is focused on getting people there food. As for a military occupation, he said: \u201cI really can\u2019t say. That\u2019s going to be pretty much up to Israel.\u201d",
      "White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News: \u201cWe do not comment on the President\u2019s private conversations. President Trump is focused on returning all the hostages and getting the people in Gaza fed.\u201d",
      "A new Gaza ceasefire has proven elusive. Israel does not believe Hamas is motivated to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages, the source briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official said, and it believes a military offensive is the likeliest option.",
      "The international community has recently been heaping pressure on Israel, with the United Kingdom, France, Canada and others saying they may move to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. General Assembly in September.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we are at a brick wall, with countries saying they are recognizing Palestine,\u201d said the person briefed on Israeli discussions. \u201cNow all ideas are being exhausted.\u201d",
      "The Western official said an offensive remains a very dangerous prospect for the Israeli military because Hamas is very dug in and there is \u201cno chance they can kill every fighter.\u201d",
      "The Western official added that there is concern that Hamas will kill hostages or put them in the way of fighting if it is threatened.",
      "Israeli forces know the general area where all the hostages are, said the person briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official, one of whom added that the belief is that area is in central Gaza.",
      "\u201cLooking at the condition of hostages, it\u2019s clear that they don\u2019t have much more time,\u201d one of the sources added in reference to a recent video of an emaciated Israeli hostage inside a cramped Gaza tunnel digging his own grave."

    "story": [
      "The rollout of a new Instagram Map has prompted confusion among some users of the app, who voiced their privacy concerns online after Meta unveiled the feature.",
      "The purpose of the maps feature, according to a press release from Meta, is to provide a \u201clightweight\u201d method for users to connect with each other and explore local happenings by allowing people to share where they are in real time. Users can access their \u201cmaps\u201d by going to their DMs.",
      "When users click on the map, it shows the geolocation of users who have opted into sharing their location, based on the last time they opened Instagram or shared an Instagram story. When users first open the map, they are prompted with options of \u201cwho can see your location,\u201d allowing them to choose whether or not they want to share their location.",
      "After the feature was unveiled on Wednesday, users began sharing screenshots of what the map looks like on their pages.  A handful of posts criticizing the feature have amassed hundreds of thousands of views as they circulate across X, Threads, TikTok and Instagram itself. Some of the most viral posts were from people like influencer and \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise alum Kelley Flanagan, who issued a warning to people online to turn their location-sharing off, suggesting it could be a risk to their privacy and safety.",
      "\u201cMeta has a poor track record when it comes to data privacy,\u201d Lia Haberman, author of the social media newsletter ICYMI, told NBC News in an email interview.",
      "Just this week, Haberman noted that a California jury ruled Meta violated the state\u2019s Invasion of Privacy Act in a case involving the period-tracking app Flo. (A Meta spokesperson told CNBC that the company disagreed with the ruling.)",
      "\u201cUser data is Meta\u2019s golden goose, it\u2019s what they\u2019ve been able to sell to advertisers for years \u2014 mostly ethically and legally but not always,\u201d Haberman said.",
      "Meta emphasized that \u201clocation sharing is off unless you opt in. If you do share your location with friends, you have controls to customize this experience.\u201d Users can select specific followers who see their location, or those on their \u201cclose friends\u201d list.",
      "Instagram head Adam Mosseri doubled down on that sentiment, writing in a Threads post that he uses \u201cthe map to share what I\u2019m up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully.\u201d",
      "Still, Haberman said, she\u2019s concerned that users won\u2019t realize the full extent of what they\u2019ve provided Instagram access to, or when their location might show up on the map, through tagging places in their posts or just opening the app.",
      "The platform is not the first to introduce such location-sharing capabilities. Many young social media users have utilized a similar feature on the app Snapchat, where \u201cSnap Map\u201d has been in place since June 2017. Some social media users also likened Instagram Maps to the once-popular FourSquare Swarm app, which allowed users to \u201ccheck-in\u201d to their favorite places, discover new spots and stay connected with friends.",
      "In recent years, Instagram and other social media platforms have faced scrutiny from lawmakers and organizations about online safety, particularly around teen users.",
      "With Maps, Meta says that its supervision features allow parents to be notified when a teen starts sharing their location, and can turn their teen\u2019s access off to the feature at any time, if they use Meta\u2019s parental controls. (Though many teens maintain accounts hidden from their parents.)",
      "Common Sense Media, a group that studies the impact of media and technology on kids and families, published a report in 2023 that found that location-sharing on social media platforms, which it defined as \u201cautomatic sharing of users\u2019 locations,\u201d had two potential negative experiences for young female users. There are \u201cconcerns about safety,\u201d the group wrote, as well as the \u201cFear of missing out (\u201cFOMO\u201d) or social exclusion\u201d among users. But the positive impact could be \u201cSocial connection.\u201d",
      "Still, \u201cgirls were most likely to say that location-sharing (45%) and public accounts (33%) have had a mostly negative effect on them, compared to other features,\u201d the report found.",
      "In 2024, after news outlets first reported on Instagram\u2019s plans to develop a \u201cFriend Map,\u201d several lawmakers issued concerns about how this type of feature could cause harm to younger users.",
      "\u201cInstagram\u2019s proposed feature will require the tracking of young people and their devices\u2019 locations,\u201d Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., and Rep. Lori Trahan, D-Mass., wrote in a May 21, 2024 letter to Mosseri, calling geolocation surveillance of minors \u201can unnecessary violation of privacy.\u201d",
      "Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., also responded to the \u201cFriend Map\u201d development reports last year, writing in an X post in March, \u201cWe should be doing all we can to protect our kids\u2019 safety on social media \u2014 not exposing their real-time location to pedophiles and traffickers.\u201d",
      "Blackburn raised similar concerns about Snap Map in 2019, writing in a letter to CEO Evan Spiegel that \u201cif location is left in public mode, Snap Map can reveal the location of gullible child users to complete strangers, along with their Snap video feed.\u201d",
      "At a Senate hearing in 2021, Jennifer Stout, vice president of global public policy for Snap Inc., said the app \u201cmakes it intentionally difficult for strangers to find people that they don\u2019t know. We do not have open profiles, we do not have browsable pictures. We don\u2019t have the ability to understand who people\u2019s friends are and where they go to school.\u201d",
      "Representatives from Blackburn, Castor and Trahan\u2019s offices did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday regarding Instagram\u2019s official launch of their new feature.",
      "Many Instagram users said they worry that the new feature could also put other vulnerable groups at risk \u2014 including creators, who have very public personas, and women, who often face harassment online.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re constantly broadcasting where you are in real time, you\u2019re sharing your daily routines,\u201d Caitlin Sarian, known to her 1.4 million Instagram followers as cybersecuritygirl, said in a video post on Wednesday. \u201c... where you live, where you work, literally everything about you to potential hackers, stalkers, bad exes, all of the above.\u201d",
      "Another creator, known as Nerdytravelingwriter on TikTok, echoed similar concerns in a video posted on Wednesday, calling it a \u201csafety issue.\u201d",
      "\u201cThink of how many creators have stalkers,\u201d the creator, who has over 895,000 followers on TikTok said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of my followers who just got out of abusive relationships. They\u2019re still mutuals with their abusers.\u201d",
      "Instagram\u2019s help center does note that users are able to hide their locations in the map feature from specific accounts if they choose, which could help those who know which profiles may want to use the information for malicious purposes.",
      "\u201cIf you see that you\u2019ve shared your location in the past with Instagram via phone settings, it does NOT mean the map feature is turned on automatically or that people can see your location,\u201d the platform wrote in its Instagram story. \u201cThe reason you\u2019re seeing your story, post or reel show up on the map is because you\u2019ve tagged it with a location. It will appear on the map for 24 hours and does not share your real-time or live location.\u201d",
      "When asked for comment on the concerns, a Meta spokesperson reiterated Instagram\u2019s policy, stating that the Map feature \u201cis off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location.\u201d",
      "Haberman, who was among those posting about the recent Instagram news on Threads, suggested one of the main reasons Instagram\u2019s feature is being met with some criticism is because it came as a surprise to users.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s fine for something with no stakes,\u201d she said. \u201cbut a map of people\u2019s locations has a very real world impact. More care should have been taken.\u201d"

Thanks to its enamel coating and cast-iron material, it distributes heat extremely well, which helps evenly cook food, especially lean meat and poultry. Plus, I find that enamel-coated cast-iron pots work best for soups and stews, since they simmer faster and more evenly. The lid\u2019s shape helps baste food with steam as it cooks, which prevents food from drying out. It also has a loop handle on each side and it\u2019s compatible with all cooktops, according to the brand.",

      "How to keep dogs cool: The top do\u2019s and don\u2019ts, according to vets",
      "Regardless of whether you live in a warm climate year-round or temperatures are rising in your area due to seasonality, your goal as a dog owner is to prevent your pet from overheating in the first place instead of working to cool them down afterward, says Kaplan. Here are a few key ways to keep your dog cool:",
      "Limit how much time your dog spends outside in the heat. If temperatures are moderately warm, keep outdoor activity to a minimum and try to only spend time outside during the coolest parts of the day (the early morning and late night), says Satchu.",
      "When your pet is outdoors, keep them in the shade as much as possible.",
      "In extreme temperatures, like those you may experience during a heat wave, only take your dog outside for about five to 10 minutes, or just enough time to relieve themselves, says Satchu.",
      "Never leave dogs in hot cars \u2014 doing so results in numerous pet deaths every year, says Kratt. Temperatures inside cars can quickly rise to life-threatening levels, even if you crack the windows open or park in the shade, he says. Instead, leave your dog at home while running errands when it\u2019s hot out.",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Like humans, dogs\u2019 main way of dissipating heat is through evaporation. But unlike humans, dogs can\u2019t sweat through their skin, so they mainly rely on panting. Dogs inhale air as they pant, which makes the moisture from their tongues, nasal passages and the lining of their lungs evaporate. This process allows their bodies to cool down, according to the American Kennel Club. Dogs also dissipate heat through their paws, which have sweat glands on them, although they sweat very little compared to humans.",
      "There\u2019s no exact temperature that tells you if it\u2019s too hot outside for your dog. But as a rule of thumb, if it\u2019s too hot for you, it\u2019s too hot for your pet, says Kratt.",
      "Bonomo says you should start taking precautions with your dog once temperatures are in the mid-70s. Once you factor in humidity, 70-degree temperatures, which may be relatively comfortable for us, can feel much warmer for dogs since their average body temperatures are naturally a few degrees higher than humans, experts told me.",
      "How dogs are impacted by warm temperatures varies based on their physical characteristics, age, weight, medical conditions and activity level. Generally, however, dogs with dark fur and brachycephalic dogs (those who have flat or pushed-in faces, like bulldogs and pugs), have extra trouble with managing heat, says Bonomo. Puppies and senior dogs are also more susceptible to heatstroke than adolescent and adult dogs, says Satchu.",
      "There are two common misconceptions experts often hear when it comes to dogs and heat.",
      "Don\u2019t assume that only large dogs can overheat, says Kaplan. Dogs are intolerant of heat no matter their size.",
      "Dog breeds with long hair are just as prone to heat-related issues as breeds with short coats. \u201cLong hair can actually help keep a dog cool by acting as an insulator, similar to how insulation in your home keeps the AC inside,\u201d says Satchu. Kratt doesn\u2019t recommend shaving dogs with long or double coats in the summer, as it could increase their chance of overheating and sunburn.",
      "During the summer months, the ideal indoor temperature for most dogs is 75 to 78 degrees Fahrenheit, although, cooler temperatures are also safe for them, says Kratt.  Dogs typically start showing signs of overheating between 81 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the American Kennel Club. Thus, 85 degrees Fahrenheit is the absolute maximum indoor temperature dogs should be exposed to if necessary \u2014 it should not be their norm, and it\u2019s only safe if they have access to plenty of fresh water, can lay on cool surfaces like tile floors and are not exposed to direct sunlight, says Kratt.",
      "If you have further questions about the ideal indoor temperature for your dog, consult your vet. They can give you a more exact recommendation based on your pet\u2019s age, physical characteristics and medical conditions.",
      "Heat begins to impact dogs\u2019 health when they reach critically high body temperatures, at which point they can become dehydrated and their body can begin to have multiple organ failure, says Satchu. If this isn\u2019t rapidly treated, pets may suffer permanent organ damage or potentially die from complications, she says. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to check on your dog when they spend time outside and keep an eye out for telltale signs they\u2019re overheating, including:",

    "summary": "Skims is selling a $48 face wrap that\u2019s supposed to sculpt your jaw. We asked dermatologists if it actually works.",
    "story": [
      "Slathering on beef tallow to hydrate your skin, using onion shampoo for hair growth, dabbing diaper cream on your face \u2014 there are an endless number of beauty hacks and tricks that sound wonky, but actually have some good benefits. Most recently, a face wrap from Skims is garnering chatter online. Skims\u2019 newest product is made from a stretchy material that\u2019s designed to wrap around your chin, upper neck and head and, when worn overnight, is supposed to support your face for a more sculpted look in the morning.",
      "Here\u2019s the thing: Skims is not the first brand to launch a face wrap. A quick search on Amazon turns up dozens of options, all promising to give your face a sculpted look. So, do they really work? We turned to a dermatologist and a plastic surgeon to find out \u2014 check out what they had to say below.",
      "Do face wraps actually work?",
      "Before diving into whether or not face wraps work, it\u2019s helpful to understand what they even are. \u201cFace sculpting bands, also known as compression garments, are primarily used in our practice as part of the post-operative recovery process following facial plastic surgery,\u201d says Dr. Michelle Lee, a board-certified plastic surgeon and the founder of Perk Plastic Surgery in Beverly Hills. \u201cBy providing external support, the compression helps mechanically reduce facial swelling, thereby promoting tissue healing and ultimately optimizing and expediting recovery.\u201d",
      "But what if you haven\u2019t had plastic surgery? \u201cWe do not advise using facial bands as a way to sculpt or permanently change facial shape,\u201d says Lee. That said, both plastic surgeons I spoke to agree that using one may have a super short-term impact. \u201cIt is possible these products could help someone if they are having issues with swelling around their jowls, but it would be a very temporary fix,\u201d says Dr. Peter Bittar, a board-certified dermatologist in Miami, Dermatologist & Mohs Surgeon at Miami Dermatology & Laser Institute. \u201cSimply compressing these areas with a wrap may reduce swelling or puffiness for a short period of time, but will not lead to long term changes.\u201d",
      "Are there risks to wearing a face wrap?",
      "For the most part, wearing a face wrap is low-risk. That said, our experts said there are a few things you should be on the lookout for if you decide to partake in this trend. These things include:",
      "Irritation: The skin on your face is sensitive and you may react poorly to the fabric these wraps are made from. They can cause skin irritation or contact dermatitis, according to Lee.Discomfort: \u201cIf the band places pressure on the jaw, prolonged or improper use could also potentially contribute to TMJ issues,\u201d says Lee. Poor circulation: If the wrap is too tight around your neck and chin, you may impair circulation, which could actually lead to more puffiness.",

      "Poor circulation: If the wrap is too tight around your neck and chin, you may impair circulation, which could actually lead to more puffiness.",
      "Overall, our experts agree there are not extreme risks associated with trying a face wrap \u2014 there is just not likely a lasting benefit. Below, they share some ways you can get a more lasting sculpted look.",
      "Other ways to sculpt the face",
      "There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to getting a more sculpted look, says Bittar. \u201cThis is why it is best to work with a doctor to figure out what may work for you.\u201d Some of the things they may guide you toward range from lifestyle changes to in-office procedures. Here are a few things our experts said can help encourage more definition:",
      "Diet: \u201cA low-sodium diet can help reduce overall facial puffiness,\u201d says Lee. This means cutting out salt as much as possible and focusing on nutritious, whole foods. In-office procedures: \u201cTo make a significant impact on the shape of our face and neck, procedures such as lasers, fillers, bio-stimulatory injectables, fat removal, or surgical lifts are typically needed,\u201d says Bittar.Skin care: Experts have previously told us that skin care products with ingredients like retinoids and peptides can help with skin elasticity. Though you can\u2019t expect to get the same results you would with an in-office procedure, many people find incorporating a new product into their skin care routine to be the easiest route.",

      "Gomez said Swift acted very \"sweet\" when she told her about \"Love Story.\"",
      "\"She's a chameleon. She's incredible,\" she said.",

      "Mariska Hargitay and Chris Meloni were recently seen on the set of \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d smiling, embracing and touching faces.",
      "The photos thrilled their fans for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, their characters, Capt. Olivia Benson and Detective Elliot Stabler, haven\u2019t physically been in the same scene on \u201cSVU\u201d since the Season 24 finale back in 2023 (yes, you read that right).",
      "Secondly, the beloved pair also reunited with one of their OG \u201cSVU\u201d co-stars, Dann Florek, who portrayed Special Victims Unit boss Capt. Donald Cragen until the character\u2019s retirement in Season 15. Meloni shared photos of himself with Hargitay and Florek on his Instagram page Aug. 2.",
      "\u201cHangin with friends on a Friday nite,\u201d he captioned the trio of pics.",
      "Florek last made an appearance on \u201cSVU\u201d via FaceTime during the show\u2019s 500th episode in 2021, and he\u2019s made some appearances on \u201cOC\u201d for some sentimental scenes with Meloni.",
      "He appeared to be casually dressed in his photos with Meloni and Hargitay, who were both sporting suits and looked to be in character.",
      "Hargitay posted about being together again with Meloni on Instagram Aug. 4, sharing a photo of her and her longtime friend holding hands and smiling.",
      "\u201cReunited,\u201d she wrote, along with two blue heart emoji.",
      "New Photos Show Mariska Hargitay and Chris Meloni, or Olivia Benson and Elliot Stabler, Hugging",
      "Now, to one of the most important points in this very unserious investigation: What is the story behind the photos of these two hugging?",
      "Cameras are visible in one of the pictures, which could mean fans will get just their fifth canon Benson-Stabler hug in 27 seasons. (We will never forget the one hug that was taken from us.)",
      "What Is Happening With Benson and Stabler's Relationship?",
      "There are also lingering questions about Benson and Stabler\u2019s relationship status. While Meloni guest-starred last season in a scene to rough up a guy who approached Benson\u2019s son, one of Stabler\u2019s last big \u201cSVU\u201d moments with Benson happened when they almost kissed in her kitchen back in Season 24.",
      "She later told him that was \u201ca bad time\u201d for her, and Stabler said it was \u201cjust not the right moment.\u201d (OK, then when is the right moment?)",
      "Let us not forget the compass necklace, a gift from Stabler to Benson in the Season 24 finale crossover event with \u201cOC.\u201d He told her he hoped it would lead her to happiness.",
      "Hargitay told TODAY.com in January 2024 that she and Meloni designed that necklace together.",
      "\u201cI wanted Chris\u2019 impact because he\u2019s so thoughtful and specific and does such a deep dive on things like this that matter,\u201d Hargitay said. \u201cI wanted it to mean as much to him as it meant to me. So he\u2019s the one that came up with what the (symbols on the compass) stood for.\u201d",
      "Meloni later told us the necklace symbolizes \u201ctrue north.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou know, you\u2019re the star by which you navigate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of a fitting \u2014 we\u2019ve both been navigating turbulent seas, whether it\u2019s in the storytelling part of it or in the personal life part of the storytelling. I think the sense of navigation.\u201d",
      "Benson loaned the necklace to a victim\u2019s mother in the Season 25 finale, and it hasn\u2019t been seen since. (We think it\u2019s the right moment to bring that back \u2014 unless she has found her happiness with a certain bald-headed detective.)",
      "When Were Benson and Stabler Last on Screen Together?",
      "Hargitay and Meloni\u2019s characters last shared the screen in the most recent season of \u201cOrganized Crime\u201d in an episode Meloni wrote.",
      "Stabler spent part of the episode in a coma, and Meloni told TODAY.com in April that Benson was his character\u2019s \u201cicebreaker\u201d that could \u201calmost break through\u201d Stabler\u2019s coma.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s her voice that he hears,\u201d he said.",
      "Benson and Stabler also shared some uncharacteristically silly scenes, like when Stabler wanted to leave the hospital and told Benson she could help him out or \u201cjust stand there and watch me get naked.\u201d",
      "Meloni described that moment as \u201ca nod to the fans.\u201d",
      "It was also important for him to write the episode featuring Hargitay because he said he \u201cinevitably\u201d rewrites their characters\u2019 scenes.",
      "\u201cI thought it was a natural and correct evolution to get to gain greater insight into their engagements \u2014 maybe not where they\u2019re going and all that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are bigger-ticket items. How they speak to each other, how they feel about each other.\u201d",
      "One thing is for certain: It\u2019s about time viewers get some answers about what\u2019s going on with these two. And we can only hope that Season 27 of \u201cSVU,\u201d which premieres Sept. 25 on NBC, will give us some."

      "Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d has found its place on the platform\u2019s Top 10 list.",
      "Since its July 21 release, the television series, based on the novel by May Cobb, has evolved into a cultural moment, racking up over 11 million views on Netflix, per Deadline.",
      "On TikTok, thousands of viewers are sharing their thoughts on show\u2019s roller coaster of twists and soap-level drama.",
      "Where did all this buzz come from? Here\u2019s what to know about the show's appeal and the phenomenon it sparked.",
      "What is \u2018The Hunting Wives\u2019 about?",
      "Originally created for Starz, the erotic thriller was acquired by Netflix.",
      "\"The Hunting Wives\" follows PR exec Sophie O\u2019Neil (Brittany Snow) as she moves from Boston to East Texas with her architect husband Graham (Evan Jonigkeit). She immediately finds herself out of place in an inner circle of wealthy Southern housewives who call themselves the \"Hunting Wives.\"",
      "These women seemingly couldn't be more different from Sophie: Not only does the elite clique embrace gun culture, but also they also adopt an unabashed stay-at-home lifestyle that is foreign to her. When Sophie asks her new friends what they do for work, they emphasize that their job is to \u201cwife.\u201d",
      "Along with culture shock, Sophie grapples with her looming dark past through frequent flashbacks.",
      "Sophie eventually becomes enthralled by the group\u2019s queen bee, Margo Banks (Malin A\u030akerman), the wife of Graham\u2019s boss, Jed (Dermot Mulroney), an oil tycoon running for the governor of Texas. Margo takes Sophie under her wing, and their friendship quickly escalates into a steamy affair.",
      "A throughline of the show is its twisty murder plot. After local teenager Abby (Madison Wolfe) is found dead, Sophie finds herself inconveniently tangled in the mystery. As the town searches for the culprit, its residents cultivate messy love triangles and secret relationships on the side.",
      "Why has 'The Hunting Wives' become such a phenomenon?",
      "Part of the appeal of the \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d is that it goes there \u2014  all manner of daring places.",
      "Each character is shamelessly committed to making jaw-dropping decisions. Take, for example, Margo\u2019s affair with an 18-year-old high school student who also happens to be Abby\u2019s boyfriend. Or Sophie\u2019s decision to rashly secure a firearm, a choice that backfires after she blacks out on the night of Abby\u2019s death ... and her gun turns out to be the murder weapon.",
      "Then, of course, there are the show\u2019s multiple murders and frequent extramarital escapades.",
      "\u201cThe Hunting Wives\u2019 consistently prioritizes steamy scenes over sensible plotting or nuanced characters, juicy twists over deep emotions or big ideas. It might all be incredibly frustrating, if it were not also so wildly entertaining,\u201d The Hollywood Reporter writes of the show.",
      "The show\u2019s hype is not necessarily due to its quality: Some fans on Reddit point out, Margo\u2019s wig looks (perhaps purposefully) unrealistic, and there may be more than a few plot holes.",
      "Instead, the series\u2019 shock factor is what makes it bingeable.",
      "\u201cLook, it isn\u2019t Emmy award winning TV. The acting only ranges slightly fair. The characters are terrible people,\u201d one Reddit user writes. \u201cBut I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t sucked in from the very first episode.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything has been said regarding it being the perfect summer sleazy schlockfest we all love,\u201d another adds.",
      "In addition to its wild plot twists, the show\u2019s depiction of Margo and Sophie\u2019s queer relationship has led to chatter.",
      "Them, an LGBTQ+ publication, writes that \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d might be \u201cthe gayest show of the year.\" Many fans have posted their reactions to Margo and Sophie\u2019s relationship, crediting the show's suggestive scenes for their sexual awakenings or awkward watch moments with family members.",
      "\u201cWith all of the attention the show is receiving, viewer reactions have proved feverish, with fans across party lines gamely questioning their sexuality after witnessing Margo\u2019s effects on Sophie,\u201d NBC Out writes of this phenomenon.",
      "Watchers also have also found themselves enthralled by the series\u2019 political message.",
      "\u201cWhen you first start watching the show, it\u2019s just a very fun, campy romp\u2026 It really feels like they are glamorizing this certain type of lifestyle. But, in actuality, it is such a scathing review of the hypocrisy of the nuclear family (and) God fearing Republicans,\u201d one reviewer theorizes on TikTok.",
      "\u201cPerhaps the show\u2019s most intriguing wrinkle involves incorporating just enough political references to feel like a satire of Southern-fried hypocrisy,\u201d Slate writes.",
      "This layer adds, for some, enough to turn the show from a beach read on screen to something a little deeper.",
      "However, not everyone is a fan \u2014 some criticize the show for being too vulgar or underdeveloped.",
      "But the show\u2019s blend of lustful romance, a messy murder plot and perhaps a bit of political humor is what has many fans knocking on Netflix\u2019s door for another salacious installment."

      "Creators are posting before and after makeover videos where they turn themselves into their idea of a city or region\u2019s ideal of beauty. The hope is to achieve a look that scores a \u201c10 out of 10\u201d on a scale of attractiveness.",
      "Some videos, which users post to the song \u201cCandy\u201d by Foxy Brown, have upwards of a million views, but commentators have mixed reactions to what the moment is trying to say.",
      "Why are people turning themselves into a (insert city here) 10?",
      "The \u201cturning myself into a 10\u201d trend references how beauty ideals vary by geographic region.",
      "Back in 2015, Vogue published an article defining \u201cNew York City vs. Los Angeles Beauty Rules.\u201d The conversation continued on social media. According to users on Reddit, a \u201cNew York 10\u201d might be \u201cmore high fashioned\u201d while a \u201cLA 10\u201d might be \u201cmore beachy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThinking about that element of how beauty is attached to a particular place is not new,\u201d Katherine Phelps, a gender and women\u2019s studies professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Now, users of a primarily female demographic post style and makeup transformations online where they turn themselves into a place's version of a \u201c10.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so gendered. When we are talking about someone being a '10,' we\u2019re speaking from a place of that woman is deemed attractive by a man,\" Phelps adds.",
      "This moment for the trend is different because it covers a wider range of locations than the classic \"New York vs. LA\" debate. Users have created videos inspired by their experiences in places like Atlanta, Texas, France and Kansas \u2014 and yes, New York and Los Angeles.",
      "Some are spoofs on the idea of conventional beauty \u2014 one version of a Colorado 10, for example, is in athletic clothes and no makeup. Another idea of a New York 10 is having an apartment with amenities like a washing machine and garbage disposal. Others are saying they're a worldwide 10 \u2014 then dressing up as Mr. Worldwide, Pitbull.",
      "One user who participated in the trend is @maycietilley, who posted a video of herself turning into a \u201cUtah 7,\" as other users have done.",
      "\u201cThe beauty standard in Utah and its culture is very high, especially compared to other states,\u201d Tilley tells TODAY.com. \u201cI see people on FYP page all the time talking about how they can instantly tell when someone is from Utah or its culture because of how they look or dress.\u201d",
      "What does the trend say about beauty?",
      "Commentators have mixed opinions on what the viral moment says about beauty.",
      "Brand strategist Mara Dettman shared her perspective on the trend on her Substack, \"In Interesting Times.\" She wrote the idea of ranking someone based on attractiveness is \u201cinherently problematic.\u201d However, she also wrote that this trend takes ranking beauty and \u201cplays with it, critiques it, and perpetuates it, all at once.\u201d",
      "Dettmann tells TODAY.com this trend says anyone can be a \u201c10,\" as modern standards of beauty are defined by styling or charm and not physical traits.",
      "\u201cIt brings up really interesting questions about, when it comes to beauty: What\u2019s innate? What\u2019s performative?\u201d Dettmann says.",
      "Phelps also notes that the trend is nuanced.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always sort of a dangerous thing when we\u2019re ranking humans, and when we are creating hierarchies around bodies,\u201d Phelps said.",
      "She also touches on the agency and performance involved in this trend \u2014 people are bringing a cheeky self-awareness to beauty standards.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s less about how people embody a particular beauty standard and more so how they construct it, how they make it happen,\u201d Phelps adds.",
      "Dettmann says the regional aspect of the trend marks a shift away from one singular standard of beauty, best represented by Instagram face, the theory that all influencers and celebrities are starting to look the same due to similar cosmetic treatments.",
      "\u201cEven in the age of people being chronically online, regional culture and differences still matter,\u201d Dettmann says. \u201cIn a sea of sameness, we\u2019re getting more similar in some ways but also retaining unique differences.\u201d",
      "Additionally, some users who make fun of the trend reject the ranking mindset, Dettmann adds, by asking \u201cwhy do you even want to be a 10?\u201d",
      "TikToker Sam Puckett, for example, posted a video of herself transforming into her idea of a \"Texas 10 \"\u2014 the beaver mascot for the beloved Southern chain Buc-ees.",
      "\u201cYou can make anything or anyone a 10 if you fully commit and have the confidence,\u201d Puckett tells TODAY.com. \"My 10 for the trend is the Buc-ees Beaver and let me tell you he is getting hyped up in the comments.\u201d",
      "Phelps adds that humorous approaches make a statement on the idea of ranking beauty.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve found great about this as well is the way people are immediately putting humor into it and are responding in ways that are funny, resistant,\u201d Phelps says. \u201cThey\u2019re contradicting the trend at the same time that they\u2019re doing it.\u201d"

I was like, \u2018Can you remind me how I was?\u2019 And I listened to the music that I would listen to at the time.

I went, \u2018Really? Well, OK, when do we start?\u2019 It was just kind of magic right from the start, and here we are, 40 years later, the magic just keeps coming.\u201d",

And I absolutely loved it. And then by the end of the film, they\u2019re lifting me on top of their arms and carrying me off the court. So it was pretty trippy.\u201d",

I will always put them before myself,\" he said. \"The difficulty with shame is it\u2019s very difficult to heal when I wasn\u2019t just feeling my shame. I was feeling shame for them.\"",

      "During the Season 2 conclusion, out Aug. 6 on Apple TV+, all five American rebels \u2014 Nan (Kristine Fr\u00f8seth), Lizzy (Aubri Ibrag), Conchita (Alisha Boe), Mabel (Josie Totah) and Jinny (Imogen Waterhouse) \u2014 make surprising choices about their futures, setting up a possible Season 3 that would find them more fractured than they\u2019ve ever been.",
      "Although Season 1 and the current season highlighted the seemingly unbreakable bond between the five ladies as they tackled London\u2019s high society in the 1870s, the episodes leading up to the Season 2 finale hinted that tension between a couple of them would boil over. Prior to Nan\u2019s grand masquerade ball to mark the end of the season, she confronts Lizzy about a secret she has been keeping.",
      "When the party arrives, Conchita and Mabel form a business partnership that will help them conceal their financial struggles and sexuality, respectively. Then, Nan\u2019s husband, Theo, Duke of Tintagel (Guy Remmers), makes a stunning announcement to the guests that catches everyone off guard.",
      "Read on for a recap of the Season 2 finale, ominously titled \u201cShe Knows,\u201d and find out the fate of each member of the friend group. Plus, learn how a few \u201cBuccaneers\u201d stars reacted to the multiple revelations that were exposed.",
      "Conchita and Mabel",
      "Conchita, still grieving the death of her husband Richard (Josh Dylan) who was shot and killed by his brother Lord James Seadown (Barney Fishwick) in Episode 6, decided to attend the ball to show support for her friends.",
      "Throughout the season, Conchita and Richard discussed their limited funds and attempted to stabilize their finances by creating a matchmaking service.",
      "Meanwhile, Mabel spent most of the season learning to let go of her romantic relationship with Honoria (Mia Threapleton), who shared that she wanted to pursue a teaching career abroad. The two had an emotional breakup in Episode 5.",
      "In the finale, Mabel approaches Conchita with an idea at the party. She points out that flirting isn\u2019t easy \u201cfor people like me\u201d and that it is a struggle to find others like herself in rigid high society. Mabel says she wants to show gay men and women that love is possible. So, she suggests that she work with Conchita to turn her matchmaking operation into a business that brings gay people together. The scene ends with the two toasting to their new venture.",
      "Jinny, Guy and Paloma",
      "Jinny appears to be in better spirits after mending her friendship with Conchita following Richard\u2019s death. She prepares for the ball with Guy Thwarte (Matthew Broome) and Paloma Ballardino (Grace Ambrose), who are much more on edge.",
      "Earlier in the season, Guy and Paloma tied the knot after one drunken night together. Guy, who is still in love with Nan, is hoping that she will forgive him for the mistake. He is also waiting to receive papers confirming his marriage has been annulled. When Guy and Paloma arrive at the ball, it is revealed that Paloma is in possession of the annulment papers but she lies to Guy and says she doesn\u2019t have them yet.",
      "Paloma later runs into Nan and the two discuss Guy. Paloma explains their wedding happened one \u201ccrazy night\u201d and she doesn\u2019t remember most of it. But, she assures Nan that Guy loves her. Nan responds by thanking her for taking care of Jinny when she was in Italy and wishes her luck being \u201cMrs. Thwarte.\u201d",
      "Guy requests to speak to Nan and repeats how much he loves her. When he tries to kiss her as the clock strikes, she darts away and apologizes, leaving him alone.",
      "Lizzy and Hector",
      "The finale begins with Lizzy realizing that Nan knows about the affair between her and Theo. Lizzy immediately travels to the Tintagel estate to speak with Nan privately, although Theo attempts to intervene.",
      "Nan confronts Lizzy and calls her out for betraying her. Lizzy explains that she only let herself fall for Theo when she was certain that Nan didn\u2019t want to be with him anymore. But Lizzy says she will always choose her friend over him. Nan rejects this, adding that Lizzy hasn\u2019t been thinking about her the whole time.",
      "Lizzy then pushes back, accusing Nan of being sanctimonious, given that she was in a love triangle with Theo and Guy, his best friend. Nan counters that Lizzy isn\u2019t who the world thinks she is and everyone deserves to know \u201cthe truth\u201d before storming off.",
      "The next morning, newspapers are delivered around town with details about someone in Nan\u2019s \u201cclose circle\u201d having an affair with Theo. The article doesn\u2019t name Lizzy, but she instantly worries that rumors will ruin her reputation.",
      "Hector (Jacob Ifan) goes to visit Lizzy and despite being hurt he says he is interested in protecting her from the backlash. He offers to get engaged again, saying that the relationship would be mutually beneficial. She accepts his proposal.",
      "But at the ball, Hector\u2019s true intentions are revealed. His father, Reede Robinson (Greg Wise), approaches him and says he knows Hector is the one who leaked the information about the affair. \u201cCan you face yourself?\u201d Hector\u2019s father asks.",
      "Ifan speaks about his character\u2019s underhanded methods to reunite with Lizzy in an interview with TODAY.com, sharing that he was a fan of the twist.",
      "\u201cI think I was always sort of slightly pushing for him to have maybe a darker side or a slightly more sinister edge. I think just because (of) the nature of his job and the nature of ambition and the nature of wanting to be in power,\u201d he says.",
      "But he says he understands Hector\u2019s actions.",
      "Ifan continues, \u201cI think it generally came from a good place. I think he wanted to affect change, but I still think that there\u2019s something slightly Machiavellian belonging to anyone who lusts after (power).\u201d",
      "Ibrag tells TODAY.com that she agrees with that assessment of Hector\u2019s character. \u201cI feel like it came from a place of almost a wound,\u201d she explains. \u201cHe\u2019s not a malicious person \u2026 not like a Seadown.\u201d",
      "Ifan shares that he didn\u2019t learn that his character had a manipulative side to him until he received the script for the finale.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to discover something about your character that you didn\u2019t know. It shocked me, and therefore it made the whole journey seem more authentic. I was slightly disappointed in him, but as an actor, I thought it was a fun way to go,\u201d he says.",
      "Nan and Theo",
      "After Lizzy departs the estate, Nan gives Theo an ultimatum: either let her stay at the castle or she exposes the affair. He is confused as to why she would want to live with him and remain in a loveless marriage. He calls her a \u201cnobody\u201d and says she should leave.",
      "Nan writes to her mom, Patti St. George (Christina Hendricks), and asks her to meet in secret. She reveals that she is pregnant with the heir of Tintagel and is four months along. She becomes emotional as she worries Theo and his mom will take her baby. Patti and her come up with a plan: to publicly announce her pregnancy at the ball to catch Theo off guard and prevent his family from excluding her.",
      "But Theo is also plotting. At the ball, he asks Lizzy to not give up on him and says he is concocting a plan. When midnight arrives, he interrupts Nan\u2019s big moment to make a declaration of his own.",
      "He confirms that he and Nan have been living \u201ca lie\u201d for the last few months and that he does not love her. He says he wants to celebrate his true love, not keep it hidden.",
      "\u201cSo, from this moment forth, I renounce my title,\u201d he says, adding that he is abdicating his responsibilities to his duties and his wife.",
      "Theo says he and Nan will be getting a divorce. \u201cFrom this moment on, I am no longer a Duke, and Annabel St. George is no longer a duchess,\u201d he concludes as Nan walks away.",
      "Lizzy chases after her and the two argue again. Nan wonders how their friendship crumbled. She yells at Lizzy before letting it slip that she is pregnant. She asks Lizzy to keep her secret. Nan wishes Lizzy good luck lying to Theo and runs off. The last shot of the season shows Nan fleeing down the beach with a smile on her face.",
      "Fr\u00f8seth tells TODAY.com how she interprets Nan\u2019s feelings at that moment.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s freedom,\u201d she says before playfully adding, \u201cMaybe right after she stops running, she realizes, \u2018Where am I going to go?\u2019\u201d",
      "She continues, \u201cI\u2019m very excited to see where she is going to go and how she\u2019s going to raise this child. Is she going to go back? I really hope she stays by herself.\u201d",
      "Fr\u00f8seth says she joked with Hendricks that the two could raise Nan\u2019s baby in the countryside. Fr\u00f8seth then shares what she hopes to see from her character in a potential Season 3.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m being serious. I actually think that she should be by herself, and I was really proud of her when she made that decision,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a really courageous decision to leave things behind, but I think things have gotten so toxic within the friendships, within the men. There\u2019s so much happening and she\u2019s been making a lot of sacrifices and too many impulsive decisions. It\u2019s just time to get away.\u201d",
      "Who Is Theo\u2019s Brother?",
      "Theo\u2019s mom (Amelia Bullmore) speaks to Hector\u2019s dad, her longtime love, following Theo\u2019s speech. She says that she has worked to maintain Theo\u2019s title her entire life and she won\u2019t stop now. \u201cI can\u2019t allow it,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, I wrote to Kit.\u201d",
      "Kit is revealed to be Theo\u2019s brother, who was conceived from Theo\u2019s father\u2019s extramarital affair. Theo is unaware that his brother exists.",
      "\u201cKit is dangerous,\u201d Reede warns when he learns Kit is already on his way. The scene then cuts to a shot of Kit riding a horse toward the estate."

      "The Israeli announcement comes as the 2 million residents of Gaza, much of which has already been destroyed, are on the brink of famine, drawing international outrage. The threat of a new offensive in Gaza may be partly intended to pressure Hamas into a ceasefire on Israeli terms.",

      "In a statement to NBC News on Wednesday, the GHF, which operates four militarized food aid distribution sites across the enclave in areas where the Israeli military is active, said aid convoys belonging to the United Nations and other organizations in the past often passed near their locations and were regularly looted by large crowds.",
      "However, it said there were \u201cno incidents at or near\u201d their sites Tuesday. A spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) could not confirm whether its aid convoys had been looted near GHF sites.",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the casualties at Nasser Hospital.",
      "Farhat said other patients had told him they had been fired upon in another incident near Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah while seeking aid from a United Nations aid convoy that was passing through.",
      "An OCHA spokesperson did not have any details about the specific event, but said such incidents are not uncommon.",
      "Separately, the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Wednesday that 87 people had been killed and 570 injured in a series of incidents across the enclave Tuesday. A spokesperson for the ministry also said that Gaza hospitals had received the bodies of 49 people Wednesday and many of those killed were waiting for aid near U.S.-backed aid distribution points.",
      "Travis Melin, an anesthesiologist from Oregon who also volunteers at the Nasser Hospital, said the number of patients Tuesday had been \u201chuge.\u201d In a text message Wednesday, he added that he had seen the highest number of casualties at the hospital during his monthlong tenure there.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still doing emergency surgery on people who should have gone to the OR yesterday,\u201d he said.",
      "The \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201d is unfolding in the Gaza Strip under Israel\u2019s assault, the world\u2019s leading body on hunger said last week. Meanwhile, most of its residents have been driven from their homes and more than 61,000 killed, including thousands of children, according to local health officials. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage.",
      "Nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 injured while seeking food, the United Nations' OCHA said in an update Tuesday. \u201cAt least 859 people have been killed around GHF sites since the beginning of GHF\u2019s operations,\u201d it added."

      "HIROSHIMA, Japan \u2014 For more than half a century, chimes have rung out across the Japanese city of Hiroshima every morning at exactly 8:15.",
      "The solemn ritual marks the precise moment Aug. 6, 1945, when the U.S. bomber Enola Gay dropped the world\u2019s first atomic bomb over Hiroshima, killing about 70,000 people instantly.",
      "On Wednesday, people in Hiroshima commemorated the 80th anniversary of the devastating attack, as nuclear fears mount globally amid unresolved military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "In a one-minute silent tribute, the city remembered the widescale death and destruction caused by the 10,000-pound bomb, which created a huge mushroom cloud that rose to more than 60,000 feet.",
      "\u201cIt is our duty to convey the reality of the atomic bombings not only to the people of Japan but also to the people of the world,\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said in a speech.",
      "Initially meant to strike a T-shaped bridge, the bomb veered instead toward an exhibition hall with a distinctive dome, which after the explosion was the only building still standing within a 1-mile radius.",
      "The blast unleashed a whirlwind of fire and force, incinerating thousands of people. Then came the radioactive black rain, which fell over the city, silently poisoning countless more.",
      "Teruko Yahata was 8 years old at the time.",
      "Yahata, who is now in her 80s, says she still has a scar from when she was hurled by the blast. Fearing another bomb, she huddled under a blanket with her family.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really understand what it meant to die,\u201d Yahata said, \u201cbut the warmth I felt at us dying together \u2026 I still remember to this day.\u201d",
      "Three days after bombing Hiroshima, the U.S. unleashed a second atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki that killed another 40,000 people immediately.",
      "The unprecedented bombings hastened Imperial Japan\u2019s surrender and the end of World War II, most historians say, though at the price of nearly a quarter-million lives.",
      "From the ashes, Hiroshima was rebuilt into a busy city of more than a million people, drawing tourists from around the world.",
      "Near the hypocenter, where the bomb detonated about 2,000 feet above, is a peace memorial park and museum that includes the iconic atomic dome. Using virtual reality headsets, visitors can immerse themselves in the bombing and its brutal aftermath while touring the park.",
      "Yet, the bombing still feels visceral to Hiroshima survivors, who are called hibakusha, or \u201cbomb affected persons.\u201d Now more than 86 years old on average, they have spent most of their lives struggling with illness, depression and discrimination.",
      "Kunihiko Iida, whose father was killed in the war and whose mother and older sister died shortly after the bombing, is now 83, defying predictions that he would not live to the age of 20.",
      "Those who say the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki saved lives, he said, \u201cdon\u2019t know the reality of a nuclear bomb.\u201d",
      "Last year, the work of Japanese survivors\u2019 group Nihon Hidankyo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "Toshiyuki Mimaki, the group\u2019s co-chair, is among those advocating nuclear disarmament and making sure that Hiroshima is neither forgotten nor repeated.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a very dangerous situation with Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cEven a single nuclear bomb would mean disaster.\u201d",
      "According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), the world\u2019s nine nuclear-armed states \u2014 Russia, the United States, China, France, Britain, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea \u2014 spent more than $100 billion on nuclear weapons last year, up 11% from 2023.",
      "The increase in spending on nuclear weapons contrasts with public attitudes about them. In a June survey of Americans by the Pew Research Center, 69% of respondents said the development of nuclear weapons had made the world less safe, compared with 10% who said it had made the world safer.",
      "Nearly 70% of Japan\u2019s atomic bomb survivors believe nuclear weapons could be used again, according to a poll this year by Japanese news agency Kyodo News.",
      "Hiroshima survivor Setsuko Thurlow, 93, lost 10 members of her family in the bombing. She said she remembered seeing a procession of people fleeing to the hillside who \u201clooked like ghosts.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s hair was just standing up, raised upwards, and the skin and the flesh was coming off from the bones,\u201d she said.",
      "Thurlow, who went to the U.S. to study in 1954 \u2014 the same year the U.S. tested a hydrogen bomb 1,000 times more powerful than the one that destroyed Hiroshima \u2014 has spent her life campaigning for nuclear disarmament, accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 on behalf of ICAN.",
      "\u201cI beg world leaders to stop and come to the negotiation table. Diplomacy needs to have greater attention,\u201d she said in a video interview from Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s not nuclear weapons, but diplomacy, exchange of words and ideas.\u201d",
      "The number of hibakusha is dwindling, raising fears that living memory of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings will soon be gone. As of the end of March, there were 99,130 survivors nationwide, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.",
      "Responsibility for remembering is being taken up by young people such as 12-year-old Shun Sasaki, who has been giving foreign visitors free guided tours of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park since he was 7.",
      "Sasaki said that even though his great-grandmother was among those killed in the bombing, for a long time his family barely acknowledged it.",
      "\u201cThe scariest thing that might happen in the future is to forget what happened a long time ago,\u201d Sasaki said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to have the same experience as my great-grandmother.\u201d",
      "Sasaki\u2019s is not the only family that has avoided talking about that day. More than 70% of the respondents in the Kyodo poll said they had never spoken about their experiences.",
      "Even so, some feel it is their duty to speak up.",
      "\u201cAs long as I live, I want to continue telling,\u201d Yahata said. \u201cI\u2019m a survivor.\u201d",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer and Mai Nishiyama reported from Hiroshima, Arata Yamamoto from Tokyo, Michael Fiorentino from London and Peter Guo from Hong Kong."

While thrilling for the influencers and their followers, critics accuse these carefully edited travelogues of whitewashing the harsh realities of life in Afghanistan, particularly for women, and rehabilitating the country\u2019s autocratic rulers.",

      "The Taliban has effectively barred Afghan women from many aspects of public life, including access to education and jobs. In July, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for two of the Taliban\u2019s top leaders, accusing them of persecuting women and girls in Afghanistan, which the group dismissed.",
      "Influencers continue to go to Afghanistan despite clear warnings from the U.S. State Department that Americans should not travel to the country \u201cfor any reason\u201d and that \u201cthere is a risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals.\u201d",
      "The European Union and Britain have issued similar travel advisories, while none of these countries have operational embassies in Afghanistan, limiting the provision of consular assistance to citizens."

      "But U.S. relations with India have instead come under strain over trade and other issues. Trump has threatened Apple and other companies that manufacture in India; moved closer to its biggest rival, Pakistan; and mocked India\u2019s \u201cdead\u201d economy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s threatening to undo, or at least hit pause on, what has been two decades of steadily improving relations between India and the U.S.,\u201d said Dhruva Jaishankar, executive director of the Observer Research Foundation America, a nonprofit group in Washington.",
      "On Monday, citing India\u2019s \u201cmassive\u201d purchases of Russian oil, Trump said he would \u201csubstantially\u201d increase the U.S. tariff on Indian imports, which is already one of the highest among Asian countries at 25%. Along with China, India is a top purchaser of Russian crude oil sanctioned by Western governments after Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "In a sharp response, India, a major U.S. security partner, said such criticism was \u201cunjustified and unreasonable\u201d and that it bought Russian oil with U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIndia began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,\u201d the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets stability.\u201d",

      "The bonhomie did not last long. Since then, Trump has needled India over a number of issues, including billions in investment by American companies as they shift manufacturing from China.",
      "Last quarter, India produced 44% of U.S. smartphone imports, more than any other country, including China, according to data from the research firm Canalys.

      "Within weeks, Trump hosted Pakistan\u2019s powerful army chief at the White House in an unprecedented meeting. He has also imposed a lower tariff rate on Pakistan of 19% and said the U.S. had reached a deal with Pakistan on exploring its oil reserves.",
      "Squeezed over Russia",
      "As Trump has expressed growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he has turned his attention to India\u2019s relationship with Moscow.",
      "For years, New Delhi has benefited from its \u201cnonaligned\u201d foreign policy, which allowed India to strengthen U.S. ties while continuing its long-standing relationship with Russia, one of its main suppliers of energy and military equipment.",
      "When Russian oil was hit with Western-led sanctions over Ukraine, India \u2014 the third-largest energy consumer in the world after China and the U.S. \u2014 seized the opportunity to buy it at a discount, which even U.S. officials said helped stabilize global oil prices.",

During a meeting of their foreign ministers in Beijing last month, India and China agreed to resume direct flights between their countries for the first time in five years.",
      "Despite the recent setbacks in their relationship, India will continue to engage with the U.S. as a key strategic and technological partner, said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",

      "After months of delays and extensions, President Donald Trump\u2019s comprehensive and sweeping tariffs slate took effect Thursday just after midnight ET, shifting his global trade reset into high gear.",
      "Most imports into the United States will now face a baseline 10% duty, with the overall average effective tariff rate rising to more than 17% \u2014 the highest since 1935, during the Great Depression \u2014 thanks to higher duties on some of the biggest U.S. trading partners, according to the nonpartisan Yale Budget Lab think tank.",
      "A wide variety of products will be hit. Tariffs will be collected on everything from European Union appliances and Japanese cars to food, furniture and toys from China and TVs from South Korea. Selected oil and gas imports, along with some smartphones and a suite of goods covered by a pre-existing trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, are not affected.",
      "Together, the duties are the most significant move yet by a president set on tilting the global economy even more in favor of the United States.",
      "Trump was online to celebrate the moment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s midnight! Billions of dollars in tariffs are now flowing into the United States of America!\u201d he said in an all-caps post on Truth Social.",
      "So far, the duties have mainly been jostling the U.S. economy instead. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports collected by the federal government, generally tend to raise costs, although there is some debate among economists about whether businesses or consumers ultimately bear the weight of those increased prices.",
      "Yale\u2019s Budget Lab calculates that the inflationary effect of tariffs will cost a typical household an average of as much as $2,400 this year. It forecasts one of the biggest impacts in clothing, with consumers facing 40% higher prices for shoes and 38% higher costs for apparel in the short run as retailers that rely on importing clothes from South and Southeast Asia shift supply chains or grapple with higher costs.",
      "Global markets largely shrugged off the new tariffs, with European and Asian shares mostly higher on Thursday, CNBC reported. U.S. stock futures were also up slightly.",
      "But Thursday is not the end of Trump\u2019s trade offensive.",
      "Trump told CNBC on Tuesday he still plans to impose import taxes on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Currently, only about a quarter of manufacturing facilities supplying the United States with key drug ingredients are actually based here, equating to a $116 billion deficit with the rest of the world. As for semiconductors, the United States imports $40 billion worth, though the figure can also include chips produced in the United States, shipped abroad and repackaged inside finished goods.",
      "Trump has also shown continued willingness to ratchet up duty levels at a moment\u2019s notice. On Wednesday, he hiked the tariff rate for India to 50% over the nation\u2019s purchases of Russian oil, which he said was allowing Russia to continue to finance its war in Ukraine. Brazil, too, now faces 50% duties as a result of Trump\u2019s displeasure with its treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who has been detained on coup charges.",
      "Trump also told CNBC he could raise the European Union\u2019s tariff level to 35% from 15% if it reneges on an investment commitment. Taken together, the 27-nation bloc is the largest U.S. trading partner.",
      "The Trump administration continues to insist tariffs are working, pointing to billions raised in new monthly revenues for the U.S. government. The White House also notes that nations have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, though no details about how that money will be spent have been released. Stock indexes have also set all-time highs.",
      "\u201cThe markets have seen what we\u2019re doing and celebrated,\u201d Kevin Hassett, director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Market analysts say those gains have been largely driven by tech and bets on artificial intelligence, offsetting growing signs of weakness elsewhere, like a slowing labor market and softer consumer spending."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Police in southwestern China scuffled this week with protesters demanding greater justice for a 14-year-old girl bullied by her schoolmates, the latest in a series of such incidents that have drawn national attention.",
      "The unusual public outrage was set off by videos widely shared on Chinese social media showing a group of teenage girls verbally and physically attacking the victim in Jiangyou, a city in Sichuan province.",
      "Local residents, some of whom were spurred by what authorities said were false reports that the alleged attackers\u2019 families had official ties, have faced off with police they accuse of letting them off too lightly.",
      "\u201cYour children will meet children of officials who are more senior than you. What if they beat your children?\u201d a man said from behind a barricade in a video verified by NBC News.",
      "Other verified videos, many of which Chinese censors swiftly took down, showed a large crowd gathered in Jiangyou on Monday night, at times singing the Chinese national anthem as the police presence grew. Some people could be seen struggling with police officers on the ground before being taken away.",
      "Reached by phone Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Sichuan Public Security Department declined to comment and referred to earlier statements.",
      "Local police in Jiangyou said the incident took place July 22, when a 15-year-old girl surnamed Liu and two others, ages 13 and 14, assaulted the 14-year-old victim, surnamed Lai, in a vacant building. Bystanders recorded the incident and uploaded it online, police said in a statement Monday.",
      "The assault caused multiple contusions to Lai\u2019s scalp and knees, police said, though all injuries were \u201cminor.\u201d After an investigation, authorities \u201cpromptly\u201d expressed sympathy for the victim and took action, the statement said.",
      "Liu and another alleged perpetrator, who were subject to \u201cpublic security penalties,\u201d are being sent to a special school for corrective education, the police said, while the remaining bystanders were \u201ccriticized and educated.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear what exactly the punishment entails and why one of the three alleged abusers was not penalized. Under Chinese law, anyone who engages in severe group fighting can be detained for up to 15 days and fined up to 1,000 yuan ($139), but juvenile offenders are exempted from detention and sent for corrective education, instead.",
      "Cyber police in the city of Mianyang, which administers Jiangyou, said in a statement Tuesday that the parents of the three alleged attackers were not lawyers or police officers but that \u201ctwo are unemployed, two work outside the province, one is a local shop assistant, and one is a local food delivery worker.\u201d",
      "They said two internet users accused of posting the false information had been \u201cadministratively punished.\u201d",
      "The attack has been widely discussed on Chinese social media, where commenters expressed anger over what they considered relatively light penalties.",
      "\u201cOnly a heavy penalty can serve as a warning,\u201d a user wrote on the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo. \u201cThis is really abhorrent.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s truly infuriating and heartbreaking,\u201d another said. \u201cIf such behaviors go unpunished, we will eventually pay a heavy price.\u201d",
      "More than 50% of Chinese students have endured school bullying, including verbal abuse, social exclusion and threats of violence, according to a recent survey by the state-backed China Youth & Children Research Center.",
      "The issue of bullying has been getting more attention in China after several high-profile cases.",
      "In January, violent protests erupted in the northwestern province of Shaanxi over a teenage student who fell to his death at a vocational school after a \u201cverbal and physical altercation\u201d with another student. Investigators ruled out any crime.",
      "In December, a Chinese court in the northern province of Hebei sentenced a teenager to life imprisonment and another to 12 years over the murder of their 13-year-old schoolmate, who was buried in an abandoned greenhouse after being killed by a shovel.",
      "A third suspect, who like the others was 13 at the time of the crime, was sentenced to corrective education.",
      "Chinese authorities acknowledge that some minors take advantage of the lower penalties generally available for those under 16 and commit multiple offenses before that age, state-run broadcaster CCTV News reported in June.",
      "The country\u2019s top legislature passed an amendment that month that would allow minors ages 14 to 16 to be detained over \u201cserious and harmful\u201d offenses starting next year."

      "France\u2019s biggest wildfire in years was spreading quickly Wednesday in a Mediterranean region near Spain after leaving one person dead and several injured, authorities said. The fire burned an area larger than Paris, and the military was called in to help.",
      "French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou deplored a \u201cdisaster on an unprecedented scale\u201d in the region.",
      "Over 2,100 firefighters and several water bomber aircraft battled the blaze that broke out Tuesday afternoon in the village of Ribaute in the Aude region, a rural, wooded area that is home to wineries.",
      "The fire, which has burned 39,500 acres, remained \u201cvery active\u201d on Wednesday and continued to progress as night fell, the local administration said. The weather was hot, dry and windy, making it difficult for firefighters to contain the blaze.",
      "Villagers sought to help douse the flames or save their homes and small businesses, and described their alarm at the fire\u2019s speed. Ash filled the air and coated windows and cars, and several roads were closed around the region.",
      "\u201cThe sky was blue, and then less than an hour later the sky was orange,\u201d said Andy Pickup of Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse, at the heart of the fire zone. \u201cThat\u2019s when we went out and tried to help.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe heard pops and cracks \u2014 it was the trees, it was the village,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cWe could see the fires taking hold on all the hills around Saint-Laurent.\u201d At dusk, he said, they saw fires in every direction, some as near as 100 yards away.",
      "Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said the military will reinforce efforts starting from Thursday, with several dozen soldiers to be deployed.",
      "One person died in their home, and at least 13 others were injured, including 11 firefighters, local authorities said. Three people were missing, the prefecture said.",
      "Jacques Piraux, mayor of the village of Jonqui\u00e8res, said all residents have been evacuated.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a scene of sadness and desolation,\u201d he told broadcaster BFM TV after visiting there on Wednesday morning. \u201cIt looks like a lunar landscape, everything is burned. More than half or three-quarters of the village has burned down. It\u2019s hellish.\u201d",
      "Residents and tourists in nearby areas were requested to remain in their homes unless told to evacuate. Two campgrounds were evacuated as a precaution.",
      "The prime minister met Wednesday afternoon with firefighters and residents at Saint-Laurent-de-la-Cabrerisse, where the fire service\u2019s command post has been set up. He said he came to express \u201cnational solidarity.\u201d",
      "The area\u2019s economy is relying on winery and tourism and \u201cboth sectors are affected,\u201d he stressed.",
      "Bayrou said an investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the fire.",
      "The environment ministry said the Aude region has been experiencing a drought this month, with water use restrictions in place. Lack of rainfall in recent months \u201cplayed a major role in the spreading of the fire, since the vegetation is very dry,\u201d the statement said.",
      "This week\u2019s fire was the biggest since the creation of a national fire database in 2006, according to the national emergency service.",
      "Southern Europe has seen multiple large fires this summer. Scientists warn that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness, making the region more vulnerable to wildfires. Last month, a wildfire that reached the southern port of Marseille, France\u2019s second-largest city, left around 300 people injured.",
      "Europe is the world\u2019s fastest-warming continent, with temperatures increasing at twice the speed of the global average since the 1980s, according to the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lived here for 10 years and we\u2019ve seen nothing like that,\u2019\u2019 Pickup said. \u2018\u2019Consistently the summers are getting hotter, there is less and less rain, and that is a major problem.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cWe have been told the wind might come stronger tomorrow,\u2019\u2019 he added."

      "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers have \u201cweaponized\u201d the legal and judicial system to oppress women and girls in what amounts to \u201ccrimes against humanity,\u201d the independent U.N. investigator on human rights in the country said.",
      "Richard Bennett said in a report to the U.N. General Assembly circulated Wednesday that after seizing power in 2021 the Taliban suspended the 2004 constitution and laws protecting the rights of women and girls. These include a landmark law that criminalized 22 forms of violence against women, including rape and child and forced marriage.",
      "The Taliban dismissed all judges under the previous U.S.-backed government, including approximately 270 women, replacing them with men who share their extreme Islamic views, lack legal training and hand down decisions based on edicts issued by the Taliban, he said.",
      "In addition, he noted that the Taliban have assumed full control over law enforcement and investigative agencies, systematically purging Afghans who worked for the previous government.",
      "Bennett, who was appointed by the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council, focused on access to justice and protection for women and girls in his report. He said he held meetings, focus-group discussions and one-on-one interviews with more that 110 Afghans inside and outside the country. He did so remotely because the Taliban have refused to grant him a visa to travel to Afghanistan.",
      "Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, their crackdown on women and girls has been widely reported and globally denounced.",
      "Taliban leaders have barred education for women and girls beyond sixth grade, banned most employment, and prohibited women from many public spaces, including parks, gyms and hairdressers. New laws ban women\u2019s voices and bare faces outside the home.",
      "The Taliban remain isolated from the West because of their restrictions on women and girls and have only been recognized by Russia.",
      "Bennett said the Taliban did not respond to an advance copy of the report and a request for information about their efforts to ensure access to justice and protection for women and girls.",
      "The Taliban defend their approach to justice by claiming they are implementing Islamic sharia law, but Islamic scholars and others have said their interpretation is unparalleled in other Muslim-majority countries and does not adhere to Islamic teachings. They say protecting the legal rights of women is a priority.",
      "Bennett said, however, that women have virtually no rights.",
      "\u201cToday, there are no women judges or prosecutors and no officially registered female lawyers, leaving women and girls with fewer safe channels to report abuse or seek redress,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCoupled with a lack of female officials in the police and other institutions, the result is widespread underreporting of violence and discrimination against women and girls.\u201d",
      "Bennett said access to justice for girls \u201cis further undermined by the dismantling of key legal safeguards and institutions protecting the rights of children,\u201d including juvenile courts and juvenile rehabilitation centers.",
      "The Taliban requirement that a woman must be accompanied by a male relative also creates barriers to filing complaints and attending court proceedings, he said, and disproportionately affects widows, women who are the heads of their households, the displaced and disabled.",
      "\u201cWomen who engage with the Taliban court system \u2014 whether as victims seeking redress, to resolve family issues, to obtain official documents or as alleged offenders \u2014 face a hostile environment,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cCourts often reject complaints made by women and are especially reluctant to accept cases relating to divorce, child custody and gender-based violence.\u201d",
      "Facing these obstacles, Bennett said, women increasingly turn to traditional and informal justice mechanisms, including formal jirgas and shuras \u2014 community councils of elders \u2014 and informal mediation by religious leaders, community elders or family. But these are all male-dominated and raise \u201cserious concerns about the rights of women and girls,\u201d he said.",
      "He said international forums offer the best hope for justice. He pointed to the International Criminal Court\u2019s request on Jan. 23 for arrest warrants for two senior Taliban leaders accused of crimes against humanity for persecution \u201con gender grounds.\u201d And he urged all countries to support efforts to bring Afghanistan before the International Court of Justice, the U.N.\u2019s highest tribunal, for violating the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women."

      "The commission opened a review of Sentebale\u2019s governance in April after the two princes stepped down as patrons and a group of trustees, saying the relationship between the board and its chair, Sophie Chandauka, was beyond repair.

      "The post echoed a similar appeal that appeared on the zoo's website earlier this year, which also called for horses to be donated so long as they were no taller than 4 feet 10 inches, healthy and not treated for illness in the past 30 days.",
      "Horse owners can obtain a tax deduction for the value of the animal, it said.",
      "Zoos have a \u201cresponsibility to imitate the natural food chain\u201d for carnivores that need whole prey for a hunting experience similar to that in the wild, the post said.",
      "\u201cIf you have a healthy animal that has to leave here for various reasons, feel free to donate it to us,\u201d it added. \u201cWe ensure natural behavior, nutrition and well-being of our predators.\u201d",
      "The post quickly sparked online debate drawing criticism from some quarters.",
      "\u201cThe idea that a zoo, of all places, is encouraging people to drop off their animals to be killed and fed to lions and tigers is, to me, incredibly disturbing,\u201d one user wrote on Facebook.",
      "Aalborg Zoo has been feeding its carnivores smaller livestock for many years, deputy director Pia Nielsen said, \u201cto give them as natural a diet as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cTherefore, it makes sense to allow animals that need to be euthanized for various reasons to be of use in this way,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cIn Denmark, this practice is common, and many of our guests and partners appreciate the opportunity to contribute.\u201d",
      "In an update to its original post Tuesday, the zoo said it had closed the comments section.",
      "\u201cWe understand that the post arouses emotions and interest, but hateful and malicious rhetoric is not necessary \u2014 and we encourage everyone to maintain a respectful tone,\u201d the zoo wrote.",
      "It is not unheard of for animals to be fed to predators after they have died in a zoo or culled from healthy animal populations.",
      "In 2014, Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark's capital courted controversy when it killed an 18-month-old giraffe called Marius with a bolt gun and fed him to the lions, saying the animal was \u201cunwanted.\u201d",
      "An online petition with thousands of signatures failed to save him and the zoo said at the time that Marius had been euthanized to avoid inbreeding."

      "BRUSSELS \u2014 NATO has started coordinating regular deliveries of large weapons packages to Ukraine after the Netherlands said it would provide air defense equipment, ammunition and other military aid worth 500 million euros ($578 million).",
      "Sweden also announced Tuesday it would contribute $275 million to a joint effort along with its Nordic neighbors Denmark and Norway to provide $500 million worth of air defenses, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and spare parts.",
      "Two deliveries of equipment, most of it bought in the United States, are expected this month, although the Nordic package is expected to arrive in September. The equipment is supplied based on Ukraine\u2019s priority needs on the battlefield. NATO allies then locate the weapons and ammunition and send them on.",
      "\u201cPackages will be prepared rapidly and issued on a regular basis,\u201d NATO said Monday.",
      "Air defense systems are in greatest need. The United Nations has said that Russia\u2019s relentless pounding of urban areas behind the front line has killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians.",
      "Russia\u2019s bigger army is also making slow but costly progress along the 620-mile front line. Currently, it is waging an operation to take the eastern city of Pokrovsk, a logistical hub whose fall could allow it to drive deeper into Ukraine.",
      "European allies and Canada are buying most of the equipment they plan to send from the United States, which has greater stocks of ready military materiel, as well as more effective weapons. The Trump administration is not giving any arms to Ukraine.",
      "The new deliveries will come on top of other pledges of military equipment.",
      "The Kiel Institute, which tracks support to Ukraine, estimates that as of June, European countries had provided 72 billion euros ($83 billion) worth of military aid since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, compared to $65 billion in U.S. aid.",
      "Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said that \u201cAmerican air defense systems and munitions, in particular, are crucial for Ukraine to defend itself.\u201d Announcing the deliveries Monday, he said Russia\u2019s attacks are \u201cpure terror, intended to break Ukraine.\u201d",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude to the Netherlands, posting on social media that \u201cUkraine, and thus the whole of Europe, will be better protected from Russian terror.\u201d",
      "He said the deliveries are coming \u201cat a time when Russia is trying to scale up its strikes. This will definitely help protect the lives of our people!\u201d",
      "Germany said Friday it will deliver two more Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine in the coming days. It agreed to the move after securing assurances that the U.S. will prioritize the delivery of new Patriots to Germany to backfill its stocks. These weapon systems are only made in the U.S.",
      "As an organization, NATO provides only non-lethal assistance to Ukraine like uniforms, tents, medical supplies and logistics support. The 32-nation military alliance has mostly sought to protect NATO territory from possible Russian attack and avoid being dragged into a war against a nuclear power.",
      "But its support role has expanded since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January, even as his administration insists European allies must now take care of their own security and that of their war-ravaged neighbor. Trump has made no public promise of weapons or economic support for Ukraine.",
      "Trump said on July 28 that the U.S. is \u201cgoing to be sending now military equipment and other equipment to NATO, and they\u2019ll be doing what they want, but I guess it\u2019s for the most part working with Ukraine.\u201d"
