      "Snaking traffic, screaming crowds, and a crush of photographers descended on the Grand Palais as Chanel unveiled its final collection before Matthieu Blazy\u2019s highly anticipated debut as creative director",
      "PARIS -- Snaking traffic, screaming crowds, and a crush of photographers descended on the Grand Palais on Tuesday as Chanel unveiled its final collection before Matthieu Blazy\u2019s highly anticipated debut as creative director. Kylie Jenner led a constellation of stars, seated atop two giant interlocking C\u2019s raised like a bridge \u2014 perhaps a metaphor for the house\u2019s transition to its bold new chapter.",
      "Critics expecting an underwhelming, designer-less show were swiftly proven wrong. Chanel\u2019s studio punched above its weight, delivering a collection of striking hues and diverse designs showcasing its couture ateliers\u2019 unrivaled artistry.",
      "For a designer famous for revolutionizing fashion with the use of black, this collection went against the grain. Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel\u2019s lesser-known talent as a colorist took center stage, with joyful pastels, bold tones, midnight blue, and classic black following a complete cycle from day to night \u2014 something like a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d collection on the eve of the reboot.",
      "The runway pieces struck a balance between whimsy and drama. Beyond the house's bread-and-butter tweed skirt suits, leg-of-mutton sleeves brought historical grandeur, evoking a sense of Victorian elegance. Sequins and paillettes shimmered under the bring Grand Palais light. Silk trains in bold red injected a sense of drama. Playful neckties hinted at a 1970s influence.",
      "A standout piece was a satin pastel yellow gown with delicate buttons running down the front, exuding the glamour of old Hollywood while maintaining a fresh feel.",
      "But the devil at Chanel couture is in the detail \u2014 the buttons.",
      "Buttons in rock crystal, metal, and rhinestone ones adorned jackets, skirts, and dresses, adding a quiet brilliance to the vibrant collection.",
      "The audience was a testament to Chanel\u2019s unmatched global power, boasting one of the most prestigious guestlists of Paris Fashion Week. And not just Kylie Jenner perched atop the double-C decor.",
      "Global ambassadors Jennie, the K-pop superstar from BLACKPINK, G-Dragon, and Lily-Rose Depp sat alongside Dua Lipa, Marion Cotillard, and actresses Elsa Zylberstein and Antonia Desplat.",
      "Among the star-studded crowd, Pamela Anderson, who's been seen at shows all week was flanked by teams of menacing security guards.",
      "The chatter centered on the maison\u2019s impending creative shift. Virginie Viard, who succeeded Karl Lagerfeld in 2019, parted ways with Chanel last year following tepid reviews. One guest Tuesday summed up the mood bluntly: \u201cEven the studio show seems better than what Viard did,\u201d capturing the widespread belief that Chanel needed fresh vision.",
      "Blazy, who arrives with a reputation for craftsmanship and innovation. Most recently, he was creative director at Bottega Veneta.",
      "He reportedly inherits a maison in robust financial health, providing a solid foundation for his ambitious vision.",
      "Despite the mixed reception, under Viard's tenure, Chanel saw record sales, with revenue reaching a reported $19.7 billion in 2023, including a 23% increase in ready-to-wear sales.",
      "As Chanel couture celebrates its 110th anniversary, the house released a special film giving an insider\u2019s look at its iconic Rue Cambon headquarters. Featuring Vanessa Paradis, Marion Cotillard, and Naomi Campbell, the film delves into the intricacies of couture craftsmanship.",
      "\u201cAt Chanel, we take a minimum of 25-30 measurements,\u201d one seamstress revealed, showcasing how some garments require thousands of hours of meticulous handcrafting. Through intimate interviews with \u201cles petites mains,\u201d the film highlighted the dedication that defines Chanel as a benchmark of couture excellence."

    "story": [
      "The Grammys will look a little bit different this year",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Grammy Awards will look a little bit different this week.",
      "Each year, the Recording Academy hosts a multitude of events to welcome the music industry during Grammy week and record labels do the same. However, many institutions have canceled their plans \u2014 Universal Music Group, Sony, Spotify, BMG and Warner Music Group among them \u2014 and instead are allocating resources to help those affected by the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.",
      "The Grammys will still take place on Sunday at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles but now will focus its attention on helping wildfire victims.",
      "Within days of fires ravaging the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods, the Recording Academy and its affiliated MusiCares charity launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort with a $1 million dollar donation. According to a letter sent to members on Jan. 13, thanks to additional contributions, they\u2019ve already distributed $2 million in emergency aid.",
      "Once the fund was set up, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. said they began focusing on reformatting what Grammy week would look like \u2014 many conversations conducted \u201con the road, mobile-y, virtually\u201d as staffers had evacuated their homes.",
      "\u201cThat process has really consisted of reaching out to just listen and learn from a lot of people \u2014 state officials, local officials, the governor\u2019s office, the mayor\u2019s office, the fire department. We talked to hotel managers, just really trying to get a grasp on what was happening currently. What did they project was going to happen in the next week to 10 days? Would be safe to have a show?\"",
      "Ultimately, the Recording Academy decided to condense its pre-Grammy week plans to just four events, each featuring a fundraising element.",
      "On Friday, MusiCares, an organization that helps music professionals who need financial, personal or medical assistance, will hold its annual Persons of the Year benefit gala\u2009celebrating the Grateful Dead.",
      "On Saturday, the Special Merit Awards Ceremony and Grammy nominees' reception will still take place, followed by Clive Davis' pre-Grammy fundraising event.",
      "Then the Grammys take the stage on Sunday.",
      "Events like the annual pre-Grammy Black Music Collective event, Grammy advocacy brunch, and others scheduled to take place at the immersive pop-up Grammy house have been canceled.",
      "\u201cWe thought consolidating the events would allow us to have more impact,\u201d Mason explains. \u201cAnd we just don\u2019t feel it was the right time to have social gatherings or places to party or schmooze and just hang out. We wanted to have our events be places that could be purposeful and impactful. Some of the party settings, we decided to fold down into our fundraising efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously, we can\u2019t have a normal show in the midst of people\u2019s belongings being burned or loss of life or other things like that. At the same time, canceling would not have helped,\u201d Mason says.",
      "\u201cWe needed to raise money. We needed to show unity and come together around music. We need to support the city of L.A. (Over) 6,500 people work on our shows and ancillary gatherings. So, once we decided to move forward, it was really a conversation with (Grammy producers) Ben Winston, Raj Kapoor and Jesse Collins and myself. And we started to think about, \u2018How do we make the show have the greatest impact?\u2019\u201d",
      "They decided the path forward was to still give out awards and host performances to give viewers and attendees a bespoke concert experience. But most importantly, the show could raise awareness, drive donations and resources to funds that benefit people in need.",
      "And the conversations are ongoing. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\" he assures. \"It will honor some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d",
      "Don't expect a traditional telethon, but he says the show will feature announcements and activations in the arena.",
      "\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be talking about things that have been pledged from the sponsors or from the community,\u201d he adds.",
      "\u201cWe know right off the bat that we\u2019ve got almost 3,000 requests for help from our members or people in the music community,\u201d Mason says. \u201cSo that was just in the first few days.\u201d",
      "The immediate needs have been \u201cthe basics,\u201d as he explains. \u201cFood, water, shelter, the bare necessities to live.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe next phase will involve, you know, where they\u2019re going to live, how are they going to replace maybe damaged or destroyed instruments, studios. How will they make a living? I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some mental health component that people may need assistance with. But it\u2019s really across the board. But the early, immediate relief is around just the bare necessities.\u201d",
      "There's no shortage of natural disasters, and they affect the music community too. Mason brings up the COVID-19 pandemic as a recent example. With MusiCares, they were able to contribute \u201cover $40 million to people who needed help.\u201d They have the infrastructure to provide assistance quickly.",
      "However, he notes, the Grammys are the first major award show taking place after the wildfires, which means \u201cthere's no playbook for this.\"",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019ve always said it all changes if the fires were to continue, or possibly got worse, or the winds changed. So, I always want to reserve that right. We\u2019re not going to go blindly forward if things are unsafe or if it feels inappropriate,\" he says.",
      "But consider the fundraising, the economic and financial impacts, and the possibility of unity, \u201cIt all makes sense for us to move forward.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has set a March 2026 trial date for actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni to resolve their claims stemming from their work on the movie \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- A New York judge set a March 2026 trial date on Monday and moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week as the public feud between Blake Lively and her \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d costar and director Justin Baldoni continued to grow and accelerate.",
      "And in a new and separate front in the series of legal battles surrounding the film that became a surprise hit last summer, Lively in a Texas court filed a request for a deposition of a man she says was central to turning online sentiment against her during its release and promotion.",
      "The New York federal judge, Lewis J. Liman, told both sides in an order late Monday to prepare for a March 9, 2026, trial.",
      "He also moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week and told lawyers to be prepared to address complaints about pretrial publicity and attorney conduct.",
      "Liman took the actions after Lively\u2019s lawyers claimed in a filing on Monday that an attorney for Baldoni was trying to taint potential jurors over lawsuits the actors have filed against each other.",
      "The lawyers said Baldoni\u2019s attorney was trying to wreck Lively\u2019s career and turn potential New York jurors against her by creating a website to release selected documents and communications between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "The lawyers said attorney Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni, was \u201cengaging in this extrajudicial campaign to influence these proceedings and the public perception of legal filings to this Court, and there already is a serious risk that his misconduct is tainting the jury pool.\u201d",
      "They added: \u201cThe endless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements must end.\u201d",
      "Freedman said in a statement in response to Monday's assertions that the \u201cirony is not lost on anyone that Ms. Lively is so petrified of the truth that she has moved to gag it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will always respect the court; however, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cAll we want is for people to see the actual text messages that directly contradict her allegations, video footage that clearly shows there was no sexual harassment and all the other powerful evidence that directly contradicts any false allegations.\u201d",
      "In a letter to the judge on Thursday, Baldoni attorney Kevin Fritz accused Lively of a publicity campaign that left Baldoni and other defendants the \u201cobjects of public scorn and contempt.\u201d",
      "He said the actions had damaged those she sued so that they were \u201cexiled from polite society and suffered damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars due to Ms. Lively\u2019s scorched-earth media campaign.\u201d",
      "In the separate filing in Hays County, Texas, a precursor to another potential lawsuit, Lively asks for an order for a deposition from Jed Wallace, a crisis management specialist she alleges was behind much of the social media manipulation surrounding the film that turned public sentiment against her through posts on Reddit and TikTok.",
      "Wallace and his Texas-based firm Street Relations were brought on as subcontractors by publicists working with Baldoni and his production company, the filing said.",
      "\u201cHe weaponized a digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums,\u201d the filing alleges.",
      "Wallace is identified in Lively's federal lawsuit, but he is not a defendant.",
      "Freedman, who the filing says is Wallace's lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment on the issue.",
      "Lively sued Baldoni, his production company and others in New York in late December for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation and asked for unspecified damages. Baldoni sued earlier this month, accusing Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "The judge said Monday that he'll likely combine the lawsuits for trial.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.",

      "Swift walked down the tunnel to her usual suite about 90 minutes before kickoff. And while she was decked out in Chanel for the divisional round against Houston, she opted for a sleek black-and-gold Louis Vuitton look for the AFC title game, including a jacquard knit jacket that retails for $5,000 and a stocking cap with a list price of $830.",
      "Modest fare compared to what suite prices for the Super Bowl will probably run.",
      "Swift will almost certainly be in New Orleans with her celebrity friends when the Chiefs go for an unprecedented third straight Lombardi Trophy against the Philadelphia Eagles on Feb. 9. They got a big game from Patrick Mahomes \u2014 no surprise there \u2014 and some key stops from their defense to get past the Bills.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. And their relationship only seemed to blossom into the new year, with Swift eventually celebrating on the field with Kelce after the Chiefs had beaten the Ravens in Baltimore for the AFC championship.",
      "Then came the Super Bowl, and Swift's much-watched dash from a concert in Tokyo for kickoff of the big game in Las Vegas.",
      "She made it with plenty of time to spare, of course. And Swift became the focus of attention in her own right, winning what appeared to be a beer-chugging contest, partying with celebrity suite mates such as Blake Lively, Ice Spice and Lana Del Rey, and standing next to Kelce's mother, Donna, while he held aloft the Lombardi Trophy following the 25-22 win over the 49ers.",
      "The couple eventually locked lips again on the field at Allegiant Stadium.",
      "As confetti flew on the field, they kissed again in celebration at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday night. Swift gave Chiefs coach Andy Reid a big hug, and she celebrated with Donna Kelce and the rest of some 80,000 fans.",

      "Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall 2025 men\u2019s collection, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration",
      "PARIS -- Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall men\u2019s collection Saturday, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration. Jockeys\u2019 vibrant racing silks became her muse, a dynamic counterpoint to the French maison\u2019s storied equestrian roots. \u201cI wanted this collection to be strong and energetic,\u201d Nichanian explained, her palette pivoting from deep browns and dark teals to flashes of tomato red and lemon yellow.",
      "The collection radiated warmth, both in spirit and texture. Fuzzy mohair coats, velvet varsity jackets and plush sheepskin outerwear wrapped models in an embrace that seemed designed to counter winter\u2019s chill. Layering was less pronounced this season, a deliberate move to retain sleek, streamlined silhouettes. Even gray pinstripe suits \u2014 pared back to essentials \u2014 eschewed bulk, echoing Nichanian\u2019s vision of men unencumbered as they race through life.",
      "Sweaters emerged as the collection\u2019s unsung heroes. Their bold chevrons and geometric patterns were lifted directly from the vibrant stripes of racing silks, a playful nod to Palais d\u2019I\u00e9na\u2019s soaring, angular architecture. A standout turtleneck, with its patchwork of triangles, rectangles, and squares in canary yellow, seemed to channel a nostalgic love for trigonometry. Elsewhere, a jacket with a shawl collar mirrored the same graphical bravado, rendered in cool tones of blue, black and white.",
      "Though grounded in classic tailoring, the collection celebrated irreverence. Nichanian\u2019s juxtaposition of tradition and innovation captured Herm\u00e8s\u2019 ethos with a quiet confidence. Here, functionality was imbued with a touch of whimsy, proving once again that the maison\u2019s refinement can still surprise and delight. In a season steeped in nostalgia and geometry, Herm\u00e8s delivered a collection that was, quite literally, off to the races."

Those who did make it into the Library theater were treated to an intense, visceral, inventive story from filmmaker Mary Bronstein that has quickly become one of the festival\u2019s must-sees.",
      "Byrne plays Linda, who is barely hanging on while managing her daughter\u2019s mysterious illness. She\u2019s faced with crisis after crisis, big and small \u2014 from the massive, gaping hole in their apartment ceiling that forces them to move to a dingy motel, to an escalating showdown with a parking attendant at a care center. The cracks in her psychological, emotional and physical wellbeing are become too much to bear.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never seen a movie before where a mother is going through a crisis with a child but our energy is not with the child\u2019s struggle, it\u2019s with the mother\u2019s,\u201d Bronstein said at the premiere. \u201cIf you\u2019re a caretaker, you shouldn\u2019t be bothering with yourself at all. It should all be about the person you\u2019re taking care of, right? And that is a particular kind of emotional burnout state that I was really interested in exploring.\u201d",
      "Byrne and Bronstein went deep in the preparation phase, having long discussions about Linda with the goal of making her as real as possible before the quick, 27-day shoot. Byrne said she was obsessed with figuring out who Linda was before the crisis. The film was in part inspired by Bronstein\u2019s experience with her own daughter, but she didn\u2019t want to elaborate on the specifics.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s her story to tell,\u201d Bronstein said.",
      "Part of Linda\u2019s story involves her therapist, played by Conan O\u2019Brien, who joked that he didn\u2019t realize he was in a movie.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not looking out for movie scripts or anything. But when I got a call from A24 that they wanted me to read something, I\u2019m not stupid,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI showed it to my wife, who is one of the smartest people I know, and she read through it and she said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know they made movies like this anymore.\u2019\u201d",
      "He was particularly in awe of his director and co-star, saying he felt like a fraud standing beside them.",
      "\u201cIt was an amazing experience, one of the best experiences of my life, just to be with them and watch them work,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how (Byrne) did that and not check into a hospital afterwards, because I haven\u2019t seen any actor, man or woman, sustain that level for an entire movie.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like I have to go to a hospital now, because this was the first time I watched it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m a mess.\u201d",
      "A$AP Rocky also co-stars, as a man Linda meets at the motel, but was not in Park City for the premiere. He is currently on trial, charged with firing a gun at a former friend.",
      "The film is full of ambiguity, metaphor and just plain artistic expression that Bronstein hesitated to explain, from the name itself to the hole in the ceiling, which takes on a somewhat supernatural quality.",
      "\u201cWhen we have nothing left to give, we have an emptiness inside of us,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cAnd that emptiness is actually not empty: It\u2019s filled with all the darkness and self-hate and doubt and fear and dread and regret and everything. \u2026 That to me is what the hole is.\u201d",
      "Some of it, she said, she doesn\u2019t even fully understand. The point is the experience, and critics and Sundance audiences are already fully on board.",
      "Bronstein, a bit of a cult figure in the film world, made her directorial debut in 2008 at the SXSW festival with \u201cYeast,\u201d which featured a pre-fame Greta Gerwig and was hailed by by New Yorker critic Richard Brody as a \u201cmumblecore classic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You\u201d is only her second feature.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time that anybody else has paid for me to make art,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that this is the film that came directly from my head to the screen.\u201d",

      "The event had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as fans clapped, laughed and shouted \u201cYes queen!\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- To celebrate an upcoming milestone, Alyssa Math could think of nothing more fitting than front-row tickets to \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d author Rebecca Yarros' appearance at The Town Hall in Manhattan.",
      "\u201cI'm getting married next weekend, so this is my bachelorette party,\u201d said Math, an accountant who traveled with friends from her home near Annapolis, Maryland. She has been one of millions of admirers of Yarros' work and a year ago drove two hours to Reston, Virginia, to see the author.",
      "\u201cIt's a huge cult following,\u201d said Math, wearing a white veil in homage to one of Yarros' characters. \u201cThe drama (of her books) keeps you on the edge of your seat.\u201d",
      "Friday night at The Town Hall had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as a capacity crowd of around 1,500 clapped, laughed and shouted, \u201cYes, Queen!\" The \u201cEmpyrean\u201d series has made Yarros one of the country's most popular and obsessed-about leaders of romantasy, a newly branded genre combinging romance and fantasy.",
      "\u201cOnyx Storm\u201d is the much-awaited third installment of a planned five centered on the lovers Violet and Xaden, and the first since the million-selling \u201cIron Flame\u201d came out in 2023. In its first week of publication, \"Onyx Storm\" has already topped the bestseller lists of Amazon and sold more than 300,000 copies just through Barnes & Noble, according to a spokesperson for the superstore chain.",
      "Yarros, interviewed for some 75 minutes by Olympic gymnast and avowed fan Laurie Hernandez, shared a few insights about her writings (she already knows how the series will end), spoke lovingly of her husband (\"He's 6'4\" and hot as hell with a baby strapped to his chest\"), swore casually and joked that hers was the \u201conly profession where you can have imaginary fiends\u201d and not be considered insane.",
      "She expressed relief and pleasure over completing \u201cOnyx Storm,\" noting she had to block out her own popularity to get the writing done.",
      "\u201cAs much as I love you guys, I kind of pretend you don\u2019t exist,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of ignore you, but I love you at the same time.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnyx Storm\u201d isn't quite a Harry Potter-level phenomenon \u2014 the final Potter book by J.K. Rowling, \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d sold more than 8 million copies in the U.S. in its first 24 hours \u2014 but it carries a similar feeling of obsession, identification and spontaneity.",
      "Like the Potter books, the release of \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d was welcomed with midnight store parties around the country, gatherings for which fans showed up in costume. Some fans at The Town Hall finished the 526-page \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d within hours of receiving it, others are in no hurry.",
      "\"This is a book I personally want to take my time with,\" said Scarlett Fuentes, who arrived with her friend Zy Bao-angan, both of them in black leather.",
      "\"I want to savor this moment,\" Bao-angan said.",
      "Like Potter, enthusiasm for the Yarros books extends well beyond any organized publicity campaigns. The Potter books helped inspire some of the first Internet fan sites for books. Yarros and such fellow romantasy authors as Sarah J. Maas have been favorites of the young readers on BookTok, a TikTok community that has emerged as publishing's most effective driver of sales. Countless fans on BookTok and other social media \u2014 some crying, some cursing in amazement \u2014 have been posting their responses to \u201cOnyx Storm.\"",
      "On Friday, Hernandez and the audience posed questions about her books as if gossiping about friends. If Violet and Xaden were at a bar, what would they order? Violet would go for a lavender lemon drop, Xaden is fine with a beer. And which music genres define them? Xenon is heavy metal, Violet harder to label.",
      "Asked what was the most important lessons she has learned from writing the books, Yarros reminded her fans that she wasn't only a writer or public figure.",
      "\u201cI can say plotting and I can say everything, but probably the most important thing I've learned is that real life is what happens in my house, and what happens around my kitchenette and what happens in my living room chairs and what happens when my kids are all together and my husband's together,\u201d she said. \u201cReal life is not what happens on the internet.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love you guys,\u201d she added. \u201cBut peace out.\u201d"

A few hours later, at the Eccles, Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson, who won an Oscar for \u201cSummer of Soul\u201d in 2022, unveiled his Sly Stone portrait, \u201cSLY LIVES! (aka The Burden of Black Genuis).\u201d Earlier, \u201cOne Day in September\u201d filmmaker Kevin MacDonald also showcased his film \u201cOne to One: John & Yoko,\u201d which debuted last year at the Venice Film Festival and will get an IMAX release on April 11 before hitting Max later this year.",
      "Some critics reflected that \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a joint production between The Associated Press and PBS Frontline, was even more powerful than \u201c20 Days in Mariupol.\u201d \u201cSLY LIVES!\u201d (on Hulu Feb. 13) was called \u201csublime\u201d and \u201cilluminating\u201d in its examination of an underappreciated, shapeshifting genius.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been coming here since 2000 and I thought the coolest thing you could do would be to DJ an after party,\u201d Thompson said before the screening. \u201cI never dreamt this for my future, so this is really humbling.\u201d",
      "It was a full-circle end to a day that began with a slate of documentary Oscar nominations all connected to the Sundance Institute in some way. Some were supported by the Institute, some debuted at the festival as recently as last year.",
      "\u201cBlack Box Diaries,\u201d in which a Japanese filmmaker investigates her own sexual assault, had its premiere in Park City last year and was supported by the Institute\u2019s doc film program. \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective, was also supported by the film fund. \u201cPorcelain War,\u201d about Ukrainian artists in wartime, debuted at the festival in 2024, where it won the grand jury prize. \u201cSoundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat,\u201d about the assassination of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba in 1961, also launched last year and won a special jury prize. And, finally, \u201cSugarcane,\u201d a 2024 festival premiere investing abuse and missing children at an Indian residential school, was supported by a Sundance grant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really special,\u201d said Basil Tsiokos, a Sundance senior programmer. \u201cIt does speak to what Sundance brings to the artistic community and to the support that we show to artists out there.\u201d",
      "On Friday night, \u201cSugarcane\u201d filmmakers Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie are also being given an award at the Institute\u2019s fundraising gala. Newly anointed Oscar nominees James Mangold and Cynthia Erivo are also being honored.",
      "It\u2019s not lost on those who program for the festival and run the artists programs how crucial that initial support can be for someone trying to make a documentary.",
      "\u201cThe funding landscape is challenging, particularly in the nonfiction space,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cGetting early support from the artists programs, from the documentary feature programs is sort of a stamp of approval, of encouragement that helps other funders come in later on to take a seed of an idea and bring it into fruition.\u201d",
      "The Oscars and Sundance have long been connected, especially in the documentary space. For the past 25 years, there has been at least one Sundance movie every year that goes on to get an Oscar nomination. Some that have won the statuette include \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d \u201cMan on Wire,\u201d \u201cSearching for Sugar Man,\u201d \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d \u201cIcarus,\u201d \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d and \u201cNavalny.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe just provide a space for the films,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cThe films are from the artists. They\u2019re the ones with the vision to make these films possible. We provide them a platform to be able to meet their audiences. That\u2019s quite an important role that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "This year, the festival has about 40 feature documentaries premiering across sections on everything from Marlee Matlin and Selena Quintanilla, to one about Nairobi women transforming a formerly whites-only library into a cultural hub, to another on Florida\u2019s stand-your-ground laws. While it\u2019s difficult to project what might be in the Oscar race next year, Tsiokos has observed one trend that might help audiences pick and choose.",
      "\u201cThe influence of the international voters is growing. In the last couple of years especially, most of the nominees for the Oscar race tend to be international titles,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cI would tell people to make sure to check out the World Cinema Documentary Competition. There are some real gems.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Prosecutors say they won\u2019t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Prosecutors said Friday that they will not file charges against Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the allegations are too old under the law and the evidence is not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner.",
      "\u201cWe have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cWe recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.\u201d",
      "Nearly four years after the investigation began, then-District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said on Oct. 9 that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the \u201calready extensive\u201d file that authorities had amassed.",
      "LA County sheriff\u2019s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The probe included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office requested more evidence-gathering and the investigation resumed.",
      "\u201cWe are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start \u2014 Brian Warner is innocent,\u201d his attorney, Howard King, said in a statement.",
      "The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esm\u00e9 Bianco \u2014 who sued Manson in a case that has been settled \u2014 said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after.",
      "\u201cAlmost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,\u201d she said on Oct. 10. \u201cI described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner \u2014 better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson \u2014 had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.\u201d",
      "Bianco said she gave investigators \u201chundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status.\u201d",
      "In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies.",
      "\u201cWhilst I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the District Attorney to not bring charges in the case against Brian Warner, I am sadly not surprised,\u201d Bianco said in a statement released by her lawyer. \u201cOnce again, our justice system has failed survivors. Not the individual prosecutors and detectives who worked for years on this case, but the system that made them do so with one hand tied behind their collective backs.\u201d",
      "In 2021 Manson's former fianc\u00e9e, \u201cWestworld\u201d actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post.",
      "Wood and Manson\u2019s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.",
      "\u201cHe started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,\u201d Wood said.",
      "Manson replied on Instagram that these were \u201chorrible distortions of reality.\u201d He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood's attorney fees.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they\u2019ve been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done.",
      "Other women sued Manson in the months after Wood came forward. Wood's representative did not immedately return a message Friday.",
      "Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like \u201cThe Beautiful People\u201d and hit album\u2019s like 1996\u2019s \u201cAntichrist Superstar\u201d and 1998\u2019s \u201cMechanical Animals.\u201d"

      "PARIS -- Beige hunting jackets with oversized pockets, paired with discreet shirts and ties, opened Junya Watanabe\u2019s latest menswear show at Paris Fashion Week Friday.",
      "It was a deceptively classic start for the avant-garde Japanese designer, whose signature knack for subversive tailoring and patchwork soon disrupted conventions.",
      "What looked like classic Americana \u2014 thick denim jeans, caps, and check shirts \u2014 quickly morphed into something far less predictable. Exaggerated blown-up check pants in red with dramatic turn-ups injected a sense of whimsy, as did splashes of vivid color. A pale yellow jacket and a tactile padded coat in soft pastels softened the masculinity, reworking the rugged aesthetic into something gender-fluid.",
      "Flashes of bold hues, from vibrant red to bright blue checks, became a defining motif. The palette danced across reimagined hunting jackets and distinctly masculine silhouettes, which were disrupted by the designer\u2019s famed use of patchwork. Here, it wasn\u2019t just a technique but a conceptual statement \u2014 ideas and styles stitched together, creating contradictions.",
      "Hunting jackets might evoke tradition, but here they felt fresh, even irreverent, with their clever layering of fabrics and unexpected details. The collection demonstrated Watanabe\u2019s mastery in blending the familiar with the avant-garde, offering a \u201cbro\u201d aesthetic turned on its head by bursts of feminine color.",
      "The recurring themes of denim and disruptive tailoring felt polished yet safe, lacking the urgency or political edge that defined his earlier work."

    "story": [
      "Opening statements are beginning at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of firing a handgun at a former friend",
      "A$AP Rocky is the celebrity in the room, but A$AP Relli will star at his trial.",
      "The hip-hop star, fashion maven and actor, whose legal name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers, is accused of firing a gun at his former friend Relli, born Terell Ephron, on whose testimony prosecutors are pinning their case.",
      "Opening statements are set to begin Friday at the trial after a jury of seven women and five men was selected over the course of three days. Rocky is charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm.",
      "He took a major risk by turning down a prosecution plea deal offer of just six months in jail and instead choosing to go to trial. If convicted, he could be sentenced to a term of up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The defense plans to paint Ephron as a money seeker and point out he has sued Rocky in civil court, seeking financial damages for the incident.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the witness that this case will rise and fall on, for sure,\u201d Rocky\u2019s lead attorney Joe Tacopina said after a recent pretrial hearing. \u201cWhether he\u2019s a star is something that remains to be seen.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s jealousy obviously, and he\u2019s made that clear. He became a hater,\u201d Tacopina said. \u201cThis is in large part about money, money, money.\u201d",
      "Rocky and Relli were part of a group of young creators in high school in New York who called themselves A$AP \u2014 for Always Strive and Prosper \u2014 and initially remained close as Rocky found wealth and fame through music. The relationship soured, coming to a head with the alleged shooting on Nov. 6, 2021, when Ephron says Rocky fired on him and grazed his knuckles.",
      "The defense plans to call witnesses to testify that a firearm seen on a security video is a starter pistol that Rocky carried as a prop for security.",
      "They likely will say that is why, despite a search of the spot by many police officers, no shell casings were found at the site near Hollywood and Vine. Police did not recover a gun in the case.",
      "Ephron went to the police two days later and brought 9 mm shell casings he had picked up himself, which are both points the defense will seize on. No fingerprints were recovered from the casings.",
      "The trial\u2019s celebrity goes beyond Rocky. The Grammy-nominated hip-hop star\u2019s longtime partner is Rihanna and the couple have two toddler sons together.",
      "Tacopina suggested it\u2019s unlikely Rihanna will show up in court and her name may not come up at all, though it did frequently during jury selection when many prospective jurors said they were fans.",
      "Rocky has been named one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May and has a major role in a Spike Lee-directed film with Denzel Washington to be released soon after. But his life could be upended with a conviction.",
      "In the deal from prosecutors he rejected, Rocky was to plead guilty to one of the two counts in exchange for a sentence recommendation of 180 days in jail, a seven-year suspended prison sentence and three years of probation.",
      "Beyond Ephron, the prosecution's witnesses primarily will be the police who worked on the case.",
      "They also will rely heavily on surveillance video that captured parts of the incident and the circumstances. Prosecutors at the 2023 preliminary hearing showed a still image taken from video with a man in a hooded sweatshirt whose face is not visible holding what appears to be a gun, along with another image showing the face of the man in the sweatshirt, with no gun visible. A detective testified that investigators established it was Rocky.",
      "Rocky himself could take the stand and his attorney has said he wants to, but the lawyers say they have not yet decided and he is legally allowed to avoid testifying."

      "Marlee Matlin gives an unflinchingly honest account of her experiences as a deaf actor in the funny and revelatory documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Marlee Matlin gives an unflinchingly honest account of her experiences as a deaf actor in the funny and revelatory documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d The film kicked off the 41st Sundance Film Festival Thursday, as the first major premiere in the Eccles Theater in Park City, Utah.",
      "After the screening audiences in the theater, some wiping tears away, greeted Matlin with a standing ovation when she took the stage.",
      "The film delves into all aspects of her life, personal and professional: Her childhood and how her family handled learning she had become deaf at 18 months; her experience winning the best actress Oscar for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d and her allegedly abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "The film was directed by Shoshanna Stern, who also is deaf. Matlin specifically requested that Stern take on the project when American Masters approached her about doing a documentary.",
      "Matlin has written about her experiences before, including her volatile relationship with Hurt and drugs, in a memoir, \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later.\u201d But before the #MeToo movement, she felt her allegations were largely dismissed or glossed over.",
      "Interviews from the book's press tour show journalists were more interested in the \u201camazing sex\u201d she said she had with Hurt than the stories of the alleged physical and verbal abuse. One interviewer asked her why she waited \u201cso long\u201d to come forward with the claims.",
      "The documentary isn\u2019t just a portrait of Matlin, but a broader look at deaf culture and how Matlin was thrust into the spotlight at a young age as a de facto spokesperson for all deaf causes.",
      "In addition to being the first, and until Troy Kotsur won for \u201cCODA\u201d in 2022, only deaf actor to win an Academy Award, she helped lobby Congress for closed captioning and delved into the Gallaudet University protest about hiring hearing people to preside over the university, which is the subject of another Sundance documentary, \u201cDeaf President Now!\u201d",
      "Matlin also faced backlash when she spoke while presenting the best actor Oscar the year after she won, an experience that she said made her distance herself from deaf causes.",
      "It features moving interviews from her longtime translator and other important figures in her life such as Henry Winkler, who met her when she was a student at age 12.",
      "Winkler watched her perform a song during a school production after she wrote him a fan letter. Later, she stayed in his home for two years after her breakup with Hurt and had her wedding there. In the film, Matlin said she never would have pursued acting if it weren\u2019t for Winkler, although he disagreed.",
      "The film is closed captioned and includes verbal translations for hearing audiences. In a unique approach, the subjects were interviewed by Stern with an earpiece, allowing them to hear translations from another room.",
      "Matlin said she has struggled occasionally to convince the industry to let her play roles that aren\u2019t necessarily written for a deaf actor. Aaron Sorkin, who wrote a part for her in \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d dispelled the notion it is difficult to write for deaf actors.",
      "When \u201cCODA\u201d came around, the studio wanted to cast an A-list, hearing male star opposite Matlin. She threatened to walk if it weren\u2019t a deaf actor and was gratified when Kotsur won the Oscar, hence the \u201cnot alone anymore\u201d subtitle. Her big disappointment was not being able to say a few words on stage during the event.",
      "Asked why this moment was the right time for a documentary, Matlin said, \u201cIt\u2019s never really the right time. So, why not?\u201d",

      "Reality TV couple Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt are suing the city of Los Angeles after losing their home in the destructive fires that have swept Southern California in the past weeks",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Reality TV couple Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt are suing the city of Los Angeles after losing their Pacific Palisades home in the wildfires that have torn through Southern California in recent weeks.",
      "The couple, who rose to stardom on \u201cThe Hills,\" a spin-off of \u201cLaguna Beach,\u201d filed the lawsuit Tuesday along with more than 20 other property owners and residents who were affected by the Palisades Fire. The complaint blames Los Angeles and its municipal water department for the water issues that hampered firefighting efforts and says it ultimately led to the damage to their properties.",
      "The Eaton and Palisades fires, ignited by strong winds during one of the region's driest years on record, have killed 28 people and destroyed more than 12,000 structures, putting them among the most destructive fires in California history.",
      "There has been intense scrutiny over hydrants running dry and problems with water pressure, leading to a barrage of lawsuits against the city and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for an independent investigation into the LA water utility over the issues.",
      "The complaint filed by the couple and others mentions that the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which services the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, was offline and had been out of commission since February 2024 while awaiting repairs. The hydrants in the neighborhood were connected to three tanks that held 1 million gallons (3.7 million liters) of water each and went dry within 12 hours, the complaint said, citing Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, the water utility's chief executive and chief engineer.",
      "Without water from the reservoir, firefighters had to primarily rely on the water tanks, which were not designed to fight such a large fire, the complaint said.",
      "The city and water utility did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "While the repairs to the reservoir were requested in January 2024, the water utility told the Los Angeles Times they would not be completed until April or May 2025.",
      "The lawsuit called the Palisades Fire an \u201cinescapable and unavoidable consequence\u201d of the water system operated by the city and water utility.",
      "\u201cThe system necessarily failed, and this failure was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs to suffer the losses alleged in this complaint,\u201d it said.",
      "The plaintiffs cite the principle known as \u201c inverse condemnation,\u201d which is the same mechanism that requires utilities to pay for wildfire damages caused by their equipment."

      "Opening statements at the Los Angeles trial of the 36-year-old hip-hop superstar and fashion maven will likely begin Friday after the 12 jurors were selected. Four alternates still need to be selected.",
      "Rocky turned down a prosecution plea offer of 180 days in jail to risk years in prison if the jurors find him guilty of two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. He has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer says he committed no crime.",
      "He opted instead to risk trial on two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, charges that with conviction bring a penalty of up to 24 years in prison.",
      "It took the two sides 2 1/2 days to pick the jurors from a pool of more than a hundred candidates who packed into a downtown LA courtroom. Those chosen include a woman who is a podcast editor and actor, and a man who has worked for more than 20 years at Trader Joe's.",
      "Many were excused for cause, others sent away by one of the two sides. Each had 10 jurors they could excuse without a reason. The defense used seven of their challenges, the prosecution just two.",
      "One man questioned Thursday works as a civilian with the Los Angeles Police Department and has extensive ties to law enforcement including a cousin who was on the case's witness list but is not expected to be called.",
      "After the judge declined to dismiss him for cause, Rocky's lawyer Joe Tacopina took him off the jury.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s a shocker, we\u2019re going to thank and excuse juror number 27.\u201d",

      "Many questions were about the fame of both Rocky and especially Rihanna, his longtime life partner and the mother of his two toddler children. She was not in court Thursday, and it's not certain whether she will show up during the trial.",
      "\u201cWhat if Rihanna comes here to court, is it going to be hard for you to look over there, and see the defendant\u2019s family, and deliver a guilty verdict?\u201d Deputy District Attorney John Lewin asked one woman.",

      "Rocky is accused of firing three or four shots at Terell Ephron, a friend from his teenage years, on the streets of Hollywood in 2021. Ephron said the shots grazed his knuckles.

      "The film academy had plenty of surprise nominations Thursday for the 97th Oscars",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- In one of the more wide-open Oscar fields in recent history, there were plenty of nominations surprises Thursday.",
      "Not too long ago, it seemed that people like Angelina Jolie and Nicole Kidman were destined for best actress nominations, while general audience disinterest in the young Donald Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d might have indicated its awards chances were dead on arrival.",
      "But the members of the film academy had something different in mind. Here are some of the biggest snubs and surprises from the 97th Oscar nominations.",
      "The young Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d has been one of the bigger awards season question marks, especially after it failed to resonate with moviegoers in theaters. And yet both Jeremy Strong, for his portrayal for Trump lawyer Roy Cohn, and Sebastian Stan (who was also in the conversation for \u201cA Different Man\u201d ), for playing the future two-time president, made it in. Only Strong got nominated by the Screen Actors Guild.",
      "This will forever be one of the more confounding awards season oversights. Marianne Jean-Baptiste delivered one of the all-time great performances in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths,\u201d as the perpetually aggrieved and sharp-tongued London woman Pansy. The general thinking is that it was either going to be Jean-Baptiste or Fernanda Torres, and Torres got in for the equally beloved \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "This is perhaps up for debate, but there was certainly a lot of goodwill behind Anderson\u2019s movie-star turn in Gia Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Last Showgirl,\u201d especially considering her SAG nomination. But like with Jennifer Lopez and \u201cHustlers\u201d a few years ago, it was not meant to be at the Oscars.",
      "James Mangold has directed several awards darlings, including \u201cFord v Ferrari\u201d and \u201cWalk the Line\u201d but had consistently missed out on a best director nomination, until this year with \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d It may have come at the expense of Edward Berger, who missed out on a nod for \u201cConclave\u201d or Denis Villeneuve for \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d",
      "Daniel Craig gave one of his best performances as an American expat in Mexico in the torrid May-December romance in \u201cQueer,\u201d but it hasn\u2019t been resonating with awards voters. The Oscar snub is the final piece in a puzzle that just never came together.",
      "If there ever were a shoo-in for a nomination and an Oscar, on paper at least, it would be for Angelina Jolie playing opera legend Maria Callas. Filmmaker Pablo Larra\u00edn had not missed yet in getting best actress nominations for his famous, tragic women biopics, including Natalie Portman for \u201cJackie\u201d and Kristen Stewart for \u201cSpencer.\u201d But somehow Jolie did not make the cut in the end.",
      "\u201cBabygirl\u201d is not a cliche awards movie by a long stretch, but Nicole Kidman\u2019s performance as Romy, the buttoned-up, married CEO who begins a dangerous affair with a young intern at her company was undeniable. But a best actress win at the Venice Film Festival has never guaranteed Oscar success.",
      "Despite the wide love for \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d Felicity Jones has been curiously absent from many nominations lists for her sharp portrayal of Erzs\u00e9bet T\u00f3th. The cast did not even get recognized by SAG. But it just goes to show that it\u2019s never too late to sneak in for the big one",
      "A few years after Danielle Deadwyler was famously snubbed for \u201cTill,\u201d she has another snub to add to her resume for Malcolm Washington\u2019s adaptation of \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d This latest campaign might not have had as much steam behind it as \u201cTill,\u201d but at the very least one would assume that it could have been a make good.",
      "Supporting actress was one of the more chaotic and unpredictable categories this year, with so many deserving performers in the mix. Monica Barbaro was one of those that was on the fringe of possibilities for her turn as Joan Baez, singing and all, for \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "One who was not so lucky was Selena Gomez for \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d perhaps because she was partially competing with her co-star, Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a who simply had more momentum (and gave a moving speech at the Golden Globes).",
      "The incarceration drama \u201cSing Sing\u201d did get several significant nominations including for Colman Domingo, adapted screenplay and original song. But Clarence \u201cDivine Eye\u201d Maclin, who delivered a revelatory performance based on his own experience, was not among them. He is, however, credited with helping to write the story.",
      "Margaret Qualley seems to have been unfairly left out of much of the awards conversation around \u201cThe Substance,\u201d a movie that only works with a great Sue. But the focus has been more on Demi Moore, overdue for such recognition, and Coralie Fargeat \u2014 the only woman to score a best director nomination.",
      "Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross delivered one of their most popular scores ever this year for \u201cChallengers\u201d and yet were left off in a batch of nominees that included \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot.\u201d It\u2019s not even that they\u2019re consistently overlooked by the academy \u2014 they\u2019ve already won twice, for \u201cSoul\u201d and \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d",
      "Everyone expected the Latvian cat movie \u201cFlow\u201d to get a best animated feature nomination, especially after it won the Golden Globe. But the big surprise is that it got a second for best international feature \u2014 a first for Latvia. This is not a first for an animated movie to get into the international category, though: \u201cWaltz with Bashir\u201d and \u201cFlee\u201d had the honor before \u201cFlow,\u201d but neither ended up winning.",
      "RaMell Ross\u2019 \u201cNickel Boys\u201d has had quite the rollercoaster awards season journey, even though it\u2019s widely considered one of the best films of the year. The film academy thought so too, including it among the 10 best picture nominees (alongside other relative surprises like \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d). Oddly, though, it missed out on cinematography despite its inventive first-person point of view."

Luca Guadagnino produced the film, written and directed by Hailey Gates. It also stars Callum Turner and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny.

      "Dozens of jurors will return to a Los Angeles courtroom for the possibility of serving on the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is charged with firing a gun at a former friend",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A judge said he expects a jury will be chosen at the trial of A$AP Rocky on Thursday, while lawyers for the hip-hop star are protesting the dearth of Black candidates for the panel.",
      "Nearly one hundred potential jurors will pack into the Los Angeles courtroom for a third long day of questioning at the trial, where Rocky is accused of two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for allegedly firing on a former friend in Hollywood in 2021.",
      "Opening statements will begin once 12 of them, and four alternates, are seated.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re going to have a jury tomorrow,\u201d Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold said at the end of court Wednesday, thanking the panelists for their patience. \u201cThis is not going to go on forever.\u201d",
      "Other than dismissals for cause, each side can have 10 jurors dismissed without giving a reason. The defense has used four of its challenges. Prosecutors used just one. They said they are happy with the jury as currently composed. But that may change.",
      "Meanwhile, lawyers for Rocky said they planned to appeal a judge's rejection of their request for a hearing on why less than 5% of the jury pool is Black, while the area they are drawn from is 9% African American. It's possible that none of the 16 jurors selected will be Black.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re troubled by that to say the least,\u201d defense lawyer Joe Tacopina said. \u201cWe\u2019re in downtown Los Angeles, not a small town in Montana.\u201d",
      "The Rev. Al Sharpton said on the social platform X that he has been following the proceedings and was critical of the racial makeup of the juror pool.",
      "\u201cIt is absolutely ridiculous that the jury will be not fair and representative, so as to deprive A$AP Rocky of a fair trial,\u201d the post said. \u201cI am monitoring this trial and challenging the Los Angeles District Attorney to ensure that fair and representative justice is afforded to A$AP Rocky.\u201d",
      "The judge declined to pause the trial for the appeal.",
      "Prosecutors questioned potential jurors Wednesday about their attitudes toward police and celebrity.",
      "Deputy District Attorney John Lewin asked how many of the 12 people in the jury box during the first round of questioning consider themselves fans of Rihanna, who is Rocky's longtime life partner and the mother of his two toddler sons. Four said they were.",
      "He asked them whether they'll worry about the effect that convicting Rocky \u2014 on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, which could lead to many years in prison \u2014 could have on Rihanna.",
      "\u201cYou put it in my head, and now I'm like, \u2018Oh, it would affect her,\u2019\u201d one woman in the jury box responded.",
      "Rocky, who is free on bail and has pleaded not guilty, sat at the defense table, watching the questioning.",
      "Rihanna was not in court with him, but Rocky's mother and sister sat in his section of the gallery.",
      "When told who they were, Arnold marveled at the youthful appearance of his mother, Renee Black.",
      "\u201cWhat were you, 7 when you had him?\u201d the judge asked. She said she was 26.",
      "\u201cYou are very beautiful,\u201d the judge told her. \u201cThat's on the record.\u201d",
      "Jury selection began Tuesday after the 36-year-old Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers, turned down a deal offering 180 days in jail, a seven-year suspended sentence and three years\u2019 probation if he would plead guilty to one of the two counts.",
      "Rocky is set to headline the Rolling Loud California music festival in March, he has been named one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May, and he has a major role in a Spike Lee-directed film with Denzel Washington to be released soon after.",
      "But his life could be upended if he's convicted of firing a gun at Terell Ephron, a childhood friend who testified that their relationship had soured and a feud came to a head on the night of Nov. 6, 2021. Ephron testified that bullets grazed his knuckles."

And it\u2019s pretty wonderful,\u201d said Good last week with tears welling in her eyes, emotions heightened as she thought of her relationship with Jonathan Majors, her time on \u201cHarlem\u201d and the Los Angeles wildfires.\u201cI\u2019m just thankful for the journey and I\u2019m thankful to be loved.\u201d",
      "Much of that love has been provided by embattled actor Jonathan Majors, and the fluctuating journey includes their scrutinized relationship, leading Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cDivorce in the Black\u201d film and starring in the third and final season of \u201cHarlem,\u201d premiering Thursday on Prime Video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that the people who have supported us and have watched the show have waited on us like \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019\u201d said Good, who plays Camille, a Columbia University professor of sex and love. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool to be a part of something so amazing that people love.\u201d",
      "\u201cHarlem\u201d has been a survivor, emerging from the coronavirus pandemic and the Hollywood actors and writers strikes. The Tracy Oliver dramedy follows four women in their 30s (Good, Grace Byers, Jerrie Johnson and Shoniqua Shandai) living in Manhattan\u2019s historic Black neighborhood as they navigate love, friendships and careers. While the series didn\u2019t reach the acclaim of Issa Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure,\u201d it earned a staunch fan base.",
      "\u201cIf you really think about shows about New York, it\u2019s almost like purposefully excluding Black people ... so when we reflect on shows like \u2018Friends\u2019 or even \u2018Sex and The City,\u2019 I probably can count on one hand how many Black people I\u2019ve seen in those shows. But in New York, it\u2019s unavoidable because Black people have created the culture here, specifically in Harlem,\u201d said Johnson, who plays Tye, a queer dating app designer for LBGTQ+ people of color.",
      "\u201cWe loved our \u2018Living Single,\u2019 and that\u2019s why we loved it because we love seeing these women meeting in this small little apartment to commune with each other ... that\u2019s why we have such a cult following because there was a hole in the market that Tracy brilliantly filled.\u201d",
      "Good, 43, said the relationship she shares with her cast, crew and streaming platform is one she hadn\u2019t experienced. \u201cThis definitely has been the best professional experience I\u2019ve had in my entire career in terms of emotionally, mentally, professionally, spiritually.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an emphatic declaration by the former child star whose first major film appearance came in Ice Cube\u2019s 1995 classic \u201cFriday,\u201d shined in \u201cEve\u2019s Bayou\u201d and became a household name to kids on Nickelodeon\u2019s \u201cCousin Skeeter\u201d series.",
      "Adored for beauty throughout her relatively drama-free career, many fans questioned her relationship with Majors, the rapidly rising star of \u201cCreed III\u201d and \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\u201d It began toward the end of 2023 following the 35-year-old\u2019s arrest for allegations of escalating incidents of physical and verbal abuse toward ex-girlfriend Grace Jabbari.",
      "But the \u201cThink Like a Man\u201d and \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d actor said her Christian faith and life lessons prepared her for the backlash.",
      "\u201cI think about being in my 20s and you see the Media Take Outs and it\u2019s a hundred nice things and there\u2019s like one or two bad things. And I would just internalize it and I would cry and it would hurt my feelings so much,\u201d said Good, who also cited criticism from fellow Christians about her attire and film choices, false skin-bleaching allegations, and the end of her near decade-long marriage with pastor and Hollywood executive DeVon Franklin as perseverance-builders. \u201cI had been praying for maybe like five or six years, \u2019Lord, please deliver me from what people think about me. \u2026 But I will say the part of it that is still hard for me is to see them drag people I love.\u201d",
      "Majors was convicted of one misdemeanor assault charge and a harassment violation. He avoided jail time but was ordered to complete a yearlong counseling program. He also settled a civil suit with Jabbari, but the ordeal nearly extinguished his career.",
      "Good, who was by Majors\u2019 side at court dates and became in engaged to him in November, is optimistic his career will regenerate. (Ironically, Good starred in 50 Cent\u2019s \u201c21 Questions\u201d hit music video in which he proposes scenarios to a potential girlfriend to see if she\u2019d stand by him, including incarceration.)",
      "\u201cThe idea that people are like, \u2019Well, she got paid,\u201d said Good, rolling her eyes at suggestions it\u2019s a publicity stunt \u2014 \u201cit could be hurtful, but I just don\u2019t care anymore. And that\u2019s a good feeling.\u201d",
      "Good, who aspires to star in an action film, has been open about her desire to have children and is focusing on her future with Majors, including launching a health and wellness brand together.",
      "Admirers and industry colleagues believe Good deserves much more recognition.",
      "\u201cPeople have tried to pigeonhole her in a certain area that now she\u2019s breaking free. I always tell her that this is her phoenix moment ... the ashes actually being a metaphor for people\u2019s expectations of her,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cAbout 75% of my favorite movies that shaped my upbringing have Meagan Good in them ... I\u2019ve learned so much about transitioning into womanhood and adulthood through the characters that she\u2019s played.\u201d",
      "Good, however, stresses her focus is not on recognition or major awards, but reaching the hearts of people. She circles back to gratitude for a career that has defied Hollywood odds.",
      "\u201cTo have any appreciation is a gift,\u201d said Good. \u201cI feel like my best is yet to come. And I feel like even now, I\u2019m kind of just getting started.\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 08:58:14 -0500",
    "summary": "Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan",
    "story": [
      "Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan, the chief of the World Health Organization said Sunday, part of a series of attacks coming as the African nation's civil war escalated in recent days.",
      "The attack on the Saudi Teaching Maternal Hospital, which local officials blamed on the rebel Rapid Support Forces, came as the group was experiencing apparent battlefield losses to the Sudanese military and allied forces under the command of army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan. That includes Burhan appearing near a burning oil refinery north of Khartoum on Saturday that his forces said they seized from the RSF.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign Ministry denounced the attack as \u201ca violation of international law.\u201d",
      "International mediation attempts and pressure tactics, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, and sanctions targeting Burhan, haven't halted the fighting.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted the death toll in the hospital attack in El Fasher on the social platform X.",
      "Officials and others in the capital of North Darfur province had cited a similar figure Saturday, but Tedros is the first international source to provide a casualty number. Reporting on Sudan is incredibly difficult given communication challenges, the indiscriminate violence faced by civilians and exaggerations by both the RSF and the Sudanese military. Sudan's Foreign Ministry accused the RSF of launching a drone attack targeting the hospital's emergency ward, describing the assault as a \u201cmassacre.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe appalling attack on Saudi Hospital in El Fasher, Sudan, led to 19 injuries and 70 deaths among patients and companions,\u201d Tedros wrote. \u201cAt the time of the attack, the hospital was packed with patients receiving care.\u201d",
      "Another health facility in Al Malha also was attacked Saturday, he added.",
      "\u201cWe continue to call for a cessation of all attacks on health care in Sudan, and to allow full access for the swift restoration of the facilities that have been damaged,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cAbove all, Sudan\u2019s people need peace. The best medicine is peace.\u201d",
      "Tedros didn't identify who launched the attack, though local officials had blamed the RSF for the assault. U.N. official Clementine Nkweta-Salami, who coordinates humanitarian efforts for the world body in Sudan, warned Thursday that the RSF earlier had given \u201ca 48-hour ultimatum to forces allied to the Sudanese Armed Forces to vacate the city and indicated a forthcoming offensive.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince May 2024, El Fasher has been under RSF siege,\u201d she said. \u201cCivilians in El Fasher have already endured months of suffering, violence and gross human rights abuses under the prolonged siege. Their lives now hang in the balance due to an increasingly precarious situation.\u201d",
      "The RSF didn't immediately acknowledge the attack in El Fasher, which is more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Khartoum. The city is now estimated to be home to more than 1 million people, many of whom have been displaced by the war.",
      "The U.N. said in December that the RSF siege had killed 782 civilians and wounded more than 1,140 others, warning that the figures likely were higher.",
      "The Saudi hospital, just north of El Fasher's airport, sits near the front lines of the war and has been repeatedly hit by shelling. Still, its doctors continue surgeries, sometimes by the light of cellphones while the hospital is hit.",
      "However, the RSF appeared in recent days to have lost control of the Khartoum refinery, the biggest in Sudan and crucial to both its economy and that of South Sudan. Burhan's forces also say they broke another RSF besiegement of the Signal Corps headquarters in northern Khartoum. The rebels claimed they were \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around that base.",
      "Sudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF joined forces to lead a military coup in October 2021.",
      "Al-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in the western Darfur region with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. say the RSF and allied Arab militias are again attacking ethnic African groups in this war.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in April 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country.",
      "Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "On Sunday, Burhan traveled to the military's General Command headquarters in Khartoum, a building he hadn't been to since the fighting broke out in 2023. The headquarters is near Khartoum International Airport, which has seen fierce fighting during the war.",
      "\u201cThe armed forces are in their best condition and we will move forward with the determination of our people to eliminate the rebellion in all of Sudan,\u201d Burhan said, according to the state-run SUNA news agency.",

      "Weeks after the worst of the deadly fires tore through Los Angeles suburbs, families are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned cars and homes could be a health issue for awhile, especially for children",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Kelli Ferrone wiped blinds and window sills inside her daughters\u2019 elementary school, just a half mile from the devastating Palisades Fire that scorched the coastal enclave in Los Angeles. The cotton swabs and wipes came up black.",
      "There is scattered ash and soot at her feet. Outside, it's on the ground next to a playground.",
      "Ferrone, who recorded videos and shared them with The Associated Press, wanted to see for herself this week if Canyon Charter Elementary School had been adequately cleaned before the school reopens. She wasn't impressed.",
      "Weeks after the most intense days of fire across the Los Angeles area, parents are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned homes and cars could be harmful to their children. It's a risk that is becoming more common as wildfires burn in cities.",
      "In the Pacific Palisades, Canyon Charter could reopen as soon as Monday. School officials say staff are working hard to make sure schools are clean and safe and they're confident in their decision. But some parents feel the school is rushing to open. They're urging officials to temporarily relocate, while others try to transfer their students elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThe (Los Angeles Unified School District) has never experienced a disaster like this in their history,\" said Ferrone, who has two daughters at the school, one with asthma. \"And I do think people are trying really hard, but our school needs a new temporary home with classrooms and teachers teaching in-person. That is the only thing that is going to make people feel comfortable.\u201d",
      "In a statement, LAUSD said staff \u201chas worked diligently to prepare schools for a return to in-person instruction.\u201d That includes inspecting ventilation systems, replacing filters and installing air purifiers in classrooms and offices, and cleaning inside and outdoors. An environmental consultant is inspecting campuses. Staff monitors air quality. The district has an Office of Environmental Health and Safety and is following its protocols.",
      "Some schools are within a \u201cdo not drink water\u201d advisory, including Canyon Charter. That means fountains are turned off and bottled water is provided, the district said.",
      "Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, said the school is taking all the right steps. Yet, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s no zero risk.\"",
      "The ash is a toxic soup of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and every other kind of personal belonging. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead, all of which children are more vulnerable to.",
      "\u201cChildren often have more hand-to-mouth behavior and their bodies are rapidly growing in these first few years, and so they can be more sensitive to this type of pollution,\" said Patel. \"There will be a risk for a while to come in terms of exposure.\u201d",
      "Some materials form reactive chemical compounds when they burn.",
      "Scientists still don't know the long-term health impacts of exposure to massive urban fire like this year's in California or the one in Maui, Hawaii in 2023. Three schools in Lahaina didn't reopen for two months after that. But some chemicals have been linked to heart disease and lung issues, while exposure to minerals like magnetite, which can form when fire burns iron, has been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "In Pasadena, Emily Stough is trying to minimize the risks for her 11- and 14-year-old who returned to Blair High School, which includes a middle school, this week. She made sure they took masks. In an email to parents last week, the Pasadena Unified School District said some 38 tons of outdoor debris have been hauled away from campuses, and they will only open \u201cafter rigorous cleaning and sanitizing and environmental tests.\"",
      "Stough said she trusts the district to do its due diligence, but she wants more information.",
      "\u201cDid they test air quality? Did they test ash samples? Were the ash samples from inside the school, in the hallways, from outside the schools?,\" she wonders. \"Air quality both inside and outside the schools? I\u2019d like to see that. I\u2019d like to know what cleaning was done.\u201d",
      "The PUSD did not respond to questions from the AP.",
      "It\u2019s hard to know how long these fire toxins will stay in the environment, said Patel, but it could be a few months. Strong winds like the Santa Anas could also blow them distances where they could enter soil and groundwater.",
      "Plastics in particular could last a long time, said Dr. Ilan Shapiro, medical affairs officer for AltaMed and a fellow with the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cAnd we need to remember that the fires are still going. That we still have burn materials coming out.\" As communities recover and clean up, that ash will be moved again, he said.",
      "Longfellow Elementary School in Pasadena is set to reopen next week, but Tanya Reyes doesn\u2019t plan to send her kids back just yet. The school is about two miles from where the Eaton Fire burned down the home they rented. Even with the school's safety measures, \u201cmy gut is saying \u2018no,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be around that area. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d",
      "Her family is staying in West Hollywood, and she\u2019s looking for schools there, somewhere the kids can attend for a little while. She's considering home schooling, too, but still figuring it all out.",
      "It's hard for parents because they understand all the ways kids need school.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this in so many different ways, whether it\u2019s been wildfire smoke or the pandemic,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWhen kids miss school, that is also a detriment to their health. It impacts their learning, it impacts their socioemotional development, their sense of connection and community during a time of crisis.\"",

      "President Trump\u2019s first week in office included a flurry of executive orders with implications for Earth\u2019s climate and environment",
      "President Trump's first week in office included a flurry of executive orders with implications for Earth's climate and environment.",
      "While former President Joe Biden made climate change a hallmark of his administration and some of his policies remain, at least for now, Trump is quickly unraveling that.",
      "Experts say Trump's moves to step away from global climate action, ramp up domestic oil and gas production and remove incentives for electric vehicles are worrisome as the planet continues to heat up. 2024 was Earth's hottest year on record, and climate scientists say the rising heat is contributing to extreme weather affecting millions.",
      "\u201cThese orders will make our air dirtier, make people sicker, make energy more expensive, and make our communities less prepared for extreme weather,\" wrote Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a marine biologist, policy expert and author who co-founded the non-profit think tank Urban Ocean Lab.",
      "Here are some of Trump's most notable moves affecting climate and environmental issues in his first week:",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing the United States to again withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement aimed at global cooperation on climate change.",
      "The agreement requires participating countries to come up with nationally determined contributions to the effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet. Trump's move means the federal government won't be trying to meet emissions reductions goals, nor any financial commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",
      "\u201cWalking away from the Paris Agreement won\u2019t protect Americans from climate impacts, but it will hand China and the European Union a competitive edge in the booming clean energy economy and lead to fewer opportunities for American workers,\u201d said Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Trump declared an energy emergency via executive order earlier this week amid a promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The order urges oil and gas expansion including through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allow the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.",
      "Experts dispute his description of an \u201cinadequate energy supply\u201d as part of the basis for the order.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that the United States is well-supplied with energy in all of its forms,\u201d said Gary Dirks, senior director of the Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University. Dirks said he thinks the move is actually more targeted at bringing down prices at the pump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the United States right now is the largest producer of oil of any nation in history. And we got to that point under the Biden administration, not because of the Biden administration\u2019s policies necessarily, but because of policies that have been ongoing for four decades,\u201d he said.",
      "One section of the order declaring an energy emergency states that the Endangered Species Act cannot be an obstacle to energy development.",
      "The Endangered Species Act has been a hurdle for the development of fossil fuels in the U.S. for decades, and weakening it would accelerate the decline and potential extinction of numerous endangered species, including whales and sea turtles, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "Trump also opened up areas in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. Biden had previously both restricted and approved drilling in other parts of the Arctic, part of a long process mired in litigation and complicated by political battles.",
      "\u201cI would begin by pointing out that there was an attempt to lease for oil drilling recently and nobody bid,\u201d Dirks said. \u201cI don\u2019t actually think that the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge is an exciting place for oil and gas exploration.\u201d",
      "But he expressed concern about preserving biodiversity, something other scientists and environmental groups have highlighted.",
      "\u201cThe Arctic is a very fragile system,\u201d said Peter Schlosser, vice president and vice provost of global futures at Arizona State. Schlosser added that drilling there would disrupt the land and sea, and that potential contamination or oil spills are more difficult to clean up there due to low temperatures.",
      "Trump promised to eliminate what he incorrectly calls Biden's \u201celectric vehicle mandate.\"",
      "What that means in practice is that the order will revoke a non-binding goal set by Biden to have EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. He will also likely seek repeal of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases approved by Congress as part of Biden\u2019s landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "All of that is likely frustrating for automakers, who have to make long-term decisions, said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at auto-buying research firm Edmunds. As the rest of the world moves to electric cars, automakers have to decide how to factor in the global direction the industry is headed alongside the sudden lack of federal support.",
      "\u201cWe do think that the long-term end goal here is going to be electrification. It\u2019s just the timeline it seems is uncertain right now,\u201d she said.",
      "When the government reviews new facilities that emit pollution, officials are no longer likely to consider a concept known as environmental justice, or how that new pollution will add to the emissions that have tended to fall more heavily on poor and minority communities.",
      "Those are sweeping moves that Rena Payan, chief program officer at nonprofit Justice Outside, called \u201crolling back decades of progress in addressing environmental discrimination.\u201d",
      "That means more of a burden for state and local groups to fight to protect those communities. Trump\u2019s decision to cut off support will hurt, but many of these organizations are used to operating without federal support \u2014 they have done so for years, according to Peggy Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m grappling right now with is both the grief of these losses, and the fact that we were on an upward swing, if you will, just weeks ago,\u201d said Jade Begay, an Indigenous rights and climate organizer.",

      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients about the shots.",
      "Many see a political opportunity to rewrite policies in their states after President Donald Trump's return to the White House and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 's nomination as the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency oversees virtually every aspect of vaccination efforts in the U.S., from funding their development to establishing recommendations for medical providers to distributing vaccines and covering them through federal programs.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates against dangerous infections like measles and polio continue to fall nationwide, and the number of parents claiming non-medical exemptions so their kids don't get required shots is rising.",

Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d concerned that those declining childhood vaccination rates will lead to more outbreaks, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet only about 4 in 10 Americans oppose reconsidering the government\u2019s recommendations for widely used vaccines, while roughly 3 in 10 are in favor. The rest \u2014 about 3 in 10 \u2014 are neutral.",
      "Scott Burris, director of Temple University\u2019s Center for Public Health Law Research, has tracked public health legislation for years, and watched backlash against COVID-19 vaccines grow to include more routine vaccines as anti-vaccine activists take hold of powerful political pulpits.",
      "\u201cI think COVID and the politics gave standard vaccine denialists a lot of wind in their sails,\" he said.",
      "It's hard to predict what will pass into law in the states, Burris said, considering the vast majority of proposed bills in any state go nowhere. But the proposed legislation offers a glimpse into lawmakers\u2019 thoughts, and what else might follow.",
      "Religious exemptions for school vaccine requirements are among the most popular proposals so far. Lawmakers in New York, Virginia, Connecticut and Mississippi have introduced bills that would allow more people to waive routine shots. Indiana lawmakers will weigh religious exemptions for medical students.",
      "Earlier this month, West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order on his first day in office that enabled families to receive religious exemptions from required school vaccinations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge step,\" said Brian Festa, co-founder of the law firm We The Patriots USA, which works on vaccination-related cases throughout the country. \"That\u2019s a state that never had a religious exemption.\u201d",
      "Now, only four states allow just a medical exemption from childcare and K-12 immunization requirements: Connecticut, California, New York and Maine.",
      "Festa credited West Virginia's new religious exemption to Trump's nomination of Kennedy, as well as a 2023 federal court ruling that required Mississippi to allow residents to cite religious beliefs when seeking exemptions from state-mandated vaccinations for children.",
      "\u201cI think the writing\u2019s on the wall and they did feel the pressure,\u201d Festa said of West Virginia.",
      "In Connecticut, at least four Republican bills will try to revive the state's religious exemption for schools, colleges and daycares \u2014 something a contentious 2021 state law eliminated for students without an existing exemption.",
      "Connecticut health experts said at the time there was a slow but steady increase in the number of religious exemptions and declining vaccination rates in some schools. The state has historically maintained some of the highest childhood vaccination rates in the county, and in the 2023-2024 school year, more than 97% of kindergarteners protected against chickenpox, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and more.",
      "Given that the U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to the Connecticut law and the statehouse is controlled by Democrats, GOP state Sen. Eric Berthel said he\u2019s not optimistic legislative leaders will allow debate on his exemption bill, but does believe the broader cultural shift means \u201cmaybe there is a bit of an appetite to look at things like this again.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that we\u2019re not being fair to families who have a true faith-based reason to not vaccinate their child,\u201d he said.",
      "There's one outlier so far among statehouse trends on exemptions. Hawaii, where legislators are looking to move in the opposite direction with a bill to eliminate all non-medical waivers after struggling for years with high exemption rates.",
      "Other vaccine-related bills touch on some of the opposition that's been growing since the pandemic.",
      "Oklahoma and Alabama have proposals that would require parental consent for any vaccine given to minors. Bills in Wyoming, Oregon and Oklahoma would prohibit \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against people who aren\u2019t vaccinated against COVID-19 or other diseases.",
      "New York and Oklahoma have bills that would require providers to give people getting shots a full ingredient list, and Florida legislation would ban edible vaccines, though none are approved for use in the U.S. and research is still in early stages.",
      "Vaccine injury is also a popular topic, and bills in Indiana and North Dakota propose creating state versions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \u2014 a federal database that drew the attention of vaccine skeptics during the pandemic. Anyone can file a report about a potential issue after a vaccine, though the CDC\u2019s website notes a report doesn\u2019t prove the shot caused a health issue.",
      "North Dakota Republican state Sen. Dick Anderson said he's not against people getting vaccines \u2014 he got one COVID-19 shot himself \u2014 but proposed the bill because many people don't trust the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe have to do something to restore trust in the system,\" Anderson said.",
      "But experts note state databases are unnecessarily duplicative.",
      "\u201cA lot of these proposals, they're trying to fix something that's not broken and really working to counter the goal of preventing the spread of communicable disease,\u201d said Andy Baker-White, senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "Policy should be focused on getting rid of barriers to vaccination, not adding to them, said Dr. Susan Kressly, a pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Many families miss vaccinations not because of ideology, she said, but because of lack of transportation or not having primary care doctors or clinics nearby, among other things.",
      "But because most Americans are vaccinated, they haven't seen the effects of dangerous infections like bacterial meningitis that Kressly fielded calls about from fearful parents early in her career.",
      "\"Vaccines are really an American success story,\" she said.",

      "A new study suggests that a pill used for emergency contraception could be repurposed at a higher dose as an abortion drug, providing a possible alternative to mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in the most common type of abortion in the United States.",
      "Mifepristone has been under attack by abortion opponents, with several states seeking in federal court to restrict its use.",
      "Now used in two-thirds of U.S. abortions, mifepristone blocks a hormone needed to sustain a pregnancy. It's typically used with misoprostol, which causes contractions and bleeding.",
      "In the study, 133 women who were up to nine weeks' pregnant took a 60 milligram dose of ulipristal acetate, the active ingredient in the prescription contraceptive Ella, followed by misoprostol 24 hours later.",
      "For 97% of them, that drug combo was effective at inducing an abortion, an effectiveness equal to the mifepristone-misoprostol combination. Four women needed a procedure or an additional medication to complete the abortion.",
      "The 60 milligram dose of ulipristal used in the study is twice the dose of Ella, a prescription drug used for emergency contraception.",
      "The company that makes Ella says on its website that it won't end an existing pregnancy. It can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy.",
      "The findings, published Thursday in the journal NEJM Evidence, may make emergency contraception a target of abortion opponents.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really worried that these results could be misapplied by anti-abortion activists to try to further their assault on contraception,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman of the University of California, San Francisco, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal.

    "summary": "Digital screens are pervasive at work and in homes and schools stores",
    "story": [
      "Digital screens are pervasive at work and in homes and schools stores",
      "NEW YORK -- The trouble started every day at around 3 p.m., after Cathy Higgins had spent five or six hours staring at an array of computer screens at her desk. Her university job overseeing research projects involved peering closely at numbers and details on contracts, applications and budgets.",
      "\u201cMy vision was so blurry, I couldn\u2019t even see what was on the screen, and I was squinting so much that I could not function,\u201d Higgins said.",
      "When her eyesight got bad, Higgins walked around and spoke with members of her staff. She began planning in-person meetings for afternoons. But she would resume the computer work late at night after her children went to bed.",
      "\u201cIf I had to continue working through the blurry vision, that\u2019s when the migraines would happen,\u201d Higgins said.",
      "Digital screens are pervasive, not only at work but in our homes, schools and shops. An estimated 104 million Americans of working age spend more than seven hours a day in front of screens, according to the American Optometric Association. All that screen time can take a toll.",
      "Too much exposure to screens can lead to dry or watery eyes, fuzzy vision and headaches. It can also lead to myopia, or nearsightedness, in some people, especially children. Some technology workers even describe short bouts of vertigo when they look at screens for too long.",
      "One reason for the discomfort is that staring closely at screens for prolonged periods causes the muscle that helps eye focus to tighten up.",
      "\u201cThat muscle's not supposed to stay tight all day long. And if it does, it's like picking up a light weight and trying to hold it over your head for hours,\u201d American Optometric Association President Steven Reed said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to pick it up. But after a while, even though it\u2019s not a heavy lift, your body just gets tired.\u201d",
      "Fortunately, exposure to blue light from computer screens and devices has not been shown to cause permanent eye damage, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology.",
      "Nevertheless, symptoms can disrupt work, family time and rest. As an optometrist in Mississippi, Reed sees patients who complain of frequent eye pain, headaches and blurry vision associated with computer use. He advises getting an eye exam and taking frequent breaks.",
      "For Higgins, trying to catch up on the work she couldn't do when her eyes were too fatigued on weekdays cut into time she spent with her daughters on weekends. \u201cThey\u2019d be playing together, and I couldn\u2019t be as engaged as I would have liked to have been in what they were doing,\u201d she said.",
      "Here are some tips from eye health professionals to reduce eye strain caused by devices.",
      "Take a break every 20 minutes from sitting at a computer. During the break, focus your eyes on something that's about 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Pausing close-up work and looking at something in the distance gives tired, tight muscles time to relax.",
      "\u201cLuckily, eye strain is temporary,\u201d said Raj Maturi, an ophthalmologist at Midwest Eye Institute in Indianapolis who serves as spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. \u201cThe best way to avoid these symptoms is by taking breaks from our screens or near work activities and using lubricating eye drops, if needed.\u201d",
      "People usually blink about 18 to 22 times per minute. But when looking at a screen, the rate drops to three to seven times per minute, according to the Cleveland Clinic. That's where eye drops come in.",
      "It's good to move around and go outside, but when you don't have time for an outdoor walk, frequent 20-second breaks can help.",
      "Some people find that using a larger computer monitor helps reduce eye fatigue. You can also increase the font size on your laptop, monitor or smartphone screen.",
      "Higgins did all of the above after she started a new job as senior vice president at Stand Up to Cancer. Since she works remotely from home in Midlothian, Virginia, she got a 29-inch monitor and sits about three feet away from it, about a foot farther than in most office setups.",
      "The changes helped. She still has occasional issues with blurriness, but not as frequently. \u201cWhen I have an extended day, like a 12-hour day, that\u2019s when I start to have vision issues again,\u201d she said.",
      "Sitting an arm\u2019s length away from your screen and adjusting it so you\u2019re looking slightly downward also can help reduce eye strain, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology.",
      "Some products, such as blue light glasses, are marketed with claims that they will reduce digital eye strain, improve sleep and prevent eye disease. But several studies have found the glasses are not very effective, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology. It's really our behavior with digital devices that causes symptoms, not the small amount of blue light coming from screens, the group said.",
      "After stepping away from computers at work, many people find themselves reading or scrolling on smartphone screens. It's not just workers: children are using laptops, tablets and smart screens in school settings throughout the day.",
      "Too much screen time or focusing on nearby objects can accelerate the onset and progression of nearsightedness, especially in children, said Ayesha Malik, pediatric optometrist in the division of ophthalmology at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Anyone streaming shows should do so on a television, instead of a tablet, to help relieve eye strain, she said.",
      "Children should follow the 20-20-20-2 rule, which includes an extra \u201c2\u201d at the end to encourage playing outdoors for 2 hours a day, which helps with eye development, she said.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that most children are engaging with screens throughout the day at school and home. It becomes difficult to track the total number of hours,\u201d Malik said. \u201cAim for not more than 20 minutes during any one session.\u201d",
      "The blue light that digital screens emit can increase alertness, so watching Netflix on an iPad or scrolling through social media feeds in bed may make it hard to get restful sleep.",
      "To give your eyes and brain the rest they need, doctors recommend turning off screens one to two hours before going to sleep. You can also set devices to \u201cdark mode\u201d in the evening to reduce the impact of bright light. If you\u2019re used to streaming videos at night, try listening to an audiobook or podcast instead.",

      "The overnight attack happened in Qila Abdullah, a district in Balochistan province, the military said in a statement. It said the attempt by insurgents to enter the post was foiled, and the attackers then rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a perimeter wall.",

      "The gas-rich Baluchistan province has also been the scene of a low-level insurgency by small separatist groups for more than two decades. They initially wanted a share of provincial resources, but later they launched an insurgency for independence. Pakistani Taliban also have a strong presence in the province."

    "story": [
      "Serbia\u2019s populist Prime Minister Milos Vucevic has resigned following weeks of massive anti-corruption protests over the deadly collapse of a concrete canopy in November",
      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia\u2019s populist Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned Tuesday in an attempt to calm political tensions and pressure roiled by weeks of massive anti-corruption protests over the deadly collapse of a concrete canopy.",
      "The canopy collapse in November, which killed 15 people in the northern city of Novi Sad, has become a flashpoint reflecting wider discontent with the increasingly autocratic rule of Serbia\u2019s populist President Aleksandar Vucic. He has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms in Serbia despite formally seeking European Union membership for the troubled Balkan nation.",
      "\u201cIt is my appeal for everyone to calm down the passions and return to dialogue,\u201d Vucevic told a news conference announcing his resignation.",
      "Novi Sad Mayor Milan Djuric also stepped down on Tuesday.",
      "Vucevic\u2019s resignation could lead to an early parliamentary election. The resignation must be confirmed by Serbia\u2019s parliament, which has 30 days to choose a new government or call a snap election.",
      "Pro-government media said President Vucic will attend a Cabinet session on Tuesday evening to decide whether a new prime minister-designate will be appointed or an early election called.",
      "Opposition parties have said they would insist on a transitional government that would create conditions for a free and fair election. Vucic's populists have faced accusations of irregularities during past elections.",
      "Vucevic became the prime minister in April 2024, after the Serbian Progressive Party won most votes in an election marred by tensions.",
      "\u201cThey (ruling party) have been in a free fall since the Novi Sad tragedy,\u201d journalist Slobodan Georgiev said on N1 television, adding that Vucic was seeking a \u201cbuffer\u201d with the prime minister's resignation.",
      "Vucic in the past had managed to cushion the impact of anti-government street protests, but the current student movement has garnered widespread support from all walks of life, including actors, farmers, lawyers and judges.",
      "The students' call for justice has resonated in a country where corruption is widespread and few feel that the state institutions work in the interests of citizens.",
      "Branimir Jovancicevic, professor at the Faculty of Chemistry in Belgrade, expressed hope that Vucevic's resignation is a first step toward further political changes in Serbia, where power is concentrated in the hands of the president although his constitutional role is largely ceremonial.",
      "\u201cIf the president thinks that by replacing one, essentially, unimportant figure ... will solve the problem ... he is deeply mistaken,\" said Jovancicevic. \u201dThis must lead to total political changes because autocracy and dictatorship in Serbia, in the heart of Europe, must be stopped.\u201d",
      "On Monday, tens of thousands of people joined striking university students in a 24-hour blockade of a key traffic intersection in the Serbian capital. Serbia's students are demanding accountability for the canopy collapse that critics have blamed on rampant government corruption.",
      "Classes at Serbia's universities and dozens of schools have been blocked for two months with students camping inside their faculty buildings.",
      "In another attempt to defuse tensions, Vucic, Vucevic and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic on Monday evening urged dialogue with the students, who have so far rebuffed such invitations. They say Vucic shouldn't be the one holding talks with them but that government institutions such as police and the judiciary should do their job.",
      "Vucevic said the immediate cause for his quitting was an attack on a female student in Novi Sad early Tuesday by assailants allegedly from the ruling Serbian Progressive Party. Vucevic said that \u201cwhenever it seems there is hope to return to social dialogue, to talk ... it\u2019s like an invisible hand creates a new incident and tensions mount again.\u201d",
      "But the outgoing prime minister also said that the street protests \u201cundoubtedly\u201d have been organized from abroad \u201cwith an aim to directly jeopardize Serbia as a state.\u201d Vucevic offered no evidence for his claims that echoed earlier similar statements by Vucic.",
      "\u201cI can never justify or understand many of these protests, blockades of lives, of roads and the freedom of movement of other citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Students in Novi Sad said they were horrified by the assault they said was carried out by thugs with baseball bats. They attacked two groups of students and chased them in their car, the students said. Prosecutors later said that four people have been detained.",
      "\u201cWe are horrified over the state of our society where such a situation is possible,\u201d the students said in an Instagram post. \u201cWe have had enough of blood.\u201d",
      "The students called a big rally in Novi Sad later Tuesday in response to the attack.",
      "Serbia\u2019s prosecutors have filed charges against 13 people, including a government minister and several state officials for the November canopy collapse. But the former Construction Minister Goran Vesic, who had resigned shortly after the canopy crash, has been released from detention, fueling doubts over the investigation\u2019s independence.",
      "The main railway station in Novi Sad was renovated and inaugurated twice in recent years as part of a wider infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies and a fast railway link with neighboring Hungary.",
      "Several incidents have marred the street demonstrations in the past weeks, including drivers ramming in to the crowds on two occasions, when two young women were injured.",
      "Students and others have been holding daily 15-minute traffic blockades throughout Serbia at 11:52 a.m., the exact same time the concrete canopy crashed down on Nov. 1. The blockades honor the 15 victims, including two children. The blockades were also held on Tuesday."

      "Dozens of demonstrators have attacked several foreign embassies, including those of Rwanda, France and Belgium, demanding that they oppose the advance of Rwanda-backed M23 rebels into a major city in the country\u2019s conflict-battered east",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Dozens of demonstrators attacked several foreign embassies, including those of Rwanda, France and Belgium, on Tuesday demanding that they oppose the advance of Rwanda-backed M23 rebels into a major city in the country\u2019s conflict-battered east.",
      "Police fired teargas at the protesters as they marched to the embassies in Kinshasa, looting and setting fires to parts of the buildings. The embassies of Kenya and Uganda were also attacked, according to Associated Press journalists at the scene.",
      "Congo\u2019s security forces were attempting to slow the rebels, who advanced into Goma, a key eastern city, in a major escalation of the decadeslong conflict.",
      "The M23 rebels are one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region in the conflict, one of Africa\u2019s largest.",
      "The protesters demanded that the international community pressure Rwanda over the rebel advance.",
      "\u201cWe denounce the hypocrisy of the international community,\" said Timoth\u00e9e Tshishimbi, one of the protesters. \"They must tell Rwanda to stop this adventure.\u201d",
      "Residents reported gunfire overnight in Goma, a city of 2 million people which the rebels claimed to have captured on Monday. Explosions and gunfire were heard near the now-shut Goma airport.",
      "Goma is a regional trade and humanitarian hub holding hundreds of thousands of the more than 6 million people displaced by eastern Congo's prolonged conflict over ethnic tensions that have resulted in one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "The M23 rebels temporarily took over Goma in 2012 before being forced to pull out under international pressure, and resurfaced in late 2021 with increasing support from Rwanda, according to Congo\u2019s government and United Nations experts. Rwanda has denied such support.",
      "It was unclear how much of Goma is controlled by the rebels, who marched into the city early Monday to both fear and cheers among residents. It was the culmination of weeks of fighting during which the rebels captured several towns in a shocking advance.",
      "\u201cSince morning we have heard bomb explosions and crackling bullets,\u201d said Sam Luwawa, a resident of Goma. \u201cSo far we cannot say who really controls the city.\u201d",
      "Three South African peacekeepers were killed on Monday when the rebels launched a mortar bomb toward the Goma airport which landed on the nearby South African National Defense Force, while a fourth soldier succumbed to injuries sustained in fighting days ago, the South African Department of Defense said Tuesday.",
      "That makes 17 peacekeepers and foreign soldiers who have been killed in the fighting, according to U.N. and army officials.",
      "The humanitarian situation in Goma \u201cis extremely, extremely worrying, with a new threshold of violence and suffering reached today,\u201d Bruno Lemarquis, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Congo, told reporters in a video news conference on Monday. He said hundreds of thousands of people were attempting to flee the violence.",
      "There were active combat zones in all areas of the city, with civilians taking cover and heavy artillery fire directed at the city center on Monday, Lemarquis said. He said several shells struck the Charit\u00e9 Maternelle Hospital in central Goma, \u201ckilling and injuring civilians, including newborns and pregnant women.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat is unfolding in Goma is coming on top of what is already one of the most protracted, complex, serious humanitarian crises on Earth, with close to 6.5 million displaced people in the country, including close to 3 million displaced people in North Kivu,\u201d Lemarquis said.",
      "Aid groups are reporting they are unable to reach displaced people who rely on them for food and other necessities.",
      "\u201cKey roads surrounding Goma are blocked, and the city\u2019s airport can no longer be used for evacuation and humanitarian efforts. Power and water have reportedly been cut to many areas of the city,\u201d said David Munkley, head of operations in eastern Congo for the Christian aid group World Vision.",
      "In addition to the U.N., several countries including the United States, United Kingdom and France have condemned Rwanda for the rebel advance. The country, however, blames Congo for the escalation, saying it failed to honor past peace agreements, necessitating Rwanda's \"sustained defensive posture.\u201d",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the advance by the Rwanda-backed rebels in a call with Congo President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi on Monday during which both leaders agreed on the importance of advancing efforts to restart peace talks between Congo and Rwanda \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement.",
      "The Congolese leader will address the nation on the conflict, authorities said, amid growing pressure to act on the escalation.",
      "Opposition leader Martin Fayulu appeared to suggest the president was not doing enough to respond to the crisis. In a statement, Fayulu called for protests against Rwanda and for support for Congo from the international community, adding: \u201cIf Mr. F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi persists in standing in the way, he will be held solely responsible for the decline of our nation and will have to resign.\u201d",

      "Pakistan\u2019s upper house of parliament has passed a controversial bill that critics say threatens freedom of speech",
      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan\u2019s upper house of parliament on Tuesday passed a controversial bill that critics argue is designed to suppress freedom of speech.",
      "The bill, which was passed by the lower house of parliament last Thursday, grants the government extensive powers to impose heavy fines and incarcerate social media users for spreading disinformation.",
      "Journalists rallied on Tuesday in the country\u2019s major cities, including Islamabad, Karachi, Faisalabad and Lahore, vowing to resist government efforts aimed at suppressing freedom of speech.",

      "Those failing to comply could face temporary or permanent bans. The law also makes spreading disinformation a criminal offense, punishable by three years in prison and a fine of 2 million rupees ($7,150).",
      "The latest development comes days after National Assembly passed it despite protests by the opposition. On Tuesday, Shibli Faraz, an opposition leader in the Senate, opposed the bill, saying it was being passed in a haste and without consulting all the stake-holders.",
      "Zulfiqar Bukhari, a spokesman for former Prime Minister Imran Khan, said their Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or PTI, would challenge the legislation in the court. \"The bill has been passed from the both houses of the parliament to silence the freedom of expression on the pretext of combating fake news, and no democracy-lover can support it,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Pakistan's media has faced growing censorship in recent years, but the government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif says the law is necessary to limit the spread of disinformation."

      "Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen planned stops in Berlin, Paris and Brussels, the latter to meet NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

      "An Italian navy ship has arrived in Albania with 49 migrants intercepted in international waters for processing of their asylum applications at special Albanian centers",
      "SHENGJIN, Albania -- An Italian navy ship arrived Tuesday in Albania with 49 migrants intercepted in international waters for processing of their asylum applications at special Albanian centers, in the third such attempt following hurdles earlier raised by Italian courts.",
      "Italy's Interior Ministry did not specify the nationality of the migrants brought to the port of Shengjin, 66 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the capital, Tirana, but Italian media said they were from Bangladesh, Egypt, Ivory Coast and Gambia.",
      "The attempt at processing in Albania follows two previous failures in October and November, when Italian judges refused to approve the detention of two small groups at the Albanian centers, built under a contentious agreement between Italy and Albania. The courts ruled that the migrants' countries of origin weren\u2019t safe enough for them to face the possibility of being sent back by the centers.",
      "The cases have been referred to the European Court of Justice, which earlier established that asylum applicants could not undergo a fast-track procedure that could lead to repatriation if their home countries are not deemed completely safe.",
      "The European court hearing on the case is scheduled for Feb. 25.",
      "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni\u2019s government has vowed to reactivate the two centers in Albania after they remained dormant following the Italian courts\u2019 decisions.",
      "Meloni's position was partially backed by a ruling in late December by Italy\u2019s highest court, which said Italian judges could not substitute for government policy in deciding which countries are safe for repatriation of migrants whose asylum requests are rejected.",
      "The decision does allow lower courts to make such determinations on a case-by-case basis, short of setting overall policy.",
      "The migrants are to be checked in at a reception center at the port of Shengjin before being taken to the Gjader accommodation center, about 22 kilometers (14 miles) to the east.",
      "The November 2023 agreement allows up to 3,000 migrants intercepted by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month to be sheltered in Albania and vetted for possible asylum in Italy or repatriation.",
      "Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania.",
      "The agreement to outsource the housing of asylum-seekers to a non-European Union member country has been hailed by some countries which like Italy are experiencing a high level of migrant arrivals, but human rights activists have criticized the deal as setting a dangerous precedent.",
      "So far this year, 3,704 migrants have arrived in Italy, more than double the number in the same period last year, when 1,305 arrived. Last year, 66,317 migrants arrived in Italy, a drop of 58% from the previous year. Most arrived from Bangladesh, followed by Syria, Tunisia and Egypt, according to the Italian Interior Ministry.",

      "The intricate golden Cotofenesti helmet dates back some 2,500 years and is one Romania\u2019s most revered national treasures from the Dacia civilization. It was on display at the small Drents Museum in eastern Netherlands on the last weekend of a 6-month stint when thieves nabbed it.",
      "The theft of the helmet and three golden wristbands also on display sent shockwaves through the art world, and devastated Romanian authorities who thought they were loaning the items to a nation where security for museums was paramount.",
      "\u201cIt is a pitch dark day for us,\u201d museum director Harry Tupan said.",
      "Investigators had found few clues by late Monday beyond a burnt-out car close to the museum, indicating the thieves wanted to cover their tracks.",

Lebanon in turn has accused Israel of hundreds of ceasefire violations.",

      "The surge in visitors has stoked complaints at times from some Spaniards about \u201covertourism, \u201d with concerns about overcrowding, water use and particularly the availability and affordability of housing.",
      "Spain's government has started listening to demands for more regulation, particularly around housing in Spain's big cities, where rising home and rental prices have become a key concern for voters. Earlier this month, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez introduced a 12-part plan to tackle the housing crisis, with measures aimed at bringing stricter regulations to short-term rentals that mainly cater to tourists.",
      "But that doesn't mean Spain is putting the brakes on tourism, an industry that accounts for about 12% of its GDP.",

      "Meanwhile, Barcelona plans to close down all of its 10,000 apartments licensed as short-term rentals in the coming years to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents. The Mediterranean city known for its beaches, art and surrealist architecture announced last year that it would not renew any new tourism apartment licenses after they expire in 2028.",
      "Yes. Tourists can book hotel stays and short-term apartment-style rentals just about anywhere in Spain.",
      "Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas.",
      "Short-term contracts mainly offered for tourists are seen as driving up rental costs for locals, too.",

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia's striking university students on Monday launched a 24-hour blockade of a key traffic intersection in the capital, Belgrade, stepping up pressure on the populist authorities over a deadly canopy collapse in November that killed 15 people.",
      "Serbian farmers on tractors and thousands of citizens joined the blockade that followed weeks of protests demanding accountability of the deadly accident in the northern city of Novi Sad that critics have blamed on rampant government corruption.",
      "A campaign of street demonstrations has posed the biggest challenge in years to the populist government's firm grip on power in Serbia.",
      "Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, at a joint press conference with Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic, later on Monday urged dialogue with the students, saying that \u201cwe need to lower the tensions and start talking to each other.\u201d",
      "Students in the past have refused to meet with Vucic, saying the president is not entitled by the constitution to hold talks with them.",
      "\u201cAny kind of a crisis poses a serious problem for our economy,\u201d said Vucic. \u201cSuch a situation in society is not good for anyone.\u201d",
      "Vucic has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union membership for Serbia. He has accused the students of working for unspecified foreign powers to oust the government.",
      "Several incidents have marked the street demonstrations in the past weeks, including drivers ramming into the crowds on two occasions, when two young women were injured.",
      "Traffic police on Monday secured the student blockade to help avoid any similar incidents. Protesting students set up tents at the protest site, which is a key artery for the city commuters and toward the main north-south motorway.",
      "Some students played volleyball, others sat down on blankets on the pavement or walked around on a warm day. The students also held a daily 15-minute commemoration silence at 11.52, the exact same time when the canopy at a train station in Novi Sad crashed down on Nov. 1.",
      "Many in Serbia believe the huge concrete canopy fell down because of sloppy reconstruction work that resulted from corruption.",
      "Serbia\u2019s prosecutors have filed charges against 13 people, including a government minister and several state officials. But the former construction minister Goran Vesic has been released from detention, fueling doubts over the investigation\u2019s independence.",
      "The main railway station in Novi Sad was renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies."

      "BEIJING -- The top diplomats of China and India called for their nations to provide further mutual support, but avoided publicly mentioning a long-standing border dispute in the Himalayas when they met Monday in Beijing.",
      "Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told top Indian foreign affairs official Vikram Misri that the sides \u201cshould seize the opportunity, meet each other halfway, explore more substantive measures, and strive to understand, support and achieve each other, rather than be suspicious of, alienate and consume each other,\u201d China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency reported.",

Days before that meeting, India announced the two sides had agreed to a pact on military patrols along their disputed border in the Himalayas after a spike in tensions that began with a deadly clash in 2020. That turned into a long-running standoff in the rugged mountainous area, where each side has stationed tens of thousands of military personnel backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets.",

    "story": [
      "Residents of northern Israel are surveying damage and trying to rebuild after the 14-month war between Israel and Hezbollah",
      "KIBBUTZ MANARA, Israel -- Kibbutz Manara in northern Israel is so close to the Lebanese border that patrons of a local pub joke, with gallows humor, that the militant group Hezbollah could see if they were eating sunflower seeds or potato chips with their beers.",
      "The proximity made Manara so vulnerable in the war between Israel and Hezbollah that rockets and explosive drones damaged the majority of homes, turning the tiny community into a symbol of the heavy price of fighting. The kibbutz's 300 residents were among the 60,000 Israelis evacuated by the government from communities along the Lebanese border during the 14-month war.",
      "A tenuous ceasefire has largely held, though it was tested on Sunday as a 60-day deadline passed for Israel and Hezbollah to withdraw their forces from southern Lebanon. Health officials in Lebanon said at least 22 people were killed by Israeli fire when demonstrators attempted to enter villages still under Israeli control. Israel says it is committed to withdrawing but says the process will take additional time.",
      "For now, residents of Israel's north are taking their time returning, uncertain when \u2014 or if \u2014 they will go back to shattered communities. Many wonder what future they can have in a place so exposed to violence. The vast majority of displaced families still haven't returned home.",
      "In hard-hit places like Manara, some who have ventured back have found unlivable, blackened homes. It will take years to rebuild.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to understand what we can fix, what we can do better, how we can prepare for the next round (of fighting),\" said Igor Abramovich, who remained in Manara during the war and believes it's just a matter of time before fighting erupts.",
      "All homes on the ridge facing Lebanon are destroyed, with gaping holes left by missile strikes or fires that burned so hot that cars partly melted. Because the kibbutz is so exposed, 70 meters (yards) from the border in some places, firefighters sometimes couldn\u2019t respond to the blazes. Instead, the emergency squad was forced to watch on security cameras as fires burned.",
      "Hezbollah began launching rockets and missiles toward Israeli border communities on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the deadly Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza. Soon after, Israel evacuated dozens of towns, villages and kibbutzim along the border, including Manara.",
      "In Lebanon, at the height of the war, more than 1 million people were displaced, and reconstruction will take years there as well. Piles of rubble that were once homes can be seen in towns across the border.",
      "Hezbollah rockets killed 77 people in Israel, more than half of them civilians. No one was killed in Manara. Israeli air and ground assaults killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians.",
      "Israel made returning the displaced residents to their homes an aim in its war against Hezbollah and has promised incentives to entice them back. The return has been slow, in part because many residents are skeptical of the government's pledges to ensure their safety and because much work remains to rehabilitate communities.",
      "Manara is prone to howling winds and snow usually once a winter, attracting a hardy, close-knit group of people.",
      "Such remote kibbutzim were an integral element of the Israeli pioneer ethos, and Israel as a fledgling state once relied on them to protect its borders in the face of threats from neighboring Arab countries. Those threats appeared to have waned until Hamas attacked into southern Israel and Israeli authorities assessed that Hezbollah was planning a similar cross-border raid in the north.",
      "The war was a clear reminder for Israelis that the country still depends on the border communities and needs to ensure their viability so that the country doesn't collapse toward its center.",
      "Many in Manara are determined to return and restore their homes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a physical thing. They miss the air here,\u201d said Orna Weinberg, 58, who has lived on the kibbutz her entire life.",
      "Weinberg was displaced to a town about 45 minutes south, but she coordinated with the army and returned to Manara almost every day during the war, helping other evacuated residents who asked her to save photo albums, transfer the kibbutz\u2019s archives or carry out other tasks to keep the community from falling apart.",
      "Now she\u2019s involved in coordinating Manara's rehabilitation, both physical and emotional. She and Abramovich spend hours walking through the kibbutz with appraisers for different government agencies to determine the financial losses and compensation. They also need to check the kibbutz\u2019s infrastructure, including gas, water and electricity lines. All suffered damage.",
      "Out of 157 homes or apartments in the kibbutz, 110 were damaged, including 38 that were completely destroyed. In the part of Manara that faces Lebanon, all houses were destroyed. The ones facing the valley and the city of Kiryat Shmona are damaged but likely salvageable.",
      "Abramovich said an initial estimate of rebuilding costs is at least NIS 150 million ($40 million).",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re having this weird discussion now, who has it better, someone whose house is partially destroyed or totally destroyed,\u201d said Hagar Erlich, 72, whose father was one of Manara's founders and is living in a hotel in the city of Tiberias with other kibbutz members. It may be cheaper and faster to demolish and rebuild rather than renovate, she said.",
      "The kibbutz is committed to reopening the nursery school by Sept. 1, convinced that if young families don\u2019t return as soon as possible, the community's future is in danger, Abramovich said.",
      "So far, none of Manara\u2019s residents have announced they are leaving. The Ambramovich family \u2014 Igor, his wife and two daughters \u2014 will return in February, the first family to do so.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to say, \u2018I\u2019m not coming back,\u2019\u201d Erlich said. \u201cWe decided that we are not asking that question, not as an organization, and not as individuals.\u201d",
      "The community even wants to continue an expansion of 92 housing units that was planned before the war started.",
      "Signs of life are reemerging.",
      "In late December, 50 Manara residents gathered to work in the community garden, the hub of the kibbutz where they mark important celebrations and gatherings. The older members cooked a feast as children ran through the weeds and removed rocks from the garden beds to get them ready for new plants.",
      "\u201cIt was the first time since the war began where I heard voices of people talking and chatting around here,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cWhenever I think about that, that\u2019s home.\u201d"

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Skyscraper-studded Dubai has been on a hot streak for the last five years \u2014 and some residents are starting to feel burned.",
      "The city-state has seen record-breaking real estate transactions and as more and more people come to live there, and its state-owned airline Emirates is booking record earnings. But all that growth comes with strains for the city's population.",
      "Traffic feels worse than ever on Dubai's roads. The price of housing continues to spike even with new real estate projects being announced almost daily. Caught in the middle are both its Emirati citizens and the vast population of foreigners who power its economy \u2014 sparking rare public expressions of concern.",
      "\u201cDubai is on steroids but affordability risks are increasing,\u201d warned Hasnain Malik in a starkly titled report he wrote for the global data firm Tellimer, where he's a managing director.",
      "Under Dubai's current plans, the city aims to have 5.8 million residents by 2040, adding more than half its current estimated population in just 15 years. Since 1980, its population has already soared from around 255,000 to around 3.8 million.",
      "Real estate lit the fire in Dubai's growth in 2002, when the desert sheikdom began allowing foreigners to own property. After sharp falls during both the 2008-2009 financial crisis and Dubai's brief coronavirus lockdown, prices have been soaring.",
      "Today, average prices per square foot are at all-time highs, according to Property Monitor. Rental prices increased as much as 20% in key neighborhoods last year, with further rises likely this year, with some residents moving to communities further out in the desert, the real estate firm Engel & V\u00f6lkers said.",
      "Even before the boom, some people who worked in Dubai chose to live in the neighboring emirate of Sharjah, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the city's downtown, or further away. Some 1 million commuters from other emirates jam the 12-lane Sheikh Zayed Road that runs through the center of the city and other highways every day, as studies suggest that as many as four out of five employees drive to work alone.",
      "That traffic has only intensified with Dubai's new arrivals.",
      "While the rest of the world saw as much as a 4% increase in the number of registered vehicles in the last two years, the city's Road and Transportation Authority says there's been a 10% increase in the number of vehicles.",
      "So many vehicles have been registered that the city has had to make license plates longer.",
      "And while the city keeps building new flyovers and other road improvements, more cars are coming from more directions than ever before.",
      "\u201cDubai is very attractive, more and more people are coming,\u201d said Thomas Edelmann, the founder and managing director of RoadSafetyUAE, which advocates about traffic issues. \u201cI think it\u2019s easier to get people quickly to come to Dubai and to convince them about Dubai, then to build a new intersection or a new highway.\u201d",
      "Congestion has got so bad that it's driving even prominent Emiratis to break their customary silence on public affairs.",
      "Habib Al Mulla, a prominent Emirati lawyer, wrote on the social platform X in December that while authorities were working on congestion, the problem demanded \u201ca set of immediate and long-term mechanisms.\u201d He followed up by publishing an opinion piece twice mentioning \u201ccongestion\u201d as being among \u201cpressing issues\" for global cities like Dubai.",
      "While phrased in mild language, Al Mulla\u2019s comments represented rare public criticism in the United Arab Emirates, where speech is tightly controlled by criminal law and social norms favor raising issues at a \u201cmajlis\u201d \u2014 a semiprivate setting convened by a traditional ruler.",
      "\u201cThe concentration of wealth and opportunities created in global cities may cause income inequality that pushes out lower-income residents,\u201d Al Mulla warned in the English-language Khaleej Times newspaper on Jan. 15.",
      "\u201cThe problem becomes acute when the wealth and opportunities remain inaccessible to segments of the national population who witness the city\u2019s allure being seized by outsiders. This may carry significant social risks, if not mitigated.\u201d",
      "Then there's demographic concerns as the Emirati share of the population dwindles. While the number of citizens isn't public, a back-of-the-envelope, informal calculation shared for years by experts suggests Emirati citizens represent around 10% of the country's overall population of more than 9 million people, a number that's likely falling as foreigners rush in.",
      "In December, sermon scripts issued for the Dec. 13 Friday's prayers directly touched on the duty of having more children.",
      "\u201cIncreasing offspring is both a religious obligation and a national responsibility, as it contributes to the protection and sustainability of nations,\u201d the sermon read, according to a transcript issued by the federal government's General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments.",
      "For Dubai's autocratic government, overseen by ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, possible solutions to the grinding traffic have ranged from the practical to the fanciful. The government in recent months has repeatedly encouraged companies to allow more remote work options, including in a report released in November that also suggested staggered and flexible working hours.",
      "Adding as many as five remote workdays a month, along with the other steps, \u201ccan reduce morning peak travel time across Dubai by 30%,\u201d the study stated.",
      "Dubai's road toll system, known as Salik, has added gates to charge drivers more and will institute surge pricing at the end of the month. Dubai's Metro, which boasts the world's longest self-driving rail line, will also grow beyond its broadly north-south routes in a nearly $5 billion expansion.",
      "Then there's the flying taxi project. Since 2017, Dubai has been announcing plans for airborne cabs in the city. A first \u201cvertiport\u201d is being built by Dubai International Airport with the aim of offering the service from next year.",
      "Dubai also plans 3,300 kilometers (2,050 miles) of new pedestrian paths, although during Dubai's summer months pedestrians have to contend with high humidity and heat of around 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cIn the coming years, residents of Dubai will be able to move around by walking, cycling, its extensive network of roads and bridges, the Metro and its new lines, water taxis, or flying taxis on specific air routes,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed said on X in December.",
      "But for now, Dubai keeps attracting more people and more cars \u2014 and the traffic jams only get longer."

      "Crown, an imprint of Penguin Random House, announced the book Tuesday. The title and release date are still to be determined.",
      "\u201cIn this candid work, he will offer the first inside story from within the administration on what really transpired in the run up to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the difficult choices that shaped American diplomatic and military support in the months that followed in a war that would bring the world as close to nuclear conflict as it had come in more than half a century,\u201d Crown's statement reads in part.",

      "Blinken, 62, is a State Department and National Security Council veteran whose service dates back to the Clinton administration. He was a foreign policy adviser to Joe Biden during the 2020 election and was secretary of state through all four years of the Biden administration, a time of conflicts around the world.",
      "Blinken and the Biden administration were often criticized for their handling of the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and for their support for Israel in its war against Hamas. Critics and protesters contended they did not impose meaningful restrictions on weapons shipments to Israel or push its ally hard enough to ease a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Protesters interrupted his final State Department briefing and at other times gathered outside of his home.",
      "In an Associated Press interview on his last workday, Blinken said that he hoped his legacy would include building \u201ca new and stronger foundation for the United States in the world for the future.\u201d He also acknowledged sharp differences with the incoming Trump administration over Biden's support for Ukraine and the NATO alliance, among other issues.",
      "\u201cWhen we came in, we inherited partnerships and alliances that were seriously frayed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if past is prologue, yes, it would be a concern.\u201d",
      "Terms for Blinken's deal were not disclosed. Negotiations were handled by Esther Newberg of the Creative Artists Agency, which also has worked with Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris."

      "WASHINGTON -- Boeing posted a fourth-quarter loss of $3.8 billion on Tuesday as a machinists strike and other problems continued to plague the troubled aircraft manufacturer.",
      "Boeing has lost more than $35 billion since 2019 following the crashes of two then-new Max jets that killed 346 people. For the full year 2024, Boeing logged a loss of $11.8 billion.",
      "The numbers Boeing released are in line with what the company pre-reported last week, including nearly $3 billion worth of charges in the period due to the labor stoppage, job cuts and problems with a number of government programs.",
      "Boeing's loss per share was $5.46 per share, well above the $3.08 loss that Wall Street analysts expected, according to the data firm FactSet.",
      "The fourth quarter caps a rough year for Boeing. A strike by the machinists who assemble the best-selling 737 Max, along with the 777 jet and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington, halted production at those facilities and hampered Boeing\u2019s delivery capability.",
      "The walkout ended after more than seven weeks when the company agreed to pay raises and improved benefits.",
      "The company reiterated much of what it reported in last week's release, including that it took charges totaling $1.1 billion related to the 777 and 767 programs in the fourth quarter. Boeing took an additional $1.7 billion in charges related to a number of government programs including a military refueling tanker and Air Force One replacement jets.",
      "Boeing said revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $15.2 billion, below analysts\u2019 updated estimate of $15.7 billion, according to FactSet. Full-year revenue came in at $66.5 billion, a 14$ decline from 2023.",
      "As it also reported earlier this month, Boeing said it supplied 348 jetliners last year, more than a third fewer than the 528 the company finished for airlines and leasing outfits in 2023 and less than half the number of jetliners that Airbus delivered last year.",
      "Deliveries are an important source of cash for plane manufacturers since buyers typically pay a large portion of the purchase price when their orders are fulfilled.",
      "More than three-quarters of the planes that Boeing furnished were 737 Max jets, a reminder of how integral its best-selling airline model has been to the company\u2019s fortunes and challenges.",
      "The company had expected to ramp up production in 2024 until a panel called a door plug blew off a 737 Max shortly after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, in early January. In the wake of the incident aboard an Alaska Airlines flight, the Federal Aviation Administration capped production of Max jets until Boeing could convince federal regulators it had corrected manufacturing quality and safety issues.",
      "The hit to the company\u2019s finances and reputation extended to sales of new aircraft. Boeing received no 737 Max orders for at least two months and ended the year far behind Airbus in total net orders for commercial planes, an indicator that factors in cancellations.",
      "Shares of Boeing Co, based in Arlington, Va., nudged up less than 1% before the opening bell.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 07:22:17 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump has already forced Colombia to accept deportees by threatening tariffs and is readying the same move against Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has already forced Colombia to accept deportees by threatening tariffs and is readying the same move against Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday",
      "WASHINGTON -- Having already forced Colombia to accept deportees by threatening a 25% tariff, President Donald Trump is readying the same move against Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday.",
      "But this time, the stakes are higher and many economists surveying the possible damage doubt Trump would be comfortable with what they say would be self-inflicted wounds from the tariffs.",
      "\u201cThe potential for such sizable economic impacts ought to act as enough of a deterrent that Trump will not end up implementing these higher tariffs,\u201d said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics.",
      "Trump has repeatedly insisted that tariffs are coming on Canada and Mexico, despite both countries seeking to address his stated concerns about illegal border crossings and the smuggling of fentanyl. But the Republican president is also motivated by the idea that tariffs would force other countries to \u201crespect\u201d the United States.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to immediately install massive tariffs,\" Trump said in a Monday speech, adding, \u201cColombia is traditionally a very, very strong-willed country,\u201d but it backed down rather than face import taxes.",
      "Multiple economic analyses show that universal tariffs against Canada and Mexico risk more inflation and an economic slowdown. It's a much larger play than Trump's moves against Colombia, which accounts for roughly 0.5% of U.S. imports. By contrast, nearly 30% of all U.S. imports hail from Canada and Mexico, amplifying the risk that tariffs could fuel inflation and undermine Trump's campaign promises to get prices under control.",
      "Trump's director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, dismissed these concerns. He said the skeptical analyses of tariffs don't look at the totality of Trump's promises.",
      "\u201cWhen the people who are trying to cause panic over President Trump\u2019s trade policy simulate what it\u2019s going to do, they don\u2019t account for all the other policies,\u201d Hassett said in a Monday interview on the Fox Business Network. \u201cSo President Trump is drill, baby, drill, and deregulate and tax cuts and reduce spending.\u201d",
      "After Trump\u2019s initial threat of 25% tariffs in November, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own. Since then, she has been more measured, choosing to emphasize the strong bilateral relationship and willingness to engage in dialogue as the number of detentions at the U.S.-Mexico border has plunged.",
      "Sheinbaum pointed out in November that drugs were a U.S. problem, but in December the Mexican military seized more than a ton of fentanyl pills in two raids, calling it the biggest catch of synthetic opioids in Mexico\u2019s history.",
      "On Monday, Sheinbaum applauded the agreement reached by the Trump administration and Colombia.",
      "\u201cI believe the important thing, as I said on the first day, is to always act with a cool head, defending each country\u2019s sovereignty and the respect among nations and peoples,\u201d she said.",
      "Top Canadian ministers said last week that Canada was prepared to retaliate if Trump imposed import taxes, even as Canadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said they \u201cwill continue to work on preventing tariffs.\u201d The working theory in Canada appears to involve being ready for anything that the U.S. president might do.",
      "On Monday, the economics division of the insurance company Nationwide estimated that Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico would increase inflation by as much as 0.5 percentage points and pull down growth by 0.7 percentage points.",
      "The analysis noted it did not \u201caccount for potential retaliatory tariffs from Canada or Mexico, which could amplify the deleterious impact on inflation and GDP growth.\u201d",
      "Trump has made lower gasoline prices one of his key strategies for tackling inflation, but tariffs on Canada could drive up prices at the pump unless Trump creates carveouts in his plan.",
      "\u201cFor example, 60% of oil and gas imports come from Canada,\" said Oxford Economics' Martin. \"A 25% tariff would lead to higher gasoline, diesel, and petroleum product prices for households and firms, especially in the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions, where refineries are connected to Canada by pipeline.\u201d",
      "The tax services firm PwC looked at the possible impact of 25% tariffs and found that companies importing from Canada could have to pay $106 billion more annually in import taxes and those importing from Mexico could owe $131 billion more.",
      "\u201cWhen we think about hardest-hit industries, we think about transportation and automotive,\u201d said Chris Desmond, a principal at PwC's international trade practice. \u201cThe amount of companies that have operations in Mexico and Canada in that industry with components and parts as well, including even airplanes, that\u2019s going to be a huge hit.\u201d",
      "Desmond estimates that taxes paid on imports in the transportation sector from all of Trump's tariff plans, which include new taxes on China and other countries, could increase from $4 billion a year to $68 billion. It's unclear how companies would absorb those costs or possibly pass them along to consumers.",
      "None of those analyses is at the forefront of Trump's public thoughts. His argument is that tariffs would make the U.S. wealthy by sheltering it from competition and safer because they could be tools to force other countries to reduce illegal immigration.",
      "\u201cTariffs, I told you, most beautiful word in the dictionary,\u201d Trump said Monday as he recalled his campaign speeches praising the import taxes. He reminisced in that speech how he was criticized for praising the term, prompting him to conclude that tariff is, in fact, the fourth most beautiful word after \u201cGod, love, religion.\u201d"

      "It wasn't immediately clear what caused the fire in the Red Sea, which has been repeatedly targeted by attacks from the Houthis. The rebels said last week they were was limiting their assaults following a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis did not immediately acknowledge the fire incident.",
      "The vessel was abandoned and the crew later rescued unharmed, another maritime industry official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as authorization hadn't been given to speak publicly about the incident.",
      "The official described the cargo aboard the vessel as \u201cdangerous,\u201d without immediately elaborating. The name of the vessel wasn't released.",
      "The Red Sea is home to coral and marine life that previously has been threatened by burning ships from the Houthi campaign and the threat of wider oil spills.",
      "The Houthi attacks, which began in November 2023, have halved the number of ships passing through the Red Sea corridor, a crucial route for energy shipments and cargo moving between Asia and Europe. Despite the pledge by the Houthis to limit their attacks, shippers broadly are still shying away from the route over the risks.",
      "Some $1 trillion worth of trade passed through the region each year before the attacks."

The automaker is also taking a proactive approach with the United States government on regulations and doling out generous profit-sharing payouts to thousands of workers.",
      "Last month GM cautioned that the poor performance of its Chinese joint ventures would force it to write down assets and take a restructuring charge totaling more than $5 billion in the fourth quarter.",
      "China has become an increasingly difficult market for foreign automakers, with BYD and other domestic companies raising the quality of their vehicles and reducing costs. The country has subsidized its automakers.",

      "President Donald Trump's second White House is looking a lot like the inside of Mar-a-Lago, with extremely wealthy Americans taking key roles in his Republican administration",
      "ATLANTA -- President Donald Trump\u2019s brash populism has always involved incongruence: the billionaire businessman-politician stirring the passions of millions who, regardless of the U.S. economy\u2019s trajectory, could never afford to live in his Manhattan skyscraper or visit his club in south Florida.",
      "His second White House is looking a lot like the inside of Mar-a-Lago, with extremely wealthy Americans taking key roles in his Republican administration.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man, Elon Musk, is overseeing a new Department of Government Efficiency. Billionaires or mega-millionaires are lined up to run the treasury, commerce, interior and education departments, NASA and the Small Business Administration, and fill key foreign posts.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s bringing in folks who have had great success in the private sector,\u201d said Debbie Dooley, an early 2015 Trump supporter and onetime national organizer in the anti-establishment Tea Party movement. \u201cIf you need to have brain surgery, you want the proven brain surgeons.\u201d",
      "Others raise concerns about conflicts of interest at odds with Trump\u2019s pledge to fight for \u201cforgotten men and women\u201d in a country where the median household net worth is about $193,000 and median annual household income is about $81,000.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to conceive how the wealthiest set of Cabinet nominees and White House appointments in history will understand what average working people are going through,\u201d said former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who served under President Bill Clinton and has warned for decades about the nation\u2019s widening wealth and wage gaps.",
      "Countered Dooley: \u201cTrump sets the agenda. If they won\u2019t enact his policies, then they will hear him say what we hear on \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 all the time: \u2018You\u2019re fired!\u2019\u201d",
      "Here is a closer look at some of Trump\u2019s picks, their net worth according to Forbes, and what the choices could mean:",
      "Musk (net worth estimated above $400 billion) is chairing the new Department of Government Efficiency, which is a special commission charged with slashing federal spending. The extensive ties his businesses have to the government have raised questions about Musk's potential conflicts in the role.",
      "McMahon was picked to be Trump's secretary of education. She is the wife of Vince McMahon, who is worth at least $3 billion.",
      "The former WWE wrestling executive will lead an agency that many conservatives have called for abolishing altogether. While that\u2019s a heavy lift politically, McMahon and Trump have endorsed an expansion of \u201cschool choice,\u201d programs that steer taxpayer money to private school tuition. She also could be in charge of implementing Trump\u2019s proposals to withhold federal money from public schools \u2014 K-12 and higher education \u2014 that do not meet White House demands to modify or scrap diversity programs.",
      "The North Dakota governor (estimated net worth $1.1 billion) made his money as a software entrepreneur. Burgum impressed Trump during his own failed bid for the GOP\u2019s 2024 presidential nomination. As interior secretary, Burgum would be charged with implementing Trump\u2019s \u201cDrill, baby, drill\u201d promise \u2014 making it even easier for energy companies to tap fossil fuel resources, including from public lands.",
      "Forbes has not yet identified Bessent as a billionaire, but the veteran hedge fund manager confirmed Monday as treasury secretary certainly is worth many hundreds of millions. At Treasury, he will play key roles in selling and implementing a number of Trump\u2019s signature policies: reinstating the 2017 tax cuts tilted to corporations and wealthy individuals, imposing tariffs on many imports and cutting taxes on overtime wages, Social Security benefits and tip income.",
      "Reich, the former labor secretary, noted that Bessent and his fellow wealthy Cabinet designees stand to benefit personally from Trump\u2019s tax ideas. Trump tax policies, which helped widen the deficit in Trump\u2019s first term, are juxtaposed with Bessent\u2019s warnings about the dangers of rising U.S. debt and the cost of annual interest payments to the government\u2019s bond holders.",
      "An apparent runner-up to head Treasury, Lutnick (estimated net worth $1.5 billion) has been nominated to be secretary of commerce. Lutnick, who made his fortune as a financial services executive, is still slated for a high-profile post that will put him at the center of Trump\u2019s promised trade wars with China and other nations, including Mexico and Canada. Commerce also oversees several agencies, including the Census Bureau, whose calculations are key to determining the funding distributions of programs across the federal government.",
      "The Georgia businesswoman named to lead the Small Business Administration was the wealthiest member of the Senate during her brief stay on Capitol Hill. Loeffler is married to Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, the publicly traded firm that owns the New York Stock Exchange. That\u2019s not the center of commerce for the SBA\u2019s usual clientele. The agency was founded in 1953 and describes itself as \u201cthe only cabinet-level federal agency fully dedicated to small business\u201d by providing \u201ccounseling, capital, and contracting expertise as the nation\u2019s only go-to resource and voice for small businesses.\u201d",
      "As a senator, Loeffler faced ethics complaints over alleged insider trading tied to stock trades she and her husband made as members of Congress first started receiving briefings related to the coronavirus pandemic. The trades occurred weeks before the pandemic caused markets to plummet. Justice Department and Senate inquiries later found no wrongdoing on Loeffler\u2019s part.",
      "Isaacman, another financial services billionaire, was the first wealthy individual to take a space walk through Musk\u2019s company, SpaceX. This choice, as much as any, illustrates Trump\u2019s lean to the wealthy private sector, given that billionaires like Musk and Amazon chief Jeff Bezos are now competing in a space sector that was once the province of the federal government and the agency that Isaacman would lead as NASA administrator."

      "TOKYO -- Asian shares were mixed in thin Lunar New Year trading on Tuesday after Wall Street\u2019s tech superstars tumbled as a competitor from China raised doubts over the recent artificial-intelligence market frenzy.",
      "Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 1.5% to 38,959.05. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed, inching down 0.1% to 8,399.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.1% to 20,225.11. Markets in South Korea, Shanghai markets and other parts of the region were closed for holidays.",

He has subsequently announced his retirement.",
      "On Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 1.5% to 6,012.28, dragged down in large part by a 16.9% fall for Nvidia. Other Big Tech stocks also took heavy losses, pulling the Nasdaq composite down 3.1% to 19,341.83 for its worst loss in more than a month.",
      "The damage was focused on AI-related stocks, while the rest of the market held up much better. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% to 44,713.58, and the majority of U.S. stocks climbed. But anyone holding an S&P 500 index fund, which are found in many 401(k) accounts, felt the pain because of how influential those tech giants have become on indexes.",
      "The shock to financial markets came from China, where an AI company called DeepSeek unveiled a large language model that can compete with U.S. giants but at potentially a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek had already hit the top of the chart for free apps on Apple\u2019s App Store by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat was particularly impressive given how the U.S. government has restricted Chinese access to top AI chips.",
      "It's unclear, however, how much DeepSeek\u2019s announcement will ultimately shake the economy that\u2019s built around the AI industry, from the chip makers making semiconductors to the utilities hoping to electrify vast data centers gobbling up computing power.",
      "\u201cIt remains to be seen if DeepSeek found a way to work around these chip restrictions rules and what chips they ultimately used as there will be many skeptics around this issue given the information is coming from China,\u201d according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s disruption nevertheless rocked AI-related stocks worldwide.",
      "It\u2019s a sharp turnaround for the AI winners, which had soared in recent years on hopes that all the investment pouring in would remake the global economy and deliver gargantuan profits along the way. Such stellar performances also raised criticism that their stock prices had gone too far, too fast.",
      "Before Monday\u2019s drop, which was its worst since the 2020 COVID crash, Nvidia\u2019s stock had soared from less than $20 to more than $140 in less than two years, for example.",
      "A small group of seven such companies has become so dominant that they alone accounted for more than half the S&P 500\u2019s total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. They include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.",
      "Their immense sizes give them huge sway over the S&P 500 and other indexes that give more weight to bigger companies.",
      "Markets are also awaiting earnings reports later this week from Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla.",

      "It looks like grocery shoppers hoping for soaring egg prices to turn around are likely to be waiting a while",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Bird flu is forcing farmers to slaughter millions of chickens a month, pushing U.S. egg prices to more than double their cost in the summer of 2023. And it appears there may be no relief in sight, given the surge in demand as Easter approaches.",
      "The average price per dozen nationwide hit $4.15 in December. That's not quite as high as the $4.82 record set two years ago, but the Agriculture Department predicts prices are going to soar another 20% this year.",
      "Shoppers in some parts of the country are already paying more than double the average price, or worse, finding empty shelves in their local grocery stores. Organic and cage-free varieties are even more expensive.",
      "Some grocery stores have even limited how many eggs shoppers can buy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just robbery,\u201d said Minneapolis resident Sage Mills, who bought eggs to bake a birthday cake last week. \u201cEggs used to be kind of a staple food for us, but now you know, you might as well just go out to eat.\"",
      "The bird flu outbreak that started in 2022 is the main reason egg prices are up so much.",
      "Anytime the virus is found on a poultry farm, the entire flock is slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. And with massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can cause a supply crunch.",
      "The problem tends to linger because it takes months to dispose of all the carcasses, disinfect barns and bring in new birds.",
      "More than 145 million chickens, turkeys and other birds have been slaughtered since the current outbreak began, with the vast majority of them being egg-laying chickens.",
      "Cage-free egg laws in 10 states may also be responsible for some supply disruptions and price increases. The laws set minimum space for chickens or cage-free requirements for egg-laying hens. They\u2019ve already gone into effect in California, Massachusetts, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Michigan. At a Target in Chicago on Monday, a dozen large conventional eggs cost $4.49 but a dozen large cage-free eggs were selling for $6.19.",
      "Bird flu is primarily spread by wild birds such as ducks and geese as they migrate. While it is fatal to a variety of animals, those species can generally carry it without getting sick, which offers the virus a chance to mutate and thrive.",
      "The virus can be spread through droppings or any interaction between farm-raised poultry and wild birds. It's also easily tracked into a farm on someone's boots or by vehicle.",
      "Unlike previous outbreaks, the one that began in 2022 didn't die out in high summer temperatures.",
      "The virus found another new host when dairy cattle started getting sick last March. That creates more opportunities for the virus to linger and spread and unlike poultry, cattle aren\u2019t slaughtered when they get sick because they rarely die from bird flu.",
      "More than five dozen people have also become ill with bird flu and one person died since last March. Nearly all of them worked around sick animals. Health officials haven\u2019t yet found evidence of the disease spreading from person to person.",
      "Farmers go to great lengths to protect their flocks.",
      "Many poultry farms installed truck washes to disinfect vehicles entering their property and require workers to shower and change clothes before stepping inside a barn. They have also invested in duplicate sets of tools so nothing used in one barn is shared.",
      "Some poultry farmers have even invested in lasers that shoot beams of green light in random patterns to discourage ducks and geese from landing.",
      "Dairy farmers isolate any sick cattle and do additional testing before moving animals off the farm \u2014 especially if there has been a nearby outbreak or if the cows are being sent to a meat processing plant. The government is also testing milk.",
      "Future vaccines might help, but it's not practical to vaccinate millions of chickens through shots, and other countries might refuse to purchase meat from vaccinated birds.",
      "Health officials emphasize that any sick birds or cattle are kept out of the food supply. Cooking meat to 165 degrees (74 Celsius) kills bird flu, E. coli, salmonella or anything else. Pasteurization also kills the virus in milk. Raw milk is the only food product linked to illnesses so far.",
      "It is impossible to know how much farmers have spent to seal barns, build shower houses for workers or to adopt other biosecurity measures.",
      "\u201cOver the last five years, my small farm alone has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on biosecurity,\u201d said Minnesota turkey farmer Loren Brey. \u201cBut not only that, it's the time daily that you're attending to biosecurity.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has spent at least $1.14 billion compensating farmers for the birds they have had to kill. A similar number wasn't immediately available for how much has been spent to aid dairies.",
      "USDA spokeswoman Shilo Weir said the department also spent more than $576 million on its own response.",
      "The prices of turkey, milk and chicken have also seen some pressure from bird flu.",
      "Mike Vickers, a manager at Sentyrz Liquor & Supermarket in Minneapolis, said he can\u2019t even stock any organic, cage-free or brown eggs right now and is limited instead to selling large or jumbo eggs. He understands the pain customers are feeling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in my life that I\u2019ve ever had to be kind of embarrassed on what I'm selling eggs for,\" he said. \"And it\u2019s not our fault. We\u2019re paying today $7.45 for a dozen eggs. We\u2019re selling for $7.59. We\u2019re making $0.14. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t pay the bills.\u201d",

      "A frenzy over an artificial intelligence chatbot made by Chinese tech startup DeepSeek was upending stock markets Monday and fueling debates over the economic and geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China in developing AI technology.",
      "DeepSeek's AI assistant became the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple's iPhone store Monday, propelled by curiosity about the ChatGPT competitor. Part of what's worrying some U.S. tech industry observers is the idea that the Chinese startup has caught up with the American companies at the forefront of generative AI at a fraction of the cost.",
      "That, if true, calls into question the huge amounts of money U.S. tech companies say they plan to spend on the data centers and computer chips needed to power further AI advancements.",
      "But hype and misconceptions about DeepSeek's technological advancements also sowed confusion.",
      "\"The models they built are fantastic, but they aren't miracles either,\" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who follows the semiconductor industry and was one of several stock analysts describing Wall Street's reaction as overblown.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not using any innovations that are unknown or secret or anything like that,\" Rasgon said. \"These are things that everybody\u2019s experimenting with.\u201d",
      "The startup DeepSeek was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China and released its first AI large language model later that year. Its CEO Liang Wenfeng previously co-founded one of China's top hedge funds, High-Flyer, which focuses on AI-driven quantitative trading. The fund, by 2022, had amassed a cluster of 10,000 of California-based Nvidia's high-performance A100 graphics processor chips that are used to build and run AI systems, according to a post that summer on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. soon after restricted sales of those chips to China.",
      "DeepSeek has said its recent models were built with Nvidia\u2019s lower-performing H800 chips, which are not banned in China, sending a message that the fanciest hardware might not be needed for cutting-edge AI research.",
      "DeepSeek began attracting more attention in the AI industry last month when it released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and was more cost-effective in its use of expensive Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data. The chatbot became more widely accessible when it appeared on Apple and Google app stores early this year.",
      "But it was a follow-up research paper published last week \u2014 on the same day as President Donald Trump's inauguration \u2014 that set in motion the panic that followed. That paper was about another DeepSeek AI model called R1 that showed advanced \u201creasoning\u201d skills \u2014 such as the ability to rethink its approach to a math problem \u2014 and was significantly cheaper than a similar model sold by OpenAI called o1.",
      "\u201cWhat their economics look like, I have no idea,\u201d Rasgon said. \u201cBut I think the price points freaked people out.\u201d",
      "Behind the drama over DeepSeek's technical capabilities is a debate within the U.S. over how best to compete with China on AI.",
      "\u201cDeepseek R1 is AI\u2019s Sputnik moment,\u201d said venture capitalist Marc Andreessen in a Sunday post on social platform X, referencing the 1957 satellite launch that set off a Cold War space exploration race between the Soviet Union and the U.S.",
      "Andreessen, who has advised Trump on tech policy, has warned that overregulation of the AI industry by the U.S. government will hinder American companies and enable China to get ahead.",
      "But the attention on DeepSeek also threatens to undermine a key strategy of U.S. foreign policy in recent years to restrict the sale of American-designed AI semiconductors to China. Some experts on U.S.-China relations don't think that is an accident.",
      "\u201cThe technology innovation is real, but the timing of the release is political in nature,\u201d said Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Allen compared DeepSeek's announcement last week to U.S.-sanctioned Chinese company Huawei's release of a new phone during diplomatic discussions over Biden administration export controls in 2023.",
      "\u201cTrying to show that the export controls are futile or counterproductive is a really important goal of Chinese foreign policy right now,\u201d Allen said.",
      "Trump signed an order on his first day in office last week that said his administration would \u201cidentify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls,\u201d signaling that he is likely to continue and harden Biden's approach.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s stock dropped 17% Monday, but the company in a statement commended DeepSeek\u2019s work as \u201can excellent AI advancement\u201d that leveraged \u201cwidely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.\u201d",
      "One thing that distinguishes DeepSeek from competitors such as OpenAI is that its models are \u201copen source\u201d \u2014 meaning key components are free for anyone to access and modify, though the company hasn\u2019t disclosed the data it used for training.",
      "But what's attracted the most admiration about DeepSeek's R1 model is what Nvidia calls a \"perfect example of Test Time Scaling\" \u2014 or when AI models effectively show their train of thought, and then use that for further training without having to feed them new sources of data.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just thinking out loud, basically,\u201d said Lennart Heim, a researcher at Rand Corp.",
      "OpenAI's reasoning models, starting with o1, do the same, and it's likely that other U.S.-based competitors such as Anthropic and Google have similar capabilities that haven't been released, Heim said.",
      "But \u201cit\u2019s the first time that we see a Chinese company being that close within a relatively short time period. I think that\u2019s why a lot of people pay attention to it,\u201d Heim said. \u201cI used to believe OpenAI was the leader, the king of the hill, and that nobody could catch up. Turns out this is not completely the case.\u201d"

Earlier this month, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez introduced a 12-part plan to tackle the housing crisis, with measures aimed at bringing stricter regulations to short-term rentals that mainly cater to tourists.",

      "Malaga, an Andalusian port city on the southern Mediterranean coast of Spain, will prohibit new rental properties in 43 neighborhoods of the city where those rentals exceed 8% of the residential stock. The policy went into effect earlier this month and will be tested for three years.",
      "Meanwhile, Barcelona plans to close down all of its 10,000 apartments licensed as short-term rentals in the coming years to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents. The Mediterranean city known for its beaches, art and surrealist architecture announced last year that it would not renew any new tourism apartment licenses after they expire in 2028.",
      "Yes. Tourists can book hotel stays and short-term apartment-style rentals just about anywhere in Spain.",
      "Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas.",
      "Short-term contracts mainly offered for tourists are seen as driving up rental costs for locals, too.",
      "Visitors renting a car in Spain or booking hotel stays will also have to file more paperwork thanks to a new law that requires hotel owners and car rental companies to send personal information to the government for national security reasons.",
      "Passport details, home addresses and payment information used by travelers above 14 are among the details that will be collected."

      "An asset manager is seeking to quash Nippon Steel's takeover of U.S. Steel and oust the leadership of the U.S. steelmaker after taking a stake in the company.",
      "Ancora Holdings Group, with $10 billion in assets, reported acquiring a 0.18% stake in the Pittsburgh company. It said Monday that U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt and the company's board have prioritized a sale to Nippon because they stand to receive more than $100 million if it goes forward.",
      "President Joe Biden blocked the nearly $15 billion acquisition this month \u2014 affirming an earlier vow to prevent the acquisition of Steeltown USA\u2019s most storied steel company.",

      "Ancora is seeking an independent slate of directors at U.S. Steel and new CEO that are committed to walking away from the Nippon deal. In an open letter on Monday, the firm said it has nominated nine independent directors for election at U.S. Steel's annual shareholders meeting this year. Those directors have a plan that includes making Alan Kestenbaum, a former steel executive, the new chief executive of U.S. Steel.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is nearly certain to keep its key interest rate unchanged at its policy meeting this week, just a few days after President Donald Trump said he would soon demand lower rates",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is nearly certain to keep its key interest rate unchanged at its policy meeting this week, just a few days after President Donald Trump said he would soon demand lower rates.",
      "Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have cut their rate for three meetings in a row, to about 4.3%, from a two-decade high of 5.3%. Yet with several recent economic reports showing healthy hiring and some progress on inflation, policymakers have said that the pace of rate cuts will slow this year. Some have suggested that few reductions are needed at all.",
      "While the two-day meeting that ends Wednesday may be uneventful, it nevertheless kicks off what is likely to be a turbulent year for the Fed. Trump, last Thursday, made clear he expects to comment on interest-rate policy and said, \u201cI know interest rates much better than they do.\"",
      "At the same time, Fed officials are also navigating a delicate period for the economy: They want to keep borrowing costs high enough to push inflation back to their 2% target, without keeping them too high for too long and plunging the economy into a recession.",
      "The last time he was in the White House, Trump threatened to fire Powell, whom he appointed in late 2017, but he has more recently backed off such threats. Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026, when Trump can name a replacement.",
      "Until then, Trump's comments Thursday suggest he expects to regularly second-guess the Fed in public, despite a decades-long tradition among previous presidents of taking a hands-off approach to the central bank. Former president Joe Biden reappointed Powell, rather than replacing him, in a nod to central bank independence from politics.",
      "Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Investments and a former top economist at the Fed, said Powell won't let Trump's attacks affect his policy decisions.",
      "\u201cIf you like your independence, then you got to live with criticism,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cIf it\u2019s all talk, it\u2019s not a particular concern to the Fed. I think Chair Powell understands that\u2019s the rules of the game.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Fed officials have clearly signaled they expect to skip a rate hike, at least in January, to evaluate the job market and economy.",
      "\u201cIn January, we kind of need to see what\u2019s going to happen,\" Fed governor Christopher Waller said earlier this month in an interview on CNBC. Fed officials \u201cneed to see a little more progress on inflation,\u201d he added, though he also said it is getting \u201cvery close\u201d to their target.",
      "Annual inflation was just 2.4% in November, according to the Fed's preferred gauge, only modestly above its goal, but it has been stuck there for about six months. Still, there are signs that prices should cool later this year. A spurt of apartment construction is bringing down the growth in rental costs, and car insurance inflation has also slowed.",
      "Some officials, including Beth Hammack, president of the Fed\u2019s Cleveland branch, have argued that the persistence of inflation means the Fed should keep its key rate elevated. Hammack voted against the Fed\u2019s quarter-point cut last month.",
      "Hiring rebounded in December, reversing a downshift in the fall that had unnerved the Fed. Policymakers had agreed to cut the Fed's key rate by a half-point in September, partly because they worried that a then-weakening job market could lead to a recession. Yet the jobless rate ticked down to a low 4.1% last month. A sharp slowdown in hiring would likely spur the Fed to cut rates more quickly.",
      "Fed officials in December signaled that they expected to reduce rates just twice this year. But the 19-member committee that makes interest rate decisions is clearly divided. Some officials, such as Waller and Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, expect inflation to keep cooling and argue that the Fed's rate doesn't need to be so high.",
      "Others, such as Hammack and Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Kansas City branch, say that with inflation still above target and the economy healthy, there is no need to reduce borrowing costs, or at least not by much.",
      "A big unknown for the Fed this year is whether Trump will impose tariffs, how sweeping they will be, and whether they will push up prices. Mass deportation of immigrants could also force employers to pay more for workers to fill jobs, which could also lift inflation.",
      "Most economists forecast that widepread tariffs will likely lift inflation by roughly several-tenths of a percentage point \u2014 not a large amount, but potentially enough for the Fed to postpone rate cuts. It could take months for the tariffs to be formally imposed and then to evaluate their impact on the economy. Some economists don't think the impact will be apparent until next year.",
      "Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and a potential candidate to replace Powell, argued in a recent column in the Wall Street Journal that Trump's promises to reduce regulation could push in the other direction, by reducing costs for businesses, and bring down inflation."

      "The Japanese network Fuji Television and its parent company say its president and chairperson are resigning immediately to take responsibility for a widening sex assault scandal linked to one of Japan\u2019s top TV celebrities",
      "TOKYO -- The Japanese network Fuji Television and its parent company said Monday that its president and chairperson were resigning immediately to take responsibility for a widening sex assault scandal linked to one of Japan's top TV celebrities.",
      "The scandal centers on Masahiro Nakai, a former leader of Japan\u2019s once-hugely popular boy band SMAP, and his costly settlement with a woman over the alleged sex assault at a 2023 dinner party that Fuji TV staff allegedly helped to organize.",
      "The allegations surfaced in magazine articles in December and have since triggered claims of systematic cover-ups by Fuji TV executives. The public outrage over the lack of transparency and explanation at the network's earlier news conference this month have led to an avalanche of advertising losses at Fuji, one of the networks where Nakai worked.",
      "Fuji Television Network President Koichi Minato said his company mishandled the case.",
      "\u201cWe are very sorry that we mishandled the case because of our lack of awareness about human rights and corporate governance ... and as a result our responses to the involved woman were inadequate,\u201d Minato said. \u201cWe are very sorry to have destroyed our credibility.\u201d",
      "Minato said the case violated the woman's human rights, without providing details on grounds of privacy. He said it was handled as an \u201cextraordinary\u201d case requiring maximum confidentiality and sensitivity for the woman's mental health and was shared by a small group of officials. The company had continued allowing Nakai to appear on Fuji shows for a year and six months, he said, but denied covering up the case because it involved a big star.",
      "Minato said he did not think what happened was sexual assault and that the case was not reported to the company\u2019s compliance office until the magazine report came out",
      "He also denied a Fuji TV employee\u2019s involvement but said allegations that the employee had previously organized barbecue and other parties for Nakai needed to be investigated.",
      "Fuji officials also acknowledged that female announcers and other female employees have in the past participated at parties for stars, talent agency executives and sponsors, though they denied any sexual services. Minato said he believed top officials were complacent about the outdated gender roles and they now need to \u201cupdate their mindset.\u201d",
      "Nakai last Thursday announced his retirement from the show business, which has already been hit by a series of sexual assault allegations in recent years in what is seen as a delayed #MeToo movement that began in Western nations in the 2010s. He said he was taking responsibility for the \u201ctrouble\u201d and massive business losses as a result. He had earlier denied any violence or involvement of a third party.",
      "Minato said he last saw the victim last summer when she visited his office to tell him she was quitting.",
      "Shukan Bunshun weekly, one of the magazines that exposed the scandal, also alleged that Fuji TV has long exploited its female announcers to entertain stars like Nakai.",
      "The chair of the companies, Shuji Kanoh, was also resigning in a decision made at a board meeting prior to the news conference, officials said.",
      "Japan\u2019s entertainment industry is in the midst of a wave of sexual assault cases, including the abuses of hundreds of boys and young men by late talent mogul Johnny Kitagawa, whose now-defunct agency Johnny & Associates managed many boy bands, including the one to which Nakai belonged, SMAP.",
      "Following massive protests and criticism from even their own employees, Fuji TV and its parent company announced after a board meeting last week that they have set up an independent panel of lawyers to be submitted by March."

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Skyscraper-studded Dubai has been on a hot streak for the last five years \u2014 and some residents are starting to feel burned.",
      "The city-state has seen record-breaking real estate transactions and as more and more people come to live there, and its state-owned airline Emirates is booking record earnings. But all that growth comes with strains for the city's population.",
      "Traffic feels worse than ever on Dubai's roads. The price of housing continues to spike even with new real estate projects being announced almost daily. Caught in the middle are both its Emirati citizens and the vast population of foreigners who power its economy \u2014 sparking rare public expressions of concern.",
      "\u201cDubai is on steroids but affordability risks are increasing,\u201d warned Hasnain Malik in a starkly titled report he wrote for the global data firm Tellimer, where he's a managing director.",
      "Under Dubai's current plans, the city aims to have 5.8 million residents by 2040, adding more than half its current estimated population in just 15 years. Since 1980, its population has already soared from around 255,000 to around 3.8 million.",
      "Real estate lit the fire in Dubai's growth in 2002, when the desert sheikdom began allowing foreigners to own property. After sharp falls during both the 2008-2009 financial crisis and Dubai's brief coronavirus lockdown, prices have been soaring.",
      "Today, average prices per square foot are at all-time highs, according to Property Monitor. Rental prices increased as much as 20% in key neighborhoods last year, with further rises likely this year, with some residents moving to communities further out in the desert, the real estate firm Engel & V\u00f6lkers said.",
      "Even before the boom, some people who worked in Dubai chose to live in the neighboring emirate of Sharjah, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the city's downtown, or further away. Some 1 million commuters from other emirates jam the 12-lane Sheikh Zayed Road that runs through the center of the city and other highways every day, as studies suggest that as many as four out of five employees drive to work alone.",
      "That traffic has only intensified with Dubai's new arrivals.",
      "While the rest of the world saw as much as a 4% increase in the number of registered vehicles in the last two years, the city's Road and Transportation Authority says there's been a 10% increase in the number of vehicles.",
      "So many vehicles have been registered that the city has had to make license plates longer.",
      "And while the city keeps building new flyovers and other road improvements, more cars are coming from more directions than ever before.",
      "\u201cDubai is very attractive, more and more people are coming,\u201d said Thomas Edelmann, the founder and managing director of RoadSafetyUAE, which advocates about traffic issues. \u201cI think it\u2019s easier to get people quickly to come to Dubai and to convince them about Dubai, then to build a new intersection or a new highway.\u201d",
      "Congestion has got so bad that it's driving even prominent Emiratis to break their customary silence on public affairs.",
      "Habib Al Mulla, a prominent Emirati lawyer, wrote on the social platform X in December that while authorities were working on congestion, the problem demanded \u201ca set of immediate and long-term mechanisms.\u201d He followed up by publishing an opinion piece twice mentioning \u201ccongestion\u201d as being among \u201cpressing issues\" for global cities like Dubai.",
      "While phrased in mild language, Al Mulla\u2019s comments represented rare public criticism in the United Arab Emirates, where speech is tightly controlled by criminal law and social norms favor raising issues at a \u201cmajlis\u201d \u2014 a semiprivate setting convened by a traditional ruler.",
      "\u201cThe concentration of wealth and opportunities created in global cities may cause income inequality that pushes out lower-income residents,\u201d Al Mulla warned in the English-language Khaleej Times newspaper on Jan. 15.",
      "\u201cThe problem becomes acute when the wealth and opportunities remain inaccessible to segments of the national population who witness the city\u2019s allure being seized by outsiders. This may carry significant social risks, if not mitigated.\u201d",
      "Then there's demographic concerns as the Emirati share of the population dwindles. While the number of citizens isn't public, a back-of-the-envelope, informal calculation shared for years by experts suggests Emirati citizens represent around 10% of the country's overall population of more than 9 million people, a number that's likely falling as foreigners rush in.",
      "In December, sermon scripts issued for the Dec. 13 Friday's prayers directly touched on the duty of having more children.",

      "For Dubai's autocratic government, overseen by ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, possible solutions to the grinding traffic have ranged from the practical to the fanciful. The government in recent months has repeatedly encouraged companies to allow more remote work options, including in a report released in November that also suggested staggered and flexible working hours.",
      "Adding as many as five remote workdays a month, along with the other steps, \u201ccan reduce morning peak travel time across Dubai by 30%,\u201d the study stated.",
      "Dubai's road toll system, known as Salik, has added gates to charge drivers more and will institute surge pricing at the end of the month. Dubai's Metro, which boasts the world's longest self-driving rail line, will also grow beyond its broadly north-south routes in a nearly $5 billion expansion.",
      "Then there's the flying taxi project. Since 2017, Dubai has been announcing plans for airborne cabs in the city. A first \u201cvertiport\u201d is being built by Dubai International Airport with the aim of offering the service from next year.",
      "Dubai also plans 3,300 kilometers (2,050 miles) of new pedestrian paths, although during Dubai's summer months pedestrians have to contend with high humidity and heat of around 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cIn the coming years, residents of Dubai will be able to move around by walking, cycling, its extensive network of roads and bridges, the Metro and its new lines, water taxis, or flying taxis on specific air routes,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed said on X in December.",

    "summary": "Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok&rsquo;s parent company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok&rsquo;s U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter",
    "story": [
      "Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok\u2019s parent company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok\u2019s U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter",
      "WASHINGTON -- Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok\u2019s parent company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok\u2019s U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "The proposal, submitted last week, is a revision of a prior plan the artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went into effect.",
      "The first proposal, which ByteDance hasn't responded to, sought to create a new structure that would merge San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok\u2019s U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
      "The new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity\u2019s proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.",
      "If the plan is successful, the shares owned by the government would not have voting power, the person said. The government also would not get a seat on the new company\u2019s board.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately responded to a request for comment.",
      "Under the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a \u201cfull U.S. board control,\u201d the person said.",
      "Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok\u2019s U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press. In exchange, ByteDance's existing investors will get equity in the new structure that emerges.",
      "The proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during Trump\u2019s first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News\u2019 Sunday Morning Futures \u2014 that a new investor in TikTok could simply \u201cdilute down\u201d the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.",
      "\u201cBut the technology needs to be disconnected from China,\u201d he added. \u201cIt needs to be disconnected from ByteDance. There\u2019s absolutely no way that China would ever let us have something like that in China.\u201d",
      "The Perplexity proposal comes as several investors are expressing interest in TikTok. President Donald Trump said late Saturday that he expects a deal will be made in as soon as 30 days.",
      "On a flight from Las Vegas to Miami on Air Force One, Trump also said he hadn't discussed a deal with Larry Ellison, CEO of software maker Oracle, despite a report that Oracle, along with outside investors, was considering taking over TikTok's global operation.",
      "\u201cNumerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary. ... I\u2019d only do it if the United States benefits.\u201d",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.",
      "Trump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \u201cright down the road\u201d from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \u201cI never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I\u2019ve spoken to many people about TikTok and there\u2019s great interest in TikTok.\u201d",
      "TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Trump said he would postpone the ban. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year\u2019s presidential election.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, along with some other tech leaders who've been forging friendlier ties with the new administration.",
      "Congress voted to ban TikTok in the U.S. out of concern that TikTok's ownership structure represented a security risk. The Biden administration argued in court for months that it was too much of a risk to allow a Chinese company to control the algorithm that fuels what people see on the app. Officials also raised concerns about user data collected on the platform.",
      "However, to date, the U.S. hasn't provided public evidence of TikTok handing user data to Chinese authorities or allowing them to tinker with its algorithm.",

      "The White House is claiming victory in a showdown with Colombia over accepting flights of deported migrants from the U.S., hours after President Donald Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports and other sanctions on the longtime U.S. partner",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The White House claimed victory in a showdown with Colombia over accepting flights of deported migrants from the U.S. on Sunday, hours after President Donald Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports and other sanctions on the longtime U.S. partner.",
      "Long close partners in anti-narcotics efforts, the U.S. and Colombia clashed Sunday over the deportation of migrants and imposed tariffs on each other\u2019s goods in a show of what other countries could face if they intervene in the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration. The White House held up the episode as a warning to other nations who might seek to impede his plans.",
      "Earlier, the U.S. president had ordered visa restrictions, 25% tariffs on all Colombian incoming goods, which would be raised to 50% in one week, and other retaliatory measures sparked by President Gustavo Petro's decision to reject two Colombia-bound U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants after Petro accused Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation. Petro also announced a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "Trump said the measures were necessary because Petro\u2019s decision \u201cjeopardized\u201d national security in the U.S. by blocking the deportation flights.",
      "\u201cThese measures are just the beginning,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \u201cWe will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States.\u201d",
      "Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a late Sunday statement that the \u201cGovernment of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump\u2019s terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay.\u201d",
      "Leavitt said the tariff orders will be \u201cheld in reserve, and not signed.\" But Leavitt said Trump would maintain visa restrictions on Colombian officials and enhanced customs inspections of goods from the country, \u201cuntil the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned.\u201d",
      "The Colombian government late Sunday said it considered as \u201covercome\u201d the episode with the Trump administration and Petro reposted the statement from the White House on X.",
      "\u201cWe have overcome the impasse with the United States government,\u201d said Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo. \u201cWe will continue to receive Colombians who return as deportees, guaranteeing them decent conditions as citizens subject to rights.\u201d",
      "Murillo added that the South American country\u2019s presidential aircraft is available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes.",
      "Earlier Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he was authorizing the visa restrictions on Colombian government officials and their families \u201cwho were responsible for the interference of U.S. repatriation flight operations.\" They were being imposed on top of the State Department's move to suspend the processing of visas at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia\u2019s capital, Bogota.",
      "Petro had said earlier that his government would not accept flights carrying migrants deported from the U.S. until the Trump administration creates a protocol that treats them with \u201cdignity.\u201d Petro made the announcement in two X posts, one of which included a news video of migrants reportedly deported to Brazil walking on a tarmac with restraints on their hands and feet.",
      "\u201cA migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,\u201d Petro said. \u201cThat is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants... In civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive our fellow citizens.\"",
      "After Trump's earlier tariff threat, Petro said in a post on X that he had ordered the \u201cforeign trade minister to raise import tariffs from the U.S. by 25%.\u201d",
      "Colombia has traditionally been the U.S.\u2019s top ally in Latin America. But their relationship has strained since Petro, a former guerrilla, became Colombia\u2019s first leftist president in 2022 and sought distance from the U.S.",
      "Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the U.S. from 2020 to 2024, fifth behind Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data. It accepted 124 deportation flights in 2024.",
      "Colombia is also among the countries that last year began accepting U.S.-funded deportation flights from Panama.",
      "The U.S. government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press regarding aircraft and protocols used in deportations to Colombia.",
      "\u201cThis is a clear message we are sending that countries have an obligation to accept repatriation flights,\" a senior administration official told AP. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss issue publicly.",
      "Rubio in a statement said Petro \u201ccanceled his authorization\u201d for the flights when the aircraft were in the air.",
      "Colombians emerged in recent years as a major presence on the U.S. border with Mexico, aided in part by a visa regime that allows them to easily fly to Mexico and avoid trekking though the treacherous Darien Gap. They ranked fourth with 127,604 arrests for illegal crossings during a 12-month period through September, behind Mexicans, Guatemalans and Venezuelans.",
      "Mexico hasn't imposed visa restrictions on Colombians, as they have on Venezuelans, Ecuadoreans and Peruvians.",
      "Petro's government in a statement later announced that the South American country's presidential aircraft had been made available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes and guarantee them \u201cdignified conditions.\"",
      "As part of a flurry of actions to make good on Trump's campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration, his government is using active-duty military to help secure the border and carry out deportations.",
      "Two U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo planes carrying migrants removed from the U.S. touched down early Friday in Guatemala. That same day, Honduras received two deportation flights carrying a total of 193 people.",
      "Colombia is the U.S.\u2019s fourth-largest overseas supplier of crude oil, shipping about 209,000 barrels of oil per day last year, although booming domestic production has reduced the U.S.\u2019 dependence on foreign oil. The South American country is also the U.S.\u2019s largest supplier of fresh cut flowers.",

      "Workers at a factory in rural Ohio were up all night churning out footballs for this year\u2019s Super Bowl",
      "As soon as this year's Super Bowl matchup was set, workers at the Wilson Sporting Goods football factory jumped into action.",
      "The factory in the rural village of Ada, Ohio, makes the game balls used by every NFL team along with many of the nation\u2019s top college programs and high schools.",
      "But this time of year it's all about the Super Bowl. The Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will face off for the Lombardi Trophy for the second time in three years on Feb. 9 in New Orleans.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the footballs, by the numbers:",
      "The two teams will each get a shipment of 108, plus a dozen more for the kickers, all stamped with the Super Bowl logo and team names. Some of the balls will be for practices, while the best ones will be set aside by the quarterbacks. About 50 of those will be bagged and locked away for each team until it's time for kickoff.",
      "Wilson makes five different sizes for players of all levels, from the pros to youth leagues. Some have different patterns. NFL balls are notable for the lack of a stripe on the ends. They're also embedded with a chip that tracks the ball's position on the field, how far it travels and its trajectory.",
      "Normally it takes three days from start to finish. But the first batch of footballs must be sent to the Super Bowl teams Monday, within about 18 hours, so they have enough time to break them in for practices and the game. That's why the workers start production right away the night of the conference title games.",
      "It's a 20-step process, most of it by hand, from cutting out the four leather panels that are sewn together with 250 stitches to putting in the laces. For NFL footballs, the work goes to the factory's most experienced and skilled workers. \u201cCertain parts of the process require a handmade feel,\u201d said Kevin Murphy, general manager of Wilson Team Sports. \u201cIt's like making a beautiful, sculpted pair of shoes.\u201d",
      "Throughout production the balls are weighed, measured and inspected for flaws. Once finished, they're checked again. By the time they're packaged and ready for shipping, each one will have been touched by about 50 workers.",
      "It churns out roughly 500,000 footballs each year, or about 2,500 per day. NFL teams go through several hundred during a season. For the Super Bowl, Wilson will make between 10,000-20,000 commemorative balls that will be sold by retailers nationwide and at the game site. If there's high demand, the factory will keep producing the souvenir balls well after.",
      "Since 1941, Wilson has made every football used by the league. Its factory in Ada has been making the official game balls since 1955. This year the company opened a new plant in the village that allows for more production and a museum. Fans can tour the factory, too."

      "Five years after NBA great Kobe Bryant, 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash in California, several women\u2019s basketball players reflected on what he meant to their game and how he championed it",
      "Dearica Hamby still smiles at the memory of Kobe Bryant sitting courtside at WNBA games.",
      "She had met him years ago. He came to see her old team, the Las Vegas Aces, play all the time.",
      "\u201cI think one of the first things he told me was that I could play defense,\" Hamby recalled. \"And I was kind of like \u2018Wha-at?\u2019 ... That's something I'll cherish with me forever.\u201d",
      "That epitomized the late NBA great's relationship with the women's game. After his 20-year playing career ended, Bryant turned his focus to the next generation, mentoring some of women's basketball's biggest stars, from WNBA champion and Olympic gold medalist Diana Taurasi to former Oregon star Sabrina Ionescu.",
      "He worked out with them, analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of their game and pushed for them to reach the same heights in popularity that he and his NBA peers did.",
      "For Hamby, now with the Los Angeles Sparks, Bryant saw an aspect of her game she didn't even know she had.",
      "\u201cIf Kobe tells you you can play defense, you can play defense,\" she quipped.",
      "Five years after Bryant, 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, several women's basketball players reflected on what he meant to their game and how he championed it. Many of them thought Bryant would be pleased with the overall progress of women's sports, which have skyrocketed in popularity and reach in recent years.",
      "That growth has been most prominent in the women's basketball arenas that Bryant and Gianna loved so much.",
      "The WNBA last season had its most-watched regular season in 24 years and its best attendance in 22 seasons. Some of the league's most popular players currently are competing in a new 3-on-3 league in South Florida called Unrivaled, founded by Olympic gold medalists Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart.",
      "\u201cWe carry this on for him,\u201d said Satou Sabally, a forward with the WNBA's Dallas Wings who plays for the Phantom squad in Unrivaled. \u201cHe would be so proud of this league. He would be proud of \u2019Phe and Stewie. I know that he\u2019s looking down and hopefully he\u2019s smiling and is proud of us.\u201d",
      "Sabally said she still gets emotional when she thinks of that day on Jan. 26, 2020. It reminds her of her playing days at Oregon, when she, Ionescu and their Ducks teammates connected over Bryant.",
      "\u201cI think about ... how we all bonded together over Kobe and how we bonded together for the rest of our lives because he was so impactful,\u201d Sabally added. \u201cHe was really a person that saw us women as the talents who we are. He came to the games, he was so outspoken and he really was really supportive.\"",
      "The shock of the superstar's death echoed throughout the sports and entertainment worlds, with many taking to social media to post emotional tributes to Bryant while expressing their disbelief.",
      "People were glued to their phones and TV screens as news of the crash spread. NBA players were in tears ahead of games that day.",
      "\u201cI still remember exactly where I was whenever we heard the news,\" said Kate Martin of the Golden State Valkyries, playing for Laces BC at Unrivaled, \"and no one really knew if it was fake or real. I think that\u2019s just one of those things where you\u2019re just always going to remember exactly where you were when you heard that.\u201d",
      "Martin never met Bryant but said she cherishes his mentality \u2014 he had a relentless competitiveness \u2014 and the way he elevated women's sports.",
      "Bryant became heavily involved with his daughters' hoops journeys and coached Gianna's youth team. He was often at women's basketball games, especially college ones, with Gianna, who was fascinated with the UConn Huskies. Gianna was in line to further Bryant's legacy on the court. The plan was for her to attend Connecticut, and surely the WNBA was next.",
      "Bryant was passionate about women's sports despite the belief of some that he should not have been involved with the women\u2019s game at all because of a 2003 charge accusing him of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old employee at a Colorado resort.",
      "Bryant had said the two had consensual sex, and the charge was eventually dropped when the woman declined to testify at trial. The woman later filed a civil suit against Bryant that was settled out of court.",
      "There's an image that still circulates in the sports world today: Kobe and Gianna sitting courtside at a 2019 game featuring his Los Angeles Lakers. He wore a bright orange pullover with a white WNBA logo on the front. Gianna sat beaming at his side.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people started to follow behind Kobe because he recognized our gift and our talent and how special it really is,\" said former Chicago Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon, the current coach of Unrivaled's Vinyl BC. \"And his daughter was right there as well.\u201d",
      "That's who Bryant had become \u2014 a face of women's sports advocacy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s greatly missed,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut now his legacy will live on forever.\u201d",

      "Alexander Zverev says he is feeling down and emotional after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Alexander Zverev described himself as \u201cquite down\u201d and \u201cquite emotional\" after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title.",
      "And unlike his first two defeats in major finals \u2014 both of which he led, and both of which went five sets \u2014 Zverev did not come close to reaching the finish line Sunday in the Australian Open final, which ended with defending champion Jannik Sinner holding the trophy after his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can. I\u2019m working as hard as I ever did. I think I\u2019m doing all the right things off-court. I think I\u2019m practicing the right things. But I lost in straight sets today. I mean, those are facts. That is a fact. I lost to Jannik in straight sets today,\u201d said Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany who is ranked No. 2 but did not seem anywhere near No. 1 Sinner on this occasion.",
      "\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want to end my career as the best player of all time to never win a Grand Slam, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Zverev, whose post-match speech was interrupted by someone in Rod Laver Arena calling out the names of two women who have accused him of physical abuse in the past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll keep doing everything I can,\" Zverev said, \"to lift one of those trophies.\u201d",
      "He is the seventh man in the Open era, which dates to 1968, to start a career with an 0-3 record in title matches at one of the sport's four most important events.",
      "Five of the other six went on to win at least one major championship. The only member of the group who hasn't is Casper Ruud, who is also the only one still active.",
      "Sinner offered support to Zverev during the trophy ceremony Sunday. That came in the form of an arm around the shoulder \u2014 and with his words.",
      "\u201cKeep believing in yourself,\u201d Sinner told Zverev. \u201cKeep working hard, because we all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.\u201d",
      "Simone Vagnozzi, one of Sinner\u2019s coaches, said about Zverev: \u201cI really hope, sooner or later, he wins a Slam, because he deserves it.\u201d",
      "Zverev's previous trips to the brink of achieving what he very badly wants came at the 2020 U.S. Open, where he built a two-set lead and even held a match point against Dominic Thiem before faltering, and at the 2024 French Open, where he led Carlos Alcaraz two sets to one before letting that slip away.",
      "This one never got to that sort of stage, and Zverev frequently showed his frustration by cracking rackets",
      "The nearest Zverev came to really making it close was when he was two points from taking the second set. But Sinner took the next four points and that, basically, was that.",
      "\u201cThat was a massive point. I think whoever wins that set, kind of can get a little bit of momentum. Being down two sets to love, especially, then his confidence goes up, mine goes down. It\u2019s a long way back then against someone like Jannik,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cIf it\u2019s one set all, maybe I have a chance. But ... I didn\u2019t stop fighting. I didn\u2019t stop believing. Then, in the third set, I thought he outplayed me more than in the other sets.\u201d",

      "The start of Sunday's race was delayed for 15 minutes as organizers needed more time to prepare the course after overnight snowfall and rain in the hours leading up to the race.",
      "Ariane Raedler had a nasty tumble when she came off the course and lost balance over a patch of softer snow, but the Austrian got up quickly and appeared to have avoided injury.",

      "BANGKOK -- The 40-year-old founder of China\u2019s DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund and then refined its quantitative models to branch into artificial intelligence.",

      "\u201cCurrently, neither tech giants nor startups have an unassailable lead. With OpenAI paving the way, everyone is working with published papers and open-source code,\u201d it quoted him as saying.",
      "Liang said he spends his days reading papers, writing code, and participating in group discussions, like other researchers.",
      "DeepSeek is exploring what intelligence means, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople may think there\u2019s some hidden business logic behind this, but it\u2019s mainly driven by curiosity,\u201d Liang said.",
      "When DeepSeek was asked, \u201cWho is Liang Wenfeng?\u201d its first answer was to name a different Chinese entrepreneur with the same name, at least as spelled in English letters.",
      "When asked: \u201cWhere is Liang Wenfeng from and where did he go to university?\u201d it said that as of October 2023, the most recent knowledge cutoff for DeepSeek's R1 AI model, \u201cthere is no publicly available information about Liang Wenfeng\u2019s background, including his place of origin or educational history.\"",
      "\"If you are referring to the founder of DeepSeek, details about his personal life or academic background have not been disclosed publicly. For more information about DeepSeek, you can visit its official website,\u201d it said.",
      "Liang's focused approach fits in with his determination to push AI learning forward. After decades of relying on innovation from the West, he says China should be making its own contributions.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that Chinese AI can\u2019t be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between Chinese AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation,\u201d he said in another Waves interview in November. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t change, China will always be only a follower \u2014 so some exploration is inescapable.\u201d",

    "summary": "NATO is deploying eyes in the sky and on the Baltic Sea to protect cables and pipelines that stitch together the nine countries with shores on Baltic waters",
    "story": [
      "NATO is deploying eyes in the sky and on the Baltic Sea to protect cables and pipelines that stitch together the nine countries with shores on Baltic waters",
      "ABOARD A FRENCH NAVY FLIGHT OVER THE BALTIC SEA -- With its powerful camera, the French Navy surveillance plane scouring the Baltic Sea zoomed in on a cargo ship plowing the waters below \u2014 closer, closer and closer still until the camera operator could make out details on the vessel's front deck and smoke pouring from its chimney.",
      "The long-range Atlantique 2 aircraft on a new mission for NATO then shifted its high-tech gaze onto another target, and another after that until, after more than five hours on patrol, the plane's array of sensors had scoped out the bulk of the Baltic \u2014 from Germany in the west to Estonia in the northeast, bordering Russia.",
      "The flight's mere presence in the skies above the strategic sea last week, combined with military ships patrolling on the waters, also sent an unmistakable message: The NATO alliance is ratcheting up its guard against suspected attempts to sabotage underwater energy and data cables and pipelines that crisscross the Baltic, prompted by a growing catalogue of incidents that have damaged them.",
      "\u201cWe will do everything in our power to make sure that we fight back, that we are able to see what is happening and then take the next steps to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. And our adversaries should know this,\" NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said this month in announcing a new alliance mission, dubbed \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d to protect the underwater infrastructure vital to the economic well-being of Baltic-region nations.",
      "Power and communications cables and gas pipelines stitch together the nine countries with shores on the Baltic, a relatively shallow and nearly landlocked sea. A few examples are the 152-kilometer (94-mile) Balticconnector pipeline that carries gas between Finland and Estonia, the high-voltage Baltic Cable connecting the power grids of Sweden and Germany, and the 1,173-kilometer (729-mile) C-Lion1 telecommunications cable between Finland and Germany.",
      "Undersea pipes and cables help power economies, keep houses warm and connect billions of people. More than 1.3 million kilometers (807,800 miles) of fiber optic cables \u2014 more than enough to stretch to the moon and back \u2014 span the world's oceans and seas, according to TeleGeography, which tracks and maps the vital communication networks. The cables are typically the width of a garden hose. But 97% of the world\u2019s communications, including trillions of dollars of financial transactions, pass through them each day.",
      "\u201cIn the last two months alone, we have seen damage to a cable connecting Lithuania and Sweden, another connecting Germany and Finland, and most recently, a number of cables linking Estonia and Finland. Investigations of all of these cases are still ongoing. But there is reason for grave concern,\" Rutte said on Jan. 14.",
      "At least 11 Baltic cables have been damaged since October 2023 \u2014 the most recent being a fiber optic cable connecting Latvia and the Swedish island of Gotland, reported to have ruptured on Sunday. Although cable operators note that subsea cable damage is commonplace, the frequency and concentration of incidents in the Baltic heightened suspicions that damage might have been deliberate.",
      "There also are fears that Russia could target cables as part of a wider campaign of so-called \u201chybrid warfare\u201d to destabilize European nations helping Ukraine defend itself against the full-scale invasion that Moscow has been pursuing since 2022.",
      "Without specifically blaming Russia, Rutte said: \u201cHybrid means sabotage. Hybrid means cyber-attacks. Hybrid means sometimes even assassination attacks, attempts, and in this case, it means hitting on our critical undersea infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Finnish police suspect that the Eagle S, an oil tanker that damaged the Estlink 2 power cable and two other communications cables linking Finland and Estonia on Dec. 25th, is part of Moscow\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d used to avoid war-related sanctions on Russian oil exports.",
      "Finnish authorities seized the tanker shortly after it left a Russian port and apparently cut the cables by dragging its anchor. Finnish investigators allege the ship left an almost 100-kilometer (62-mile) long anchor trail on the seabed.",
      "Several Western intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of their work, told The Associated Press that recent damage was most likely accidental, seemingly caused by anchors being dragged by ships that were poorly maintained and poorly crewed.",
      "One senior intelligence official told AP that ships' logs and mechanical failures with ships' anchors were among \u201cmultiple indications\u201d pointing away from Russian sabotage. The official said Russian cables were also severed. Another Western official, also speaking anonymously to discuss intelligence matters, said Russia sent an intelligence-gathering vessel to the site of one cable rupture to investigate the damage.",
      "The Washington Post first reported on the emerging consensus among U.S. and European security services that maritime accidents likely caused recent damage.",
      "The European Subsea Cables Association, representing cable owners and operators, noted in November after faults were reported on two Baltic links that, on average, a subsea cable is damaged somewhere in the world every three days. In northern European waters, the main causes of damage are commercial fishing or ship anchors, it said.",
      "In the fiber-optic cable rupture on Sunday connecting Latvia and Sweden, Swedish authorities detained a Maltese-flagged ship bound for South America with a cargo of fertilizer.",
      "Navibulgar, a Bulgarian company that owns the Vezhen, said any damage was unintentional and that the ship's crew discovered while navigating in extremely bad weather that its left anchor appeared to have dragged on the seabed.",
      "The alliance is deploying warships, maritime patrol aircraft and naval drones for the mission to provide \u201cenhanced surveillance and deterrence.\u201d",
      "Aboard the French Navy surveillance flight, the 14-member crew cross-checked ships they spotted from the air against lists of vessels they had been ordered to watch for.",
      "\u201cIf we witness some suspicious activities from ships as sea \u2013 for example, ships at very low speed or at anchorage in a position that they shouldn\u2019t be at this time \u2013 so this is something we can see,\u201d said the flight commander, Lt. Alban, whose surname was withheld by the French military for security reasons.",
      "\u201cWe can have a very close look with our sensors to see what is happening.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump said Monday evening that Microsoft is among the U.S. companies looking to take control of TikTok to help the popular app avert an effective ban that could kick-in in April.",
      "\u201cI would say yes,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked if Microsoft was one of the companies interested in helping to bring about a new ownership of TikTok, a requirement set by Congress to keep the app functioning in the U.S.",
      "Trump added that other companies were also interested in purchasing TikTok, but wouldn\u2019t provide a list.",
      "\u201cI like bidding wars because you make your best deals,\u201d Trump said as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One while flying back to Washington from Miami, where Republican House members were holding a conference.",
      "Microsoft declined to comment. Representatives for TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In one of his first acts in office last week, Trump extended the deadline for TikTok to find new ownership that satisfies the government by 75 days, to April 4 from January 19.",
      "The president has said that he\u2019s looking for the ultimate purchaser to give the U.S. a 50% stake in the company, which is owned by China-based ByteDance. But the details remain murky, and its unclear whether he's proposing control of the app by the government or another U.S. entity.",
      "Last week, the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI presented a new proposal to ByteDance that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok\u2019s U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Several other investors \u2014 including billionaire Frank McCourt and Trump's former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2014 have spoken publicly about their desire to purchase TikTok's U.S. platform. Trump has also said he\u2019s spoken to \u201cmany people\u201d privately about the company.",
      "After the bipartisan law was signed by former President Joe Biden in April, ByteDance said it did not have plans to sell the platform and fought the statute in court for months. China also rebuked Washington over the divestment push, though more recently it appears to be softening its stance.",
      "In media interviews last week, Bill Ford, the chairman of the global investing firm General Atlantic and a ByteDance board member, said the company is prepared to engage with the Trump administration and Chinese officials to find a solution that keeps TikTok available. He also floated the idea that there could be a solution short of a full divesture by ByteDance.",
      "Lawmakers and officials in both parties have raised national security concerns about Chinese ownership and potential manipulation on the immensely popular platform, which is used by more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Trump was in favor of a TikTok ban before he reversed his position last year. He credits the platform with helping him win more young voters during the recent presidential election.",
      "Microsoft, along with Walmart, made a failed bid for TikTok during Trump\u2019s first term after Trump tried to ban the app. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later described it as the \u201cstrangest thing I\u2019ve ever worked on.\u201d"

      "Workers at a Whole Foods Market in Pennsylvania voted to unionize on Monday, becoming the first group of employees to pull off a labor win at the Amazon-owned grocery store chain.",
      "Employees at the Philadelphia store cast 130 votes \u2014 or about 57% of the ballots cast \u2014 in favor of joining a local chapter of The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union for the purposes of collective bargaining. According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",
      "\u201cThis fight is far from over, but today\u2019s victory is an important step forward,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of UFCW Local 1776. \"We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers\u2019 needs and priorities.\u201d",
      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon\u2019s grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",
      "In a statement after the votes were counted Monday night, Whole Foods said it \u201cis proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed by the outcome of this election, but we are committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store,\u201d the company added.",
      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \u201con-demand\u201d mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid. Whole Foods disputed the worker was fired in retaliation.",
      "The union has also accused Whole Foods of withholding region-wide wage increases from employees at the Philadelphia store because of the union activities.",
      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",
      "The company said it was delaying the pay bumps until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the vote with raises.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon has resisted union organizing efforts by its workers. Amazon delivery drivers went on strike in a handful of U.S. cities before Christmas to exert pressure on the the company to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are scheduled to vote next month on whether they want to be represented by an upstart union called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment.",
      "The retail giant has challenged the structure of the National Labor Relations Board in court. Amazon accused the federal agency of tampering in the 2022 union election at the Staten Island warehouse, in part by bringing a lawsuit against the company to reinstate a fired organizer close to when voting began.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said vaccines are not safe. His support for abortion access has made conservatives uncomfortable. And farmers across the Midwest are nervous over his talk of banning corn syrup and pesticides from America's food supply.",
      "The 71-year-old, whose famous name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has spent years airing his populist \u2014 and sometimes extreme \u2014 views in podcasts, TV interviews and speeches building his own quixotic brand.",
      "A son of a Democratic political dynasty, Kennedy is seeking to become the nation's top health official under President Donald Trump. To get there, he's softening those long-held beliefs, hoping to win approval from the Republican Party.",
      "At stake is Kennedy's control of the nation's sprawling $1.7 trillion U.S. Health and Human Services agency, which oversees food and hospital inspections, health insurance for roughly half of the country and vaccine recommendations. The job would finally give him the kind of political power Kennedys have wielded for decades.",
      "He made a long-shot bid for the presidency last year, following uncles John, who won the White House in 1960, and Edward, who lost his bid in 1980, along with his father, Robert, a leading contender who was assassinated after winning the California primary in 1968.",
      "With a strong resemblance to his father and lawyer credentials to match, he found ardent followers who embrace the critiques he's lodged against unhealthy foods, pharmaceutical companies and chemicals.",
      "But he couldn't get Democrats on his side, with some of his relatives shunning him over his vaccine views. His has been a flexible ideological journey, part liberal Democrat, part libertarian, and now, an adherent of the MAGA agenda after dropping out of the race last year to back Trump.",
      "The president has since directed him to \u201cgo wild\u201d on health. Together, they've even hatched a new slogan: \"Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "Kennedy's aspirations now rest with the Republican-controlled Senate, where he can lose only three GOP votes if all Democrats oppose him.",
      "As Kennedy's confirmation hearings approach this week, he faces a coordinated effort to stop his nomination. A television and digital ad campaign is highlighting his anti-vaccine work. And former Vice President Mike Pence, a stalwart of the conservative anti-abortion movement, is lobbying against him, too.",
      "Kennedy's closest supporters believe he'll prevail. He plans to focus on issues that have bipartisan consensus, like reducing food additives and increasing access to healthier foods. When concerns about his views on conservative priorities like abortion come up, he's promised to follow Trump's lead.",
      "Then there is Kennedy's biggest advantage \u2014 and maybe, too, his biggest liability for someone working under Trump \u2014 his star power.",
      "\u201cBobby K. is coming in with a bigger microphone than any HHS Secretary,\u201d said Calley Means, a close adviser to Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy's numerous remarks, anti-vaccine nonprofit and lawsuits against immunizations are likely to haunt him.",
      "He's rejected the anti-vaccine label, instead casting himself as a crusader for \u201cmedical freedom\u201d who wants more research. He and Trump have vowed not to \u201ctake away\u201d vaccines. To defuse criticism, he resigned from the Children\u2019s Health Defense, his nonprofit that has filed dozens of lawsuits against vaccines, including the government authorizations of some of them.",
      "But critics have argued that his work advocating against vaccine use has cost lives. Democrats are poised to home in on his social media campaigns and work in Samoa, the island nation in the Pacific Ocean where doctors say he and his anti-vaccine acolytes seized on a tragedy to campaign against childhood inoculations.",
      "In 2018, two Samoan children died from botched vaccinations, prompting the government to suspend the childhood vaccination program.",
      "Kennedy showed up with his wife, actor Cheryl Hines, to meet with the prime minister, health minister and other health officials in 2019. Kennedy says he promoted a \u201cmedical informatics system\u201d that would \"assess the efficacy and safety of every medical intervention or drug on overall health.\u201d",
      "Later that year, a measles epidemic killed dozens of infants and children.",
      "Democrat Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, an emergency room doctor who organized flights loaded with 50,000 vaccine doses, doctors and nurses to administer inoculations, has led the campaign to highlight Kennedy's role. He shared during one-on-one meetings with a handful of senators earlier this month what he witnessed there, including accounts from villagers who told them about Facebook posts that scared them away from vaccinations.",
      "\u201cHe went there and used celebrity status to scare the country away from vaccinating,\" Green said of Kennedy. \"You have to ask yourself, \u2018Why, RFK Jr., would you go to Samoa and do this to innocent people?\u2019\u201d",
      "Kennedy has denied playing any role in the outbreak.",
      "A Democratic group is running digital ads that accuse Kennedy of spreading misinformation in Samoa. The campaign is targeting senators in nine states, including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and John Curtis of Utah, which boasts a significant Samoan population.",
      "Another they're targeting is Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Senate committee, which holds a hearing Thursday. Cassidy, who is also a doctor, stopped short of endorsing Kennedy after they met and is seen as swayable.",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who suffered from polio as a child, may also be in play. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, McConnell dipped into his own campaign funds to urge Kentucky residents to vaccinate against the virus.",
      "Last month, McConnell sent a warning about attempts to discredit the polio vaccine.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "Other conservatives have question Kennedy's abortion views, after he said last year that it should be legal for full-term pregnancies. His campaign later clarified that he supports abortion rights until fetal viability, around 22 to 24 weeks.",
      "In meetings with some senators, he's promised to follow Trump's directive on the issue.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for example, said he was convinced after talking to Kennedy that he would be a strong anti-abortion advocate.",
      "But skepticism remains, with Pence's advocacy group highlighting his abortion views in an ad campaign.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr. has made certain overtures to pro-life leaders that he would be mindful of their concerns at HHS, there is little reason for confidence at this time,\" his group said in a letter sent to senators last week.",
      "In Iowa, Kennedy's nomination both excites and worries corn and soybean farmer Brian Fyre.",
      "The sixth-generation farmer and Republican thinks Kennedy will offer a fresh perspective, but he also can't afford the ban on corn syrup or pesticides that Kennedy has promised. If confirmed, Kennedy would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, which has the power to enact restrictions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d be pinched out. It would devastate rural, Midwest communities,\u201d Fyre said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a food supply for a nation. You can\u2019t upend that without a viable alternative.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said he planned to offer some \u201ceducating\u201d on agriculture to Kennedy.",
      "Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from a dairy farm state, sees it differently, telling a crowd at the Heritage Foundation last month that Kennedy's agriculture ideas are a promising part of a bigger goal: \u201cto Make America Healthy Again.\u201d"

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- After a half-century of public silence, a freelance photographer from Vietnam has asserted he took one of the most renowned and impactful photos of the 20th century \u2014 the image of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack in South Vietnam that has long been credited to a staff photographer from The Associated Press.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Nghe claimed authorship of the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cnapalm girl\u201d photograph in the new documentary \u201cThe Stringer\u201d and on the sidelines of its premiere Saturday night at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.",
      "The AP conducted its own investigation and said it has no reason to conclude that anyone other than the long-credited photographer, Nick Ut, made the picture. The news agency said it was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d that filmmakers portrayed it as having reviewed the film\u2019s materials and being dismissive. The AP said it saw the film for the first time at Sundance.",
      "Nghe joined the filmmakers for the post-screening Q&A where he said, through a translator, \u201cI took the photo.\u201d The audience cheered enthusiastically. He did not say why he waited so long to make the claim.",
      "The AP said it was calling on the filmmakers to release their contributors from non-disclosure agreements for the film, including Nghe. It also called on the filmmakers to share a visual analysis they commissioned \u2014 and the film itself. \u201cWe cannot state more clearly that The Associated Press is only interested in the facts and a truthful history of this iconic photo,\" the agency said.",
      "Nguyen says he took the iconic photo of Kim Phuc on June 8, 1972. Nghe said he went to the town of Trang Bang that day as a driver for an NBC news crew and captured the image of Phuc running down the street, crying and naked with arms outstretched. He said he sold his image to the AP for $20, and they gave him a print of the photo that his wife later destroyed.",
      "Representatives for the AP, who saw the film for the first time Saturday at the premiere, are contesting the film's implication that the company reviewed their findings and dismissed them.",
      "\u201cAs recently as December, we reiterated our request to see the filmmakers\u2019 full materials and they did not respond, nor did they include AP\u2019s full response in the film,\" Lauren Easton, an AP spokesperson, said Sunday. \"We were surprised and disappointed that the film portrayed AP as having reviewed the film\u2019s materials and being dismissive of the allegations, which is completely false.\"",
      "The film\u2019s investigation was led by husband-and-wife team of Gary Knight, founder of the VII Foundation, and producer Fiona Turner. Bao Nguyen, a Vietnamese American filmmaker, directed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a journalist by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI had a healthy skepticism, as I think anyone would, going against a 53-year-old truth. ... But as a storyteller and a filmmaker, I thought it was my both or my responsibility and my privilege to be able to uplift the story of individuals like Nghe.\u201d",
      "Before having seen the film, the AP conducted its own investigation over six months and concluded it had \u201cno reason to believe anyone other than Ut took the photo.\u201d Now, the AP is calling on the filmmakers to lift the non-disclosure agreements they placed on their subjects to allow the company to investigate more fully.",
      "\u201cAP stands ready to review any and all evidence and new information about this photo,\" Easton said.",
      "Knight and Turner met with AP in London last June about the allegations. According to the AP, filmmakers requested the news organization sign a non-disclosure agreement before they provided their evidence. AP would not. The film suggests that evidence was presented to the AP, which the AP says is not true.",
      "A primary source in the film is Carl Robinson, then an AP photo editor in Saigon, who was overruled in his judgment not to use the picture by Horst Faas, AP's Saigon chief of photos. Robinson says in the film that Faas instructed him to \u201cmake it staff\u201d and credit Ut for the photo. Both Faas and Yuichi \u201cJackson\u201d Ishizaki, who developed the film, are dead. Robinson, 81, was dismissed by the AP in 1978.",
      "On Saturday, a Sundance Institute moderator asked why he wanted to come forward with the allegations now. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to die before this story came out,\u201d Robinson told the audience after the screening. \u201cI wanted to find (Nghe) and say sorry.\u201d",
      "A variety of witnesses interviewed by AP, including renowned correspondents such as Fox Butterfield and Peter Arnett and the photo\u2019s subject herself, Phuc, say they are certain Ut took the photo.",
      "Robinson was one such person the AP attempted to speak to during their investigation but \u201cwere told we could only do so under conditions\" that they said would have prevented them from \u201ctaking swift action if necessary.\u201d",
      "The film\u2019s investigation took over two years. The journalists enlisted a French forensics team, INDEX, to help determine the likelihood of whether Ut had been in a position to take the photo. The forensics team concluded that it was highly unlikely that Ut could have done it.",
      "Ut's attorney, James Hornstein, had this to say Sunday after the premiere: \u201cIn due course, we will proceed to right this wrong in a courtroom where Nick Ut\u2019s reputation will be vindicated.\u201d",
      "Knight referenced AP\u2019s investigation Saturday, telling the audience that the company's statement is available online. \u201cThey said they\u2019re open always to examining the truth. And I think it was a very reasonable thing to say,\u201d Knight said. \u201cOur story is here and it\u2019s here for you all to see.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThings happen in the field in the heat of the moment. ... We\u2019re all stronger if we examine ourselves, ask tough questions, and we\u2019re open and honest about what goes on in our profession. Now more than ever, I would argue.\"",
      "\u201cThe Stringer\u201d does not yet have distribution plans.",

      "The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic likely originated from a laboratory",
      "WASHINGTON -- The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has \u201clow confidence\u201d in its own conclusion.",
      "The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director.",
      "The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory.",
      "Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities.",
      "\u201cCIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,\u201d a spokesperson for the agency wrote in a statement about the agency's assessment.",
      "Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs.",
      "Lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths.",
      "While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "Some official investigations, however, have raised the the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago a report by the Department of Energy concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding.",
      "Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario.",
      "\u201cThe lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,\u201d Ratcliffe said in 2023.",
      "The CIA \u201cwill continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information that could change CIA\u2019s assessment,\u201d the agency spokesperson said."

      "Officials say they have recaptured the final four monkeys who escaped two months ago from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research",
      "YEMASSEE, S.C. -- Authorities in South Carolina said Friday the last four of 43 escaped monkeys have been recaptured after two months living in the woods, weathering a rare snowstorm and being temped back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.",
      "The rhesus macaque monkeys, all females, made a break for it after police say an employee did not fully lock their enclosure at Alpha Genesis, a facility that breeds them for medical research \u2014 known to locals as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d",
      "The recaptured monkeys appeared to be in good health, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post, without further details.",
      "While they were on the loose, the area saw its first snow in seven years, accumulating up to 3 inches (8 centimeters).",
      "The rhesus macaques made a break for it on Nov. 6, and mostly hung around near the facility. They're about the size of a cat, weighing roughly 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "It appears a worker unintentionally left the gates unlocked when the monkeys escaped, Westergaard said in November. Workers were supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure.",
      "The monkeys posed no risk to public health, said Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police.",
      "Alpha Guard employees kept an eye on the monkeys and set out humane traps. Most were lured back with food and were given peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and \"monkey biscuits\" \u2014 a high-protein Purina Monkey Chow specially formulated for the rhesus macaques.",
      "The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers. Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "The compound is about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia."

      "Looking for a quick fix for their fast-growing electricity diets, tech giants are increasingly looking to strike deals that would let them plug directly into power plants",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Looking for a quick fix for their fast-growing electricity diets, tech giants are increasingly looking to strike deals with power plant owners to plug in directly, avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.",
      "It's raising questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it's fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid. Federal regulators are trying to figure out what to do about it, and quickly.",
      "Front and center is the data center that Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, is building next to the Susquehanna nuclear plant in eastern Pennsylvania.",
      "The arrangement between the plant's owners and AWS \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 is the first such to come before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. For now, FERC has rejected a deal that could eventually send 960 megawatts \u2014 about 40% of the plant's capacity \u2014 to the data center. That's enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "That leaves the deal and others that likely would follow in limbo. It's not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural ground, will take up the matter again or how the change in presidential administrations might affect things.",
      "\u201cThe companies, they\u2019re very frustrated because they have a business opportunity now that\u2019s really big,\u201d said Bill Green, the director of the MIT Energy Initiative. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re delayed five years in the queue, for example \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it would be five years, but years anyway \u2014 they might completely miss the business opportunity.\u201d",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "That's spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants. In December, California-based Oklo announced an agreement to provide 12 gigawatts to data center developer Switch from small nuclear reactors powered by nuclear waste.",
      "Federal officials say fast development of data centers is vital to the economy and national security, including to keep pace with China in the artificial intelligence race.",
      "For AWS, the deal with Susquehanna satisfies its need for reliable power that meets its internal requirements for sources that don't emit planet-warming greenhouse gases, like coal, oil or gas-fueled plants.",
      "Big Tech also wants to stand up their centers fast. But tech's voracious appetite for energy comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels.",
      "They can build data centers in a couple years, said Aaron Tinjum of the Data Center Coalition. But in some areas, getting connected to the congested electricity grid can take four years, and sometimes much more, he said.",
      "Plugging directly into a power plant would take years off their development timelines.",
      "In theory, the AWS deal would let Susquehanna sell power for more than they get by selling into the grid. Talen Energy, Susquehanna\u2019s majority owner, projected the deal would bring as much as $140 million in electricity sales in 2028, though it didn't disclose exactly how much AWS will pay for the power.",
      "The profit potential is one that other nuclear plant operators, in particular, are embracing after years of financial distress and frustration with how they are paid in the broader electricity markets. Many say they have been forced to compete in some markets against a flood of cheap natural gas as well as state-subsidized solar and wind energy.",
      "Power plant owners also say the arrangement benefits the wider public, by bypassing the costly buildout of long power lines and leaving more transmission capacity on the grid for everyone else.",
      "A favorable ruling from FERC could open the door to many more huge data centers and other massive power users like hydrogen plants and bitcoin miners, analysts say.",
      "FERC\u2019s 2-1 rejection in November was procedural. Recent comments by commissioners suggest they weren't ready to decide how to regulate such a novel matter without more study.",
      "In the meantime, the agency is hearing arguments for and against the Susquehanna-AWS deal.",
      "Monitoring Analytics, the market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid, wrote in a filing to FERC that the impact would be \u201cextreme\u201d if the Susquehanna-AWS model were extended to all nuclear power plants in the territory.",
      "Energy prices would increase significantly and there's no explanation for how rising demand for power will be met even before big power plants drop out of the supply mix, it said.",
      "Separately, two electric utility owners \u2014 which make money in deregulated states from building out the grid and delivering power \u2014 have protested that the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement amounts to freeloading off a grid that ordinary customers pay to build and maintain. Chicago-based Exelon and Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power say the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement would allow AWS to avoid $140 million a year that it would otherwise owe.",
      "Susquehanna\u2019s owners say the data center won't be on the grid and question why it should have to pay to maintain it. But critics contend that the power plant itself is benefiting from taxpayer subsidies and ratepayer-subsidized services, and shouldn't be able to strike deals with private customers that could increase costs for others.",
      "FERC's decision will have \u201cmassive repercussions for the entire country\u201d because it will set a precedent for how FERC and grid operators will handle the waiting avalanche of similar requests from data center companies and nuclear plants, said Jackson Morris of the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Stacey Burbure, a vice president for American Electric Power, told FERC at a hearing in November that it needs to move quickly.",
      "\u201cThe timing of this issue is before us,\" she said, \u201cand if we take our typical five years to get this perfect, it will be too late.\u201d",

      "Delving into her daughter\u2019s phone after her death, Mistre discovered videos promoting suicide methods, tutorials and comments encouraging users to go beyond \u201cmere suicide attempts.\u201d She said TikTok\u2019s algorithm had repeatedly pushed such content to her daughter.",
      "\u201cIt was brainwashing,\u201d said Mistre, who lives in Cassis, near Marseille, in the south of France. \u201cThey normalized depression and self-harm, turning it into a twisted sense of belonging.\u201d",
      "Now Mistre and six other families are suing TikTok France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material. Out of the seven families, two experienced the loss of a child.",
      "Asked about the lawsuit, TikTok said its guidelines forbid any promotion of suicide and that it employs 40,000 trust and safety professionals worldwide \u2014 hundreds of which are French-speaking moderators \u2014 to remove dangerous posts. The company also said it refers users who search for suicide-related videos to mental health services.",
      "Before killing herself, Marie Le Tiec made several videos to explain her decision, citing various difficulties in her life, and quoted a song by the Louisiana-based emo rap group Suicideboys, who are popular on TikTok.",
      "Her mother also claims that her daughter was repeatedly bullied and harassed at school and online. In addition to the lawsuit, the 51-year-old mother and her husband have filed a complaint against five of Marie\u2019s classmates and her previous high school.",
      "Above all, Mistre blames TikTok, saying that putting the app \"in the hands of an empathetic and sensitive teenager who does not know what is real from what is not is like a ticking bomb.\u201d",
      "Scientists have not established a clear link between social media and mental health problems or psychological harm, said Gr\u00e9goire Borst, a professor of psychology and cognitive neuroscience at Paris-Cit\u00e9 University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to show clear cause and effect in this area,\u201d Borst said, citing a leading peer-reviewed study that found only 0.4% of the differences in teenagers\u2019 well-being could be attributed to social media use.",
      "Additionally, Borst pointed out that no current studies suggest TikTok is any more harmful than rival apps such as Snapchat, X, Facebook or Instagram.",
      "While most teens use social media without significant harm, the real risks, Borst said, lie with those already facing challenges such as bullying or family instability.",
      "\u201cWhen teenagers already feel bad about themselves and spend time exposed to distorted images or harmful social comparisons,\" it can worsen their mental state, Borst said.",
      "Lawyer Laure Boutron-Marmion, who represents the seven families suing TikTok, said their case is based on \u201cextensive evidence.\u201d The company \"can no longer hide behind the claim that it\u2019s not their responsibility because they don\u2019t create the content,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that TikTok\u2019s algorithm is designed to trap vulnerable users in cycles of despair for profit and seeks reparations for the families.",
      "\u201cTheir strategy is insidious,\u201d Mistre said. \u201cThey hook children into depressive content to keep them on the platform, turning them into lucrative re-engagement products.\u201d",
      "Boutron-Marmion noted that TikTok\u2019s Chinese version, Douyin, features much stricter content controls for young users. It includes a \u201cyouth mode\u201d mandatory for users under 14 that restricts screen time to 40 minutes a day and offers only approved content.",
      "\u201cIt proves they can moderate content when they choose to,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said. \u201cThe absence of these safeguards here is telling.\u201d",
      "A report titled \u201cChildren and Screens,\u201d commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron in April and to which Borst contributed, concluded that certain algorithmic features should be considered addictive and banned from any app in France. The report also called for restricting social media access for minors under 15 in France. Neither measure has been adopted.",
      "TikTok, which faced being shut down in the U.S. until President Donald Trump suspended a ban on it, has also come under scrutiny globally.",
      "The U.S. has seen similar legal efforts by parents. One lawsuit in Los Angeles County accuses Meta and its platforms Instagram and Facebook, as well as Snapchat and TikTok, of designing defective products that cause serious injuries. The lawsuit lists three teens who died by suicide. In another complaint, two tribal nations accuse major social media companies, including YouTube owner Alphabet, of contributing to high rates of suicide among Native youths.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents who had lost children while testifying last year in the U.S. Senate.",
      "In December, Australia enacted a groundbreaking law banning social media accounts for children under 16.",
      "In France, Boutron-Marmion expects TikTok Limited Technologies, the European Union subsidiary for ByteDance \u2014 the Chinese company that owns TikTok \u2014 to answer the allegations in the first quarter of 2025. Authorities will later decide whether and when a trial would take place.",
      "When contacted by The Associated Press, TikTok said it had not been notified about the French lawsuit, which was filed in November. It could take months for the French justice system to process the complaint and for authorities in Ireland \u2014 home to TikTok\u2019s European headquarters \u2014 to formally notify the company, Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "Instead, a Tiktok spokesperson highlighted company guidelines that prohibit content promoting suicide or self-harm.",
      "Critics argue that TikTok\u2019s claims of robust moderation fall short.",
      "Imran Ahmed, the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, dismissed TikTok\u2019s assertion that over 98.8% of harmful videos had been flagged and removed between April and June.",
      "When asked about the blind spots of their moderation efforts, social media platforms claim that users are able to bypass detection by using ambiguous language or allusions that algorithms struggle to flag, Ahmed said.",
      "The term \u201calgospeak\u201d has been coined to describe techniques such as using zebra or armadillo emojis to talk about cutting yourself, or the Swiss flag emoji as an allusion to suicide.",
      "Such code words \"aren\u2019t particularly sophisticated,\u201d Ahmed said. \"The only reason TikTok can\u2019t find them when independent researchers, journalists and others can is because they\u2019re not looking hard enough,\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "Ahmed\u2019s organization conducted a study in 2022 simulating the experience of a 13-year-old girl on TikTok.",
      "\u201cWithin 2.5 minutes, the accounts were served self-harm content,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cBy eight minutes, they saw eating disorder content. On average, every 39 seconds, the algorithm pushed harmful material.\u201d",
      "The algorithm \u201cknows that eating disorder and self-harm content is especially addictive\u201d for young girls.",
      "For Mistre, the fight is deeply personal. Sitting in her daughter\u2019s room, where she has kept the decor untouched for the last three years, she said parents must know about the dangers of social media.",
      "Had she known about the content being sent to her daughter, she never would have allowed her on TikTok, she said. Her voice breaks as she describes Marie as a \u201csunny, funny\u201d teenager who dreamed of becoming a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIn memory of Marie, I will fight as long as I have the strength,\u201d she said. \u201cParents need to know the truth. We must confront these platforms and demand accountability.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is clashing with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the Stargate artificial intelligence infrastructure project touted by President Donald Trump, the latest in a feud between the two tech billionaires that started on OpenAI's board and is now testing Musk's influence with the new president.",
      "Trump on Tuesday had talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion through a new partnership formed by OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, alongside Oracle and SoftBank.",
      "The new entity, Stargate, is already starting to build out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of fast-evolving AI technology.",
      "Trump declared it \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential\u201d under his new administration, with an initial private investment of $100 billion that could reach five times that sum.",
      "But Musk, a close Trump adviser who helped bankroll his campaign and now leads a government cost-cutting initiative, questioned the value of the investment hours later.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t actually have the money,\u201d Musk wrote on his social platform X. \u201cSoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\u201d",
      "Altman responded Wednesday to say Musk was \u201cwrong, as you surely know\u201d and inviting Musk to come visit the first site in Texas that is already under construction.",
      "\"(T)his is great for the country. i realize what is great for the country isn\u2019t always what\u2019s optimal for your companies, but in your new role i hope you\u2019ll mostly put (America) first,\u201d Altman wrote, using a U.S. flag emoji to represent America.",
      "The public clash over Stargate is part of a years-long dispute between Musk and Altman that began with a boardroom rivalry over who should run OpenAI, which both men helped found.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",
      "Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. A hearing is set for February in a California federal court.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and X, last year started his own rival AI company, xAI, that is building its own big data center in Memphis, Tennessee. Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.",
      "Tech news outlet The Information first reported on an OpenAI data center project called Stargate in March 2024, indicating that it's been in the works long before Trump announced it.",
      "Another company \u2014 Crusoe Energy Systems \u2014 announced in July it was building a large and \u201cspecially designed AI data center\u201d at the northwest edge of Abilene, Texas at a site run by energy technology company Lancium. Crusoe and Lancium said in a joint statement at the time that the project was \u201csupported by a multibillion-dollar investment\u201d but didn't disclose its backers.",
      "AI technology requires huge amounts of electricity to build and operate and both companies said the project would be powered with renewable sources such as nearby solar farms, in a way that Lancium CEO Michael McNamara said would \u201cdeliver the maximum amount of green energy at the lowest possible cost.\u201d Crusoe said it would own and develop the facility.",
      "It's not clear how and when that project became the first phase of the Stargate investment revealed by Trump. Abilene Mayor Weldon Hurt said construction began about nine months ago but \u201cwe didn\u2019t know it was going to be quite this big. We thought it was going to be about a third of this size.\u201d",
      "Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said Tuesday that the Abilene project is the first of about 10 data center buildings currently being built and that number could expand to 20.",
      "Hurt told The Associated Press that the region surrounding Abilene, a city of about 130,000 people, benefits from a wealth of energy sources, including oil, gas, solar and some of the \u201clargest wind farms in the world,\u201d though Trump signaled opposition to wind power this week by temporarily halting approval of wind projects on federal lands.",
      "\u201cWe have the capability to produce the energy for this market so it really means a lot for a town like Abilene,\u201d Hurt said. \u201cTo have this opportunity here in west-central Texas, to have something like this to make Abilene substantial, we\u2019re just excited about it.\u201d",
      "Missing from Trump's press conference Tuesday was Microsoft, which has long supported OpenAI with billions of dollars in investments and enabling its data centers to be used to build the models behind ChatGPT and other generative AI tools.",
      "Microsoft is also a technology partner in the Stargate project, along with chipmakers Nvidia and Arm, but put out a statement noting that its OpenAI partnership will \u201cevolve\u201d in a way that enables OpenAI \u201cto build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.\u201d",
      "Asked about Musk's comments about the Stargate deal Wednesday during a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella pivoted to his company's own $80 billion plan to build out its global AI infrastructure, of which $50 billion is being spent in the U.S.",
      "\u201cLook, all I know is, I\u2019m good for my $80 billion,\u201d said Nadella, laughing."

      "Samsung is injecting another dose of artificial intelligence into the next version of its Galaxy smartphones, escalating an effort to simplify people\u2019s lives while deepening their dependence on a device that accompanies them almost everywhere",
      "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Samsung is injecting another dose of artificial intelligence into its next lineup of Galaxy smartphones, escalating an effort to simplify people\u2019s lives while deepening their dependence on a device that accompanies them almost everywhere.",
      "The three Galaxy S25 models unveiled Wednesday in San Jose, California, are the second generation to be designed for the AI age \u2014 a craze that market-leading Apple joined last September with the release of the iPhone 16. Most of the hardware on the Galaxy S25 is mostly the same as last year's model, except for a faster chip and a more powerful ultrawide lens on the camera.",
      "In its next phase, Samsung is positioning the Galaxy S25 as an \u201cAI companion\u201d capable of pulling more requests out of conversations, learning people\u2019s routines, anticipating people's needs and performing more technological tricks, such as being able to remove unwanted sounds from videos or identifying the name of a song upon request.",
      "The AI on the new Galaxy phones has been designed to toggle from one app to another to fetch, summarize and manage information, entertainment and other content stored on the devices. In an attempt to make the technology even more indispensable, the AI on Galaxy S25 will be able to create customized digital dossiers on users' behavior patterns and other unique characteristics that Samsung is calling a \u201cpersonal data engine.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything you see here is the beginning of a new reality,\" said TM Roh, the Samsung executive who oversees its smartphones. \u201cThings that you thought you could never do, but now you can.\u201d",
      "As Apple has been doing with its AI features, Samsung is promising that its technology will shield users' privacy while also peering into their lives. Samsung is providing the protection primarily by keeping all the knowledge accrued by its AI technology on the Galaxy devices \u2014 within a digital fortress the company nicknamed after Fort Knox, the Kentucky Army base seated next to the U.S. government\u2019s depository for gold.",
      "After raising prices last year, Samsung is standing pat with the Galaxy S25 phones, with the standard model starting at $800, the Plus model at $1,000 and the Ultra model at $1,300. The phones are scheduled to be in stores starting Feb. 7.",
      "Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson thinks the Galaxy S25 models \u201cwill offer a more intuitive user experience with more integrated vocal and cross-app experiences, but AI is not yet a key reason to buy a new smartphone.\u201d",
      "Samsung is doubling down on its AI bet after getting a sales bump from the past year's emphasis on the technology. The South Korean company sold 32 million of its Galaxy S24 models from January through September last year, a 25% increase from the same time in the previous year, according to the research group Canalys.",
      "But Samsung didn\u2019t fare as well in the lower end of the smartphone market, where it was hurt by cheaper devices made by Chinese competitors. That\u2019s one of the reasons Samsung\u2019s total smartphone shipments fell by 1% last year, leaving it slightly behind Apple in the worldwide market, according to the research firm International Data Crop.",
      "As was the case with last year\u2019s models, the Galaxy S25 will draw heavily on AI technology made by Google, the maker of the free operating system Android that Samsung has long used for its smartphones.",
      "Some of the new AI tricks, such as the ability to deploy Google's \u201ccircle to search\u201d technology to quickly identify the song title of music playing in a video, will debut on the Galaxy S25 before coming to other Android phones later this year. Google also has been planting more AI on its own phone, the Pixel, but that device still lags far behind the iPhone and Galaxy.",

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have detected cosmic waves that sound like birds chirping in an unexpected place.",
      "These bursts of plasma, called chorus waves, ripple at the same frequency as human hearing. When converted to audio signals, their sharp notes mimic high-pitched bird calls.",
      "Researchers have captured such sounds in space before, but now they have sensed the chirping waves from much farther away: over 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) from Earth, where they've never been measured before.",
      "\u201cThat opens up a lot of new questions about the physics that could be possible in this area,\u201d said Allison Jaynes, a space physicist at the University of Iowa who was not involved with the work.",
      "Scientists still aren\u2019t sure how the perturbations happen, but they think Earth\u2019s magnetic field may have something to do with it.",
      "The chorus has been picked up on radio antennas for decades, including receivers at an Antarctica research station in the 1960s. And twin spacecraft \u2014 NASA's Van Allen Probes \u2014 heard the chirps from Earth's radiation belts at a closer distance than the newest detection.",
      "The latest notes were picked up by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites, launched in 2015 to explore the Earth and sun's magnetic fields. The new research was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "Chorus waves have also been spotted near other planets including Jupiter and Saturn. They can even produce high-energy electrons capable of scrambling satellite communications.",

      "Trump removed the Spanish version of the page in 2017. At that time, White House officials said they would reinstate it. President Joe Biden reinstated the page in 2021.",
      "The page's removal coincided with Trump\u2019s first-day wave of executive orders highlighted by the launch of an illegal immigration crackdown that was one of his key campaign pledges. Trump on Monday declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border and announced plans to send U.S. troops to help support immigration agents and restrict refugees and asylum.",

      "Anthony Hernandez, a paralegal in the nation's capital, wasn\u2019t initially aware of the move and said it suggests what the coming years of a second Trump presidency would look like, with specific issues making headlines while \u201cminor but equally malicious things like that go unnoticed.\u201d",
      "\u201cA move like shutting down the Spanish White House page and X profile serves no purpose other than to cut off resources for millions of Hispanic Americans and immigrants attempting to enter the United States legally,\" Hernandez said. \"And it\u2019s a slap in the face to the millions of Hispanic voters that supported him in this recent election.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is Cuban American and speaks Spanish. At his swearing-in Tuesday, he gave remarks in Spanish, thanking God, his family and Trump.",
      "Meanwhile, Hispanic leaders and communication strategy experts expressed surprise with the page's removal, given Trump\u2019s popularity with certain Latino voters.",

      "Joining Trump fresh off his inauguration at the White House were Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle. All three credited Trump for helping to make the project possible, even though building has already started and the project goes back to 2024.",
      "\u201cThis will be the most important project of this era,\" said Altman, CEO of OpenAI.",
      "Ellison noted that the data centers are already under construction with 10 being built so far. The chairman of Oracle suggested that the project was also tied to digital health records and would make it easier to treat diseases such as cancer by possibly developing a customized vaccine.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning of golden age,\u201d said Son, referencing Trump's statement that the U.S. would be in a \u201cgolden age\u201d with him back in the White House.",
      "Son, a billionaire based in Japan, already committed in December to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. He previously committed to $50 billion in new investments ahead of Trump's first term, which included a large stake in the troubled office-sharing company WeWork.",
      "While Trump has seized on similar announcements to show that his presidency is boosting the economy, there were already expectations of a massive buildout in data centers and electricity plants needed for the development of AI, which holds the promise of increasing productivity by automating work but also the risk of displacing jobs if poorly implemented.",
      "The initial plans for Stargate go back to the Biden administration. Tech news outlet The Information first reported on the project in March 2024. OpenAI has long relied on Microsoft data centers to build its AI systems, but it has increasingly signaled an interest in building its own data centers.",
      "OpenAI wrote in a letter to the Biden administration\u2019s Commerce Department last fall that planning and permitting for such projects \u201ccan be lengthy and complex, particularly for energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Other partners in the project include Microsoft, investor MGX and the chipmakers Arm and NVIDIA, according to separate statements by Oracle and OpenAI.",
      "The push to build data centers predates Trump's presidency. Last October, the financial company Blackstone estimated that the U.S. would see $1 trillion invested in data centers over five years, with another $1 trillion being committed internationally.",
      "Those estimates for investments suggest that much of the new capital will go through Stargate as OpenAI has established itself as a sector leader with the 2022 launch of its ChatGPT, a chatbot that captivated the public imagination with its ability to answer complex questions and perform basic business tasks.",
      "The White House has put an emphasis on making it easier to build out new electricity generation in anticipation of AI's expansion, knowing that the United States is in a competitive race against China to develop a technology increasingly being adopted by businesses.",
      "Still, the regulatory outlook for AI remains somewhat uncertain as Trump on Monday overturned the 2023 order signed by then-President Joe Biden to create safety standards and watermarking of AI-generated content, among other goals, in hopes of putting guardrails on the technology's possible risks to national security and economic well-being.",
      "CBS News first reported that Trump would be announcing the AI investment.",
      "Trump supporter Elon Musk, worth more than $400 billion, was an early investor in OpenAI but has since challenged its move to for-profit status and has started his own AI company, xAI. Musk is also in charge of the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d created formally on Monday by Trump with the goal of reducing government spending.",
      "Trump previously in January announced a $20 billion investment by DAMAC Properties in the United Arab Emirates to build data centers tied to AI.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly 60 senior USAID employees were placed on leave, sources said.",
      "Internal communications reviewed by ABC News show that the Trump administration plans to strictly implement an executive order from the president mandating a 90-day freeze on almost all U.S. foreign aid amid a review, a measure that already has sparked widespread concern among humanitarian organizations.",
      "\"We get tired of giving massive amounts of money to countries that hate us, don't we?\" President Donald Trump said in a speech during the House Republicans' annual retreat in Florida on Monday, touting a blizzard of executive actions he had taken since returning to the White House.",
      "In a memo sent to U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) staff over the weekend, a high-level official within the agency stressed their \"responsibility\" to carry out Trump's directive and signaled that it would be difficult to secure waivers to continue funding for programs during the pause, which he called \"a complete halt.\"",
      "\"It is important to emphasize that it is no longer business as usual. Every program will be thoroughly scrutinized,\" Ken Jackson, USAID's assistant to the administrator for management and resources, wrote.",
      "Jackson said that the agency's only exceptions currently in place covered spending on emergency humanitarian food aid and travel for government officials who were returning to their duty stations, adding that employees should be ready \"to provide detailed information and justification\" for these expenses.",
      "Any waivers for other spending would need to clear multiple hurdles for approval, including proving that the program receiving funding was lifesaving or necessary for U.S. national security.",
      "Failure to comply with the pause or other new policies \"will result in disciplinary action,\" Jackson warned USAID staff.",
      "That warning was not an empty threat. Late Monday, multiple sources said that nearly 60 senior USAID officials had been placed on leave, including nearly all senior attorneys for the agency.",
      "According to an email obtained by ABC News, acting USAID administrator Jason Gray accused the agency of skirting Trump's executive orders but provided no information about the alleged violations.",
      "\"We have identified several actions within USAID that appear to be designed to circumvent the President's Executive orders and the mandate from the American people,\" Gray wrote in the email. \"As a result, we have placed a number of USAID employees on administrative leave with full pay and benefits until further notice while we complete our analysis of these actions.\"",
      "A separate memo sent to State Department employees last week which was also reviewed by ABC News instructed officials overseeing projects funded by grants and awards that have already been distributed to issue immediate \"stop-work orders,\" making exceptions for some travel and administrative expenses, emergency food aid, and foreign military financing to both Egypt and Israel.",
      "An administration official said on Monday that a template for submitting waiver requests had been made available and that the State Department was reviewing numerous applications that had already been submitted, but could not give a timeline for when any decisions would be made.",
      "The State Department officially announced the implementation of the freeze on Sunday.",
      "\"Secretary Rubio has paused all U.S. foreign assistance funded by or through the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for review,\" the department's spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, said in statement. \"He is initiating a review of all foreign assistance programs to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.\"",
      "By then, panic had already set in among international aid groups that rely on U.S. funding. Sources within the international community said the freeze was so expansive that they could hardly believe it was real.",
      "\"The recent stop-work cable from the State Department suspends programs that support America's global leadership and creates dangerous vacuums that China and our adversaries will quickly fill,\" InterAction, the largest alliance of international aid organizations, said in a statement.",
      "\"This halt interrupts critical life-saving work including clean water to infants, basic education for kids, ending the trafficking of girls, and providing medications to children and others suffering from disease. It stops assistance in countries critical to U.S. interests, including Taiwan, Syria, and Pakistan. And, it halts decades of life-saving work through PEPFAR that helps babies to be born HIV-free,\" the statement continued.",
      "Beyond concern for their work, some organizations and officials have also expressed confusion. Many were caught off guard by the State Department's implementation of Trump's order, which they initially believed wouldn't impact programs funded through congressional appropriations.",
      "\"The aid community is grappling with just how existential this aid suspension is - we know this will have life or death consequences for millions around the globe, as programs that depend on this funding grind to a halt without a plan or safety net,\" Abby Maxman, the president and CEO of Oxfam, said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "\"This decision must be reversed, and funding and programming must be allowed to move forward. But at the very least, the administration must communicate clearly so the aid community can plan for the future and determine how to carry on our lifesaving work,\" Maxman added.",
      "Critics of the freeze believe dissent from international aid organizations and U.S. officials has been muted due to fear of retribution from the administration.",
      "In his memo to USAID employees, Jackson stipulated that one of the new policies they must comply with if they wished to avoid disciplinary action was a requirement that all external communication, including with the State Department, first be approved by the agency.",

      "In 2020, as a pandemic raged across the globe, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took to social media to appeal to his hundreds of thousands of followers on Facebook.",
      "The son of the late U.S. Attorney General and New York Sen. Bobby Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, the younger Kennedy said he was looking for parents whose children had been vaccinated against a different virus -- human papillomavirus or HPV -- and later grew sick.",
      "Public health researchers and doctors said there was no evidence that the vaccine, Gardasil, was linked to the health problems he cited, noting 160 favorable studies on safety. A federal court created to compensate people injured by vaccines also had already rejected a similar claim, citing \"insufficient proof\" that the vaccine was behind the plaintiff's health issues.",
      "But in his posts, Kennedy said that he and lawyer Michael Baum \u2013 whom Kennedy calls \"one of my closest friends\" -- believed there was still a path forward. The families could sue the manufacturer Merck in civil court claiming marketing fraud \u2013 allegations Merck denies.",
      "\"If you have been injured by Gardasil, call us,\" Kennedy wrote on Facebook, posting a toll-free number invoking his famous initials \"RFK.\"",
      "According to financial disclosure documents released last week, Kennedy's primary source of income in the past year were large sums of referral fees from multiple law firms, including Baum's office, whose civil lawsuit against Merck's Gardasil vaccine went to trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court last week.",
      "Kennedy's leading role in building a case against Merck is now raising questions about how he might wield his power as the nation's next health secretary \u2013 a job intended as an impartial overseer in public health \u2013 while in line for potential payouts from a major pharmaceutical company.",
      "\"This disclosure shows that RFK Jr. made millions off of peddling dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracies,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is a Democratic member of the Senate Finance Committee that will oversee Kennedy's nomination.",
      "\"Even worse, if he is confirmed, his finances will still be tied to the outcomes of anti-vaccine lawsuits -- even as he'd be tasked with regulating them as health secretary. These are outrageous conflicts of interest that endanger public health,\" Warren said in a statement provided to reporters.",
      "Kennedy, who is expected to testify for the first time Wednesday before the Senate panel, said he has resigned his work with several law firms, including Wisner Baum, and that if confirmed he would no longer be involved in legal cases.",
      "But in a plan greenlit by federal ethics officials, Kennedy said he plans to retain his right to 10% of fees awarded in contingency cases with Wisner Baum, so long as the cases don't involve the U.S. government. The federal government is not a party in the civil lawsuit against Merck.",
      "\"I am entitled to receive a portion of future recovery in these cases based upon the set percentage as set forth in the referral agreement,\" he wrote.",
      "Kennedy disclosed another $856,559 in income from Wisner Baum referral fees, although the documents do not say which legal cases were tied to those fees. Other income included $8.8 million from his firm Kennedy & Madonna. Kennedy said he was terminating his relationship with the firm, which would no longer use his name.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy declined to comment on the record.",
      "Baum said on Monday that Kennedy was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the Gardasil case, but has not received any compensation related to the lawsuit so far.",
      "\u201cUntil he began running for president, he was co-counsel, not just referring counsel,\" Baum wrote in an email. \"His accumulation of science articles and connections to expert scientists willing to work on the Gardasil case was instrumental to establishing a basis and path for litigating Gardasil induced injury cases.\"",
      "He also is pushing back against suggestions that the the lawsuit is \"anti-vaccine.\u201d Baum said Merck failed to properly warn patients of potential side effects.",
      "In a statement on the civil lawsuit, Merck said \"an overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy of our HPV vaccines. The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims.\"",
      "Robert Krakow, a New York lawyer who specializes in vaccine injury cases and has worked with Kennedy in the past, said referral fees are fairly standard when it comes to personal injury claims.",
      "Kennedy has been a \"galvanizing force\" when it came to questioning vaccine safety, providing a special touch when talking to families because \"he was very sincere and listened to people,\" Krakow said. Using social media platforms to recruit clients is a natural extension of that work, he said.",
      "\"It's not often you have a celebrity do that,\" Krakow said of Kennedy's work to find clients who claim vaccine injuries. \"But there's nothing inherently wrong with recruiting people for referral fees.\"",
      "Reuters was first to report Kennedy's extensive role in the Gardasil vaccine lawsuit.",
      "Because Kennedy's financial arrangement was allowed by ethics officials, it's not clear whether the issue will be a sticking point for Republicans eager to align with Trump. According to the agreement released last week, Kennedy can keep the fees from Wisner Baum so long as the independent ethics office at the Health and Human Services Department determines the case does \"not involve the United States as a party and in which the United States does not have a direct and substantial interest.\"",
      "Kennedy also has insisted in private meetings with senators that he is not \"anti-vaccine,\" but only wants more study, according to one person familiar with the discussions.",
      "The messaging aligns with what Kennedy has said publicly. Kennedy often notes he was vaccinated as a child and opted to vaccinate his own children decades ago. His work as chair and chief litigator of the Children's Heath Defense, which opposes the recommended schedule of vaccines for children, did not begin until around 2015.",
      "\"What I've said is I'm pro-science and pro-safety,\" he told a local New Hampshire television station in 2023.",
      "Still, public health experts and many senators -- several of them old enough to remember serious outbreaks of measles and polio in the 1950s -- have expressed serious concerns about his role in eroding confidence in vaccines, even if he says he won't outright block access to them.",
      "\"We potentially face a massive health hazard, maybe especially for our children,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.",
      "Sanders, who had been seen as someone who might be able to find common ground with Kennedy on environmental and food policy, said the concern with the incoming administration was that \"we may revert back to those terrible days when so many children died\" before age 3.",
      "As head of the Health and Human Services Department, Kennedy would be responsible for the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the selling and marketing of vaccines, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which collects data on vaccines to issue public health recommendations that are closely followed by doctors.",
      "If confirmed, he could insist upon appointing vaccine skeptics to the independent group that reviews FDA data on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy also could alter how information is used from CDC's public reporting system known as \"VAERS\" that allows anyone to flag possible adverse reactions from vaccines. The reports are unverified but used to look for potential patterns that can be investigated.",
      "Health officials say symptoms reported in VAERS are often found to be unrelated from a person's immunization history.",
      "Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Law San Francisco and expert in legal issues on vaccinations, said handing over that process to someone with Kennedy's track record would be unprecedented.",

It's clean as a whistle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's fine for people to have policy differences and ask questions about those differences. I hope no one would impugn Ms. Gabbard's patriotism or her integrity.\u201d",
      "He also pointed to Pete Hegseth\u2019s successful confirmation to become secretary of defense after a tie-breaking vote Friday despite the controversy that surrounded his nomination.",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine -- who was one of three Republicans who voted against Hegseth last week -- expressed caution towards Gabbard.",
      "\u201cThere are several questions I want to follow up on in the hearing,\u201d Collins told The Hill on Monday, adding that there are \"a lot of obvious issues\" with the DNI nominee.",
      "However, Vice President JD Vance remained adamant in supporting Trump's nomination of Gabbard, telling CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, \u201cI feel confident that Tulsi Gabbard will ultimately get through.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is a career military servant who's had a classification at the highest levels for nearly two decades. She has impeccable character, impeccable record of service, and she also is a person who I think is going to bring some trust back to the intelligence services,\u201d Vance said during his first interview since becoming vice president.",
      "Also on Thursday, FBI director nominee Kash Patel, who served in several roles in Trump's first administration, will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his confirmation hearing.",
      "Patel's nomination has similarly faced backlash, particularly regarding his promoting of conspiracy theories, his defense of Jan. 6 rioters and his threats to target journalists, former senior FBI and Department of Justice officials.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters last week that he will not vote to advance Patel\u2019s nomination.",
      "\"After meeting with him and doing this study, I've come to the conclusion that Kash Patel has neither the experience, the judgment or the temperament to serve as head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to take on this awesome responsibility to keep America safe,\" Durbin said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, another member of the Judiciary Committee, called Patel's nomination \"alarming\" after meeting with him last week.",
      "Coons said he questioned Patel on efforts by Trump to use the FBI for political retribution, as well as his calling for the weaponization of the federal government against Trump\u2019s political enemies.",
      "\"I left this meeting still concerned about Mr. Patel\u2019s ability to put past grievances aside and focus the FBI on its core mission of keeping Americans safe,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will face the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday morning. Kennedy has faced criticism over his history of remarks against vaccines and his recent vaccine skepticism. In addition to asking the federal government to revoke authorization of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021, and medical experts have expressed concerns over his views potentially spreading medical misinformation.",
      "Kennedy continues to echo Trump's views. On Sunday, he sent out a fundraising email called Trump's executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization \"a massive win\" for Kennedy's health agenda and for Americans' \"fundamental medical freedom rights.\"",
      "Trump's withdrawal, which has been criticized by medical and health experts, \"marks a turning point for our nation. No more subservience to a globalist organization prioritizing profits over American lives and health,\" Kennedy said in his fundraiser.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 08:08:08 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump signed four more executive orders that aim to reverse several Biden initiatives related to the military.",
    "story": [
      "The president signed the orders while onboard Air Force One on Monday.",
      "President Donald Trump signed four executive orders on Monday that reverse several Biden administration initiatives related to the military and deliver on promises he made on the campaign trail.",
      "Trump signed the orders while onboard Air Force One, White House staff secretary Will Scharf told reporters.",
      "\"First is an executive order, as he alluded to in his speech earlier, reinstating members of the military who were terminated or forced to separate because of the vaccine mandates. The second item was an executive order establishing a process to develop what we're calling an American Iron Dome; a comprehensive missile defense shield to land the American homeland,\" Scharf said.",
      "\"The third executive order that President Trump signed relates to eliminating gender radicalism in the military, and the fourth is about eliminating DEI set asides and DEI offices within the military,\" Scharf added.",
      "In addition those items, Trump signed a proclamation commemorating the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.",
      "Reinstating military members who refused vaccinations",
      "Trump signed an order directing the secretary of defense to \"reinstate service members who were dismissed for refusing the COVID vaccine, with full back pay and benefits,\" according to the White House.",
      "The fact sheet on the order estimates that more than 8,000 troops were discharged between 2021 and 2023 following the Biden administration's policy requiring vaccinations for service members. The order adds that the discharged military personnel will \"receive their former rank.\"",
      "In August 2021, then-Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordered mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for all military personnel. The fact sheet said that the decision was made in \"spite of the scientific evidence,\" and added that it led to the discharge \"healthy service members -- many of whom had natural immunity and dedicated their entire lives to serving our country.\"",
      "The White House also says the vaccine mandate had a \"chilling effect on recruitment,\" noting that the Department of Defense fell 41,000 recruits short of its fiscal year 2023 recruiting goals.",
      "Service members were given the opportunity to rejoin the military in 2023 when the vaccine mandate was rescinded, but the White House fact sheet said that only 43 service members elected to do that. The issue of full back pay is complex and would likely require congressional approval.",
      "The order follows one of Trump's promises from his speech on Inauguration Day, when he said he would make this move shortly after he was sworn in.",
      "Transgender service members",
      "Trump signed an order directing the Department of Defense to update its guidance \"regarding trans-identifying medical standards for military service and to rescind guidance inconsistent with military readiness.\"",
      "The order will require DOD to update all medical standards \"to ensure they prioritize readiness and lethality.\"",
      "The order will also end the use of pronouns in the Department of Defense and will also prohibit males from \"sharing sleeping, changing, or bathing in facilities designated for females.\"",
      "Last week, Trump revoked a Biden administration order allowing transgender people to serve in the military. In 2016, the Pentagon under then-President Barack Obama lifted restrictions on transgender people serving in the armed forces. But in 2017, Trump announced on what was then Twitter that transgender service members would no longer be able to serve openly in the armed forces, citing concerns over costs and readiness. The policy was implemented in 2019 and required transgender service members to serve in line with their biological sex unless they had already successfully transitioned or were grandfathered in under the Obama-era policy.",
      "In 2021, the Trump policy was reversed under the Biden administration, allowing transgender service members to again serve openly and access related medical care.",
      "\"This change to the standards meant that men and women could join the military for the express purpose of transitioning, be nondeployable for a year, and take life-altering hormone therapy that would mean they would be nondeployable unless the military could guarantee the supply of medication,\" now-Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said of the changes under Biden in one of his books.",
      "Iron Dome",
      "Trump has now officially begun the process of creating \"the Iron Dome for America,\" a nod to the Israeli missile defense system.",
      "The order \"directs implementation of a next generation missile defense shield for the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next generation aerial attacks,\" according to a fact sheet obtained by ABC News.",
      "There are very few details about how this type of a system would be developed. There are no details in the fact sheet on a timeline for creating such a system, nor any mention of cost to construct it.",
      "The order follows through on a pledge Trump made a number of times on the campaign trail.",
      "\"Americans deserve an Iron Dome and that's what we're gonna have we're gonna have an Iron Dome,\" Trump said during an New Hampshire rally in October 2023.",
      "As ABC has previously reported, experts say replicating an Iron Dome system for the U.S. wouldn't make much sense, given the U.S. has allies to the north and south, and oceans on either side.",
      "Banning DEI",
      "Another order that Trump signed takes aim at Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs at the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security. The order will ban the use of \"discriminatory race- or sex-based preferences,\" according to a fact sheet about the move.",
      "The order directs Hegseth to internally review cases of \"race- or sex-based discrimination\" based on past DEI policies and requires DOD and DHS to review curriculum to \"eliminate radical DEI and gender ideologies.\"",
      "The fact sheet adds that Trump is committed to a merit-based system with \"sex-neutral policies and colorblind recruitment, promotion, and retention.\" It blamed the so-called \"'woke' assault\" for the military's flagging recruitment numbers.",
      "This is just the latest of actions the Trump administration has taken to shut down DEI programs throughout the federal government and among federal contractors and to put pressure on private entities to end similar programs.",

      "He recently called for the Joint Chiefs chairman to be fired for being \"woke.\"",
      "Just months after calling for his ouster, incoming Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was greeted at the Pentagon on Monday by Gen. CQ Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "Brown saluted Hegseth as his motorcade arrived, then shook his hand as the two exchanged pleasantries. With Brown by his side, Hegseth approached a line of waiting reporters and took several questions, including one on whether he intends to fire the general.",
      "\"I'm standing with him right now,\" Hegseth said, patting Brown, only the second Black officer after Colin Powell to serve in the job, on the shoulder. \"I look forward to working with him.\"",
      "Hegseth's past comments on Brown were not so sanguine.",
      "\"First of all, you've got to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs,\" Hegseth said in a November appearance on the \"Shawn Ryan Show,\" days before President Donald Trump nominated him to lead the Defense Department.",
      "He continued, \"But any general that was involved -- general, admiral, whatever -- that was involved in any of the DEI woke s--- has got to go. Either you're in for warfighting, and that's it. That's the only litmus test we care about.\"",
      "Hegseth also lambasted Brown several times in his book, \"The War on Warriors.\"",
      "\"The military standards, once the hallmark for competency, professionalism, and 'mission first' outcomes, have officially been subsumed by woke priorities,\" he wrote. \"You think CQ Brown will think intuitively about external threats and internal readiness? No chance. He built his generalship dutifully pursuing the radical positions of left-wing politicians, who in turn rewarded him with promotions.\"",
      "Brown has been vocal about what he sees as the importance of race-based diversity in the military. In 2022, while chief of staff of the Air Force, Brown signed a memo calling for the service to work toward lowering the percentage of white officer applicants while raising those of other races.",
      "\"These goals are aspirational, aligning resources to invest in our long-term objectives and will not be used in any manner that undermines our merit-based processes,\" the memo said.",
      "In his new role, Hegseth could recommend removing Brown and other military leaders, and Trump would have the authority to do so.",
      "Both Hegseth and Trump have sharply criticized military leaders involved in the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan as well as those allegedly pushing \"woke\" ideology. While there could be legal challenges in trying to outright kick generals or admirals out of the military should they refuse a request to resign, the commander in chief has the authority to remove senior officers from their current positions and reassign them, effectively ending their careers.",
      "Brown drew praise for a June 2020 video titled \"Here's what I'm thinking about\" that he released in response to the nationwide protests and unrest sparked by Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police officer.",
      "In the highly personal video, Brown recounted his own experiences with racism and his perspective as a Black man and Black military leader.",
      "There were some positive signs for Brown even before Monday's polite greeting, when he had an amiable encounter with Trump at last month's Army-Navy football game.",
      "During the second quarter, Trump and Brown talked for roughly 20 minutes about football as well as the situation in the Middle East and Ukraine, a U.S. official told ABC News. Brown also had a quick introduction and handshake with Hegseth at the game.",

      "They couldn't be trusted to implement the president's agenda,\u00a0officials said.",
      "The Justice Department is firing \"over a dozen\" officials who were part of former special counsel Jack Smith's teams that prosecuted President Donald Trump, officials confirmed to ABC News Monday.",
      "Acting Attorney General James McHenry transmitted letters to the officials informing them of their termination, officials said, that said given their part in the prosecutions they couldn't be trusted in \"faithfully implementing the president's agenda.\"",
      "It's not immediately clear the exact number of officials who were fired on Monday, but the move was largely expected after President Trump's threats leading up to the 2024 election stating he planned to fire Smith \"on day one.\"",
      "Smith resigned prior to Trump taking office and submitted his final report to former Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland released Vol. 1 of Smith's final report detailing Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, but he was blocked by District Judge Aileen Cannon from sharing with Congress the second volume of Trump's report detailing his investigation of Trump's mishandling of classified documents after leaving his first administration.",
      "Separately, an official confirmed to ABC News that the top career official in the Justice Department, Bradley Weinsheimer, was recently informed he was being reassigned out of his role. Weinsheimer was a longtime career public official and gained notoriety last year in exchanges with President Joe Biden's attorneys as they sought to prevent Special Counsel Robert Hur from releasing portions of his final report that detailed Biden's diminished capacities.",
      "\"You played a significant role in prosecuting President Trump,\" the email from Acting Attorney General McHenry said to the officials fired Monday. \"The proper functioning of the government critically depends on the trust superior officials place in their subordinates. Given your significant role in prosecuting the President, I do not believe that the leadership of the department can trust you to assist in implementing the President's agenda faithfully.\"",
      "While several career officials who played prominent roles in Smith's prosecutions departed prior to Trump taking office -- including former top DOJ national security official Jay Bratt -- several other career attorneys who were on Smith's team chose to remain and return to roles in DOJ's national security and criminal divisions.",
      "Among those officials were longtime career trial attorneys Molly Gaston, J.P. Cooney, Mary Dohrmann and Anne McNamara, all of whom were informed of their terminations Monday, an official confirmed to ABC News.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump wants to stop a lawsuit against his Truth Social company by arguing that, while he's president, he should be immune from any civil suit filed in state court.",
    "story": [
      "The president is being sued by two co-founders of his Trump Media company.",
      "In a case that sits squarely at the intersection of his business and political interests, President Donald Trump is trying to stop a civil lawsuit against his multibillion-dollar social media company by arguing that he should be immune from civil litigation filed in state court while he serves as president.",
      "Trump and his co-defendants -- including FBI director nominee Kash Patel and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino -- asked a Delaware judge to either issue a four-year delay of the case or dismiss a lawsuit filed by Trump Media & Technology Group co-founders Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss, who alleged that Trump and company executives orchestrated a scheme to prevent them from getting their full stake in the company after it went public.",
      "Facing an \"unprecedented\" number of civil lawsuits, Trump argued that having to fend off the litigation would be a \"distraction\" from his presidential duties and \"interfere substantially\" with the function of the executive branch.",
      "\"Without the protections of temporary Presidential immunity, the President will be forced to defend against these cases -- and the many more that are sure to arise during his second term -- all to the detriment of his office and the American people he serves,\" attorneys John Reed and Theodore Kittila wrote in a filing on Friday in Delaware Chancery Court.",
      "In December, Delaware Chancery Court Judge Morgan Zurn agreed to temporarily pause the claim so Trump could make his immunity argument, though she noted that Trump \"is not presently deemed to be immune\" from the civil case. Lawyers for Trump Media and the president asked the court to establish a \"brightline deferral rule\" to delay any civil litigation Trump faces in state court by four years.",
      "\"State courts across the country are being called upon to sit in judgment of the sitting President, to tax his time, and to second-guess his priorities. That state of affairs -- President Jefferson's nightmare -- dishonors the Presidency and debases the state courts that purport to control his actions,\" the filing said.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump was sued at least 10 times, and he returned to the presidency with at least 14 lawsuits pending, including multiple suits related to his social media company. Trump placed his stake in the company -- 14,750,000 shares worth more than $3 billion -- into a trust controlled by his sons before entering office this month.",
      "If successful, Trump's claim of \"temporary presidential immunity\" could provide the president an additional layer of legal protection, having already entered office with newly broadened presidential power and protection from criminal liability following the Supreme Court's ruling last year on presidential immunity.",
      "Defense lawyers, in Friday's filing, claimed without evidence that Trump's \"billionaire adversaries\" are funding a wave of litigation \"to destroy the president.\"",
      "\"The President has already been sued more than all his predecessors combined, yet his rivals promise that there is still more to come,\" the lawsuit said. \"That swell of litigation will pose an even greater threat to the operations of the Executive Branch and the standing of state courts that purport to sit in judgment of his conduct.\"",
      "While the Supreme Court established in Clinton v. Jones that a president does not have immunity from civil lawsuits related to personal conduct, lawyers for Trump Media argued that the decision only applies to cases in federal court. Though the Trump Media lawsuit does not center on official acts, Trump argued that the burden of defending himself would intrude on his official duties, citing an example of how President Bill Clinton consulted his personal attorney three times on the same day he was deliberating whether to go to war with Iraq.",
      "\"With the benefits of hindsight and lived experience, it now is clear that state civil litigation against the President causes real 'diversion' and 'harassment' of the Presidency, sufficient to interfere substantially with the operations of the Executive Branch,\" the filing said.",
      "The defense lawyers claimed that the lawsuit would occupy Trump's limited \"energies and attention,\" which is already strained by the demands of the presidency.",
      "\"During his first term, President Trump ... slept just four to five hours per night -- because the burdens of the Presidency dwarfed even his responsibilities as a global business leader,\" the filing said.",
      "In a separate filing on Friday, Trump's personal lawyers told the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that the president should be immune from any civil claims related to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack because he was acting in his official capacity as president when he sought to challenge the results of the 2020 election.",
      "When reached for comment, regarding the Trump Media lawsuit, Richie Jones, an attorney for Moss and Litinsky, provided a quote by former President Theodore Roosevelt, saying it was \"the best we can do in terms of comment.\"",
      "\"No man is above the law, and no man is below it. Nor do we ask any man's permission when we require him to obey it,\" Jones wrote.",

    "summary": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's decision to join President Trump's \"Stargate\" AI initiative marks a stark reversal for the tech CEO, who previously was a vocal critic of Trump.",
    "story": [
      "\"Trump represents an unprecedented threat to America,\" Altman wrote in 2016.",
      "The day after President Donald Trump returned to office, Sam Altman, the CEO of tech giant OpenAI, stood behind the presidential seal at the White House and praised the newly sworn-in president for the $500 billion \"Stargate\" initiative he was joining to build an artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States.",
      "Altman said it wouldn't have been possible without Trump.",
      "\"For AGI [artificial general intelligence] to get built here, to create hundreds of thousands of jobs, to create a new industry centered here, we wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr. President, and I'm thrilled that we get to,\" Altman said as he and other industry leaders smiled for photos in the Roosevelt Room.",
      "The chummy announcement represented a stark reversal for Altman, who -- in the early days of Trump's first term -- emerged as one of Silicon Valley's first and most vocal critics of the president.",
      "From 2016 through 2022, Altman repeatedly warned about what he saw as the dangers posed by Trump's leadership and his policies. During the 2016 campaign, he compared Trump to Hitler in 1930s Germany, and he called on other tech companies to stand against Trump in the early days of the new administration. He donated hundreds of thousands to Democratic causes and candidates, including $200,000 to help reelect President Joe Biden in 2024.",
      "After Trump announced the \"Stargate\" deal, the OpenAI CEO appeared to address his reversal in a post on X, writing that \"watching [Trump] more carefully recently has really changed my perspective on him,\" and adding, \"I'm not going to agree with him on everything, but I think he will be incredible for the country in many ways!\"",
      "Other tech leaders have shifted their stance on Trump in recent years, even more so since his 2024 election win.",
      "Earlier this month, Mark Zuckerberg's Meta announced the end of its fact-checking program and eased restrictions on discussions about topics such as immigration and gender identity, following longstanding criticism from President Trump and his allies.",
      "Altman's public opposition to Trump began during the 2016 presidential campaign when, in October of that year, Altman made his first-ever presidential endorsement by backing Hillary Clinton.",
      "\"I am endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. I've never endorsed a presidential candidate before, but I'm making an exception this year, because this election is exceptional,\" Altman wrote in a blog post on Oct. 16, 2016, titled \"The 2016 Election.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump represents an unprecedented threat to America, and voting for Hillary is the best way to defend our country against it,\" Altman wrote.",
      "Months earlier, in the heat of the presidential campaign, Altman had published a scathing critique of Trump, writing, \"He is irresponsible in the way dictators are.\"",
      "\"To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it's chilling to watch Trump in action,\" Altman wrote in June 2016. \"Though I know intellectually it's easy in hard economic times to rile people up with a hatred of outsiders, it's still surprising to watch this happen right in front of us.\"",
      "\"Hitler taught us about the Big Lie -- the lie so big, and so often repeated, that people end up believing it,\" Altman wrote. \"Trump's Big Lie is hiding in plain sight. His Big Lie is that he's going to Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders.\"",
      "After Trump's victory, Altman called on his fellow tech leaders to \"take a stand\" against the new Trump administration in the wake of Trump's executive order known as the so-called Muslim ban, which Trump called \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\"",
      "Altman called the 2017 order \"a breach of America's contract with all the immigrants in the nation.\" The order spurred nationwide protests and legal challenges before being modified and then overturned by President Biden in 2021.",
      "He urged the tech industry to take action, writing on his personal blog, \"The tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally.\"",
      "He added that employees at tech companies \"should push their companies to figure out what actions they can take.\"",
      "\"It would be particularly embarrassing for us to fall for this -- we are a nation of immigrants, and we know that immigrants built this country (and Trump, of course, is the grandson of immigrants and married to an immigrant),\" Altman wrote.",
      "Altman himself took action by launching a website called \"Track Trump,\" which monitored Trump's fulfillment of his 2016 campaign promises over his first 100 days in office. He shared the website in a February 2017 tweet in which he said, \"For all the noise, Trump hasn't actually done very much yet.\"",
      "Altman's public criticism continued throughout Trump's first presidency. In a March 2017 tweet, Altman posted, \"I think Trump is terrible and few things would make me happier than him not being president.\"",
      "\"If you elect a reality TV star as President, you can't be surprised when you get a reality TV show,\" Altman wrote in July 2017.",
      "At a \"Talks with Google\" event in October 2017, Altman defended his outspoken criticism of Trump. Acknowledging that \"if you \"piss off the president, he might do bad things to you,\" Altman nevertheless said that \"when the future of the republic is at risk, the duty to the country and our values transcends the duty to your particular company and your stock price.\"",
      "\"I think I started that a little bit earlier than other people, but at this point I am in really good company,\" Altman added.",
      "Later, in the wake of Trump's 2020 election loss, Altman praised LinkedIn chairman and Democratic supporter Reid Hoffman, writing on Twitter, \"Very few people realize just how much @reidhoffman did and spent to stop Trump from getting re-elected -- it seems reasonably likely to me that Trump would still be in office without his efforts. Thank you, Reid!\"",
      "In recent years, Altman has himself contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes, including giving $200,000 in 2023 to the Biden Victory Fund, the joint fundraising committee that sought to reelect Joe Biden in 2024, according to federal election commission records reviewed by ABC News.",
      "Early in the 2020 election cycle, he contributed to a slew of Democratic primary presidential contenders, including to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, then-Sen. Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang, then later gave $100,000 to the Biden Victory Fund in the final weeks of the 2020 campaign.",
      "He also gave $100,000 each to the pro-Democratic super PACs American Bridge PAC and Senate Majority PAC.",
      "He wasn't an active political contributor during the 2016 election cycle, but gave a total of $1,500 to the Obama campaign in 2008 and 2012.",
      "Although Altman has almost exclusively donated to Democrats, he has also donated to a handful of Republicans, including California Reps. Darrell Issa and Jay Obernolte, Rep. John Curtis of Utah, and Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee.",

      "Educators, students and advocates across the Florida higher education system spoke out Monday against the recent removal by the state of hundreds of general education courses that touch on race, gender, and sexual orientation, calling the restrictions \"censorship\" during a webinar hosted by the United Faculty of Florida union.",
      "\"I chose to pursue a career in education to engage students in critical thinking, adaptability and global competence -- skills that are essential to success and societal contribution,\" said Jeniah Jones, a Florida State College at Jacksonville professor. \"Restrictions on diversity, equity and inclusion in the curriculum ... undermine this mission by narrowing students' understanding of the world and their role in it.\"",
      "Educators also argue that limiting general education options may also make it harder for students to fulfill their general education requirements.",
      "A slate of directives and policy changes from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the State University System of Florida's Board of Governors in recent years has changed the landscape around what colleges and universities can say about race, politics, gender and sexual orientation.",
      "DeSantis signed SB 266 in 2023, which prohibits universities from expending state or federal funds to promote, support, or maintain any programs or campus activities that relate to diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "DeSantis touted the legislation at the time, saying in a statement: \u201cFlorida has ranked No. 1 in higher education for seven years in a row, and by signing this legislation we are ensuring that Florida\u2019s institutions encourage diversity of thought, civil discourse and the pursuit of truth for generations to come.\"",
      "SB 266 amended a state statute requiring universities to go through an intensified review process to ensure that their general education course offerings are in compliance with the restrictions.",
      "Schools are unable to offer classes that include \"identity politics\" or that are \"based on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, and privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States and were created to maintain social, political and economic inequities,\" according to the Florida statute.",
      "At Florida State University, at least 432 courses from the college's general education curriculum were removed in part because of the rules, according to meeting minutes from the Board of Trustees.",
      "ABC affiliate First Coast News reported in November 2024 that University of North Florida removed 67 courses from the university's list of general education options.",
      "FSU told ABC News that the courses would be offered as electives instead of being able to fulfill general education requirements. UNF told First Coast News the same, that the courses will still be offered and available as electives.",
      "The state university system's Board of Governors also later restricted state funding toward diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, including \"political or social activism.\"",
      "Florida Commissioner of Education Manny Diaz, Jr. had applauded the move: \u201cHigher education must return to its essential foundations of academic integrity and the pursuit of knowledge instead of being corrupted by destructive ideologies.\"",
      "Marsilla Gray, a University of South Florida Ph.D. student and graduate assistant, said that professors are losing the freedom to discuss \"not only the latest research in a deep and unbiased manner, but also the ability to connect how these findings relate to our society as a whole\" based on these changes.",
      "\"It directly impacts student preparedness for both young scientists who want to go on to careers as researchers, physicians and educators, but also for non-STEM majors, for whom their few natural science Gen-Eds may be their only exposure to critically evaluating scientific statements and tying that to what they learn in their social science and humanities courses,\" she said on the Monday call.",
      "Robert Cassanello, a University of Central Florida history professor, said the restrictions are reminiscent of past pressures from political groups -- including religious prohibitions on teachings of evolution or anthropology as well as Cold War-era prohibitions on the discussion of communism or socialism.",
      "\"When the legislature has tried to interfere with curriculum, it never produced good outcomes,\" said Cassanello, in the press call.",
      "Leah Sauceda, a Florida State University student, said a general education requirement on Latin American history led her to seek a history degree as well as an international affairs major.",
      "\"My classes helped me realize the study of history isn't about the past, as contradictory as that sounds, but rather it is a tool to understand how the past is inextricably linked to the present and all possible futures,\" she said on the Monday call. \"History helps us understand the world and our place in it. It is heartbreaking to think that the same transformative opportunity I had can be taken away from future students because the Board of Governors would rather us ignore history than learn from it.\"",
      "The calls against DEI removals in higher education come as President Donald Trump implements anti-DEI restrictions on a federal level via several executive orders.",

    "summary": "The tallest building in Havana is impossible to miss",
    "story": [
      "The tallest building in Havana is impossible to miss",
      "HAVANA -- It\u2019s impossible to miss. The huge rectangular mass of concrete and glass \u2014 the tallest building in Havana \u2014 dominates the city skyline, towering 150 meters (490 feet) above colonial homes with its 542 luxury rooms and majestic views of the city and the sea.",
      "The Selection La Habana hotel, managed by Spanish chain Iberostar, has yet to be inaugurated but it is already the target of criticism \u2014 and not only for its unusual shape. Cubans are questioning the government\u2019s allocation of millions of dollars towards luxury tourism while the island grapples with a severe economic crisis and tourism numbers plummet to historic lows.",
      "\u201cAll that money could have been spent to build hospitals and schools,\u201d lamented Susel Borges, a 26-year-old artisan, as she looked up to the towering edifice, known to locals as the \u201cK and 23 building\u201d because of its location.",
      "Located near the legendary Habana Libre hotel and the iconic Coppelia ice cream parlor, the new hotel is part of a government plan to build a dozen luxury establishments \u2014 mainly in Havana \u2014 that did not stop even during the COVID-19 pandemic and while existing luxury hotels remained largely unoccupied.",
      "For decades, tourism drove the Cuban economy, generating annual revenues of up to $3 billion. But in December, Cuban authorities said only 2.2 million tourists visited the island in 2024, a decrease of roughly 200,000 from 2023 and significantly lower than the 4.2 million tourists who visited in 2019.",
      "The government attributes the decline in tourism to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors including supply shortages, a severe energy crisis causing massive blackouts and a lack of personnel, due to emigration and low wages. Furthermore, the island is grappling with a surge in U.S. sanctions, including restrictions on travel by U.S. citizens, a ban on cruise ships and other measures specifically designed to stifle the growth of Cuba\u2019s tourism industry.",
      "\u201cTourism is gone,\u201d said Julio Garc\u00eda Campos, driver of a shiny red 1951 Pontiac with an original engine. \u201cTourists used to line up to get on one of these!\u201d he said, recalling a bygone era when the island was bustling with American and European travelers following a removal of sanctions by then-President Barack Obama.",
      "The new Selection La Habana, like all other hotels in Cuba, is state-owned and operates under GAESA, a conglomerate belonging to the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces that has often been criticized because of the opacity of its businesses. As a military-run operation, it is exempt from audits by the Comptroller General\u2019s Office and has not disclosed the amount it invested in the 40-story hotel.",
      "Cuban economist Pedro Monreal notes the \u201cincongruity\u201d of investing capital in the tourism sector when very little is being allocated to strategic areas such as agriculture.",
      "\"With food insecurity a concern, it\u2019s troubling that agricultural investment lags significantly behind tourism investment, remaining 11 times lower,\u201d Monreal noted last year on social media.",
      "Architects also expressed little enthusiasm for the new hotel, pointing at its disruptive appearance within the environment, its excessive height violating urban regulations and tall glass windows that are ill-suited for a tropical climate.",
      "\u201cThis building serves as a perfect example in our classes of what should not be done in terms of bioclimatic design,\u201d said Abel Tablada, an architect and university professor, adding it's \"unforgivable\" that the little money available to the Cuban state has been allocated to a building that does not add value to the city.",

      "Here's a look at how immigration policy has changed so far under Trump and what hasn't happened yet:",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it made an average of 710 immigration arrests daily from Thursday through Monday, up from a daily average of 311 in a 12-month period through September under President Joe Biden. If that rate holds, it would surpass ICE's previous high mark set in the Obama administration, when daily arrests averaged 636 in 2013.",
      "Numbers spiked starting Sunday and included highly publicized operations, including in Atlanta, Dallas and, most prominently, Chicago.",
      "The Trump administration has highlighted participation of other agencies in ICE operations, a departure from Biden. They include the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \u2014 all part of the Justice Department \u2014 and the Homeland Security Department's Customs and Border Protection, which includes the Border Patrol.",
      "Emile Bove, the acting deputy attorney general, observed arrests in Chicago on Sunday in a sign of the Justice Department's growing involvement.",
      "Trump expanded arrest priorities to anyone in the country illegally, not just people with criminal convictions, public safety or national security threats and migrants stopped at the border. Still, some said it was business as usual for ICE \u2014 at least so far.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing unique about it,\u201d said Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge and a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a research and advocacy group that favors immigration restrictions.",
      "He anticipates more enforcement in next few weeks and believes Congress will approve funding for up to 80,000 beds, about double the current level. ICE needs the space to hold people while any legal proceedings play out and while it arranges deportations.",
      "ICE hasn't said how many people it has deported since Trump took office gain, but the administration has highlighted removal flights, including the use of military planes.",
      "Under Biden, ICE deported more than 270,000 people in a 12-month period that ended in September. That was the highest annual tally in a decade, helped by an increase in deportation flights. The Biden administration did not use military planes.",
      "In an episode that may signal more hardball diplomacy with governments that resist or refuse to take back their citizens, Trump said Sunday that he would raise tariffs 25% on Colombia after President Gustavo Petro refused to let two military planes land with deportees. Trump put the tariffs measures on hold after Petro backed down.",
      "A C-27 military transport plane landed Monday in Guatemala, with 80 deportees in shackles and handcuffs. \u201cIt\u2019s my first attempt of the year and I don\u2019t know if I will try again because it\u2019s hard,\u201d said Jacobo Due\u00f1as, 38, who was arrested Friday on the Texas border.",
      "The Trump administration made it easier for ICE to deport people without appearing before an immigration judge by expanding \u201cexpedited removal\u201d authority nationwide for anyone in the country up to two years. The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging the fast-track deportations in court.",
      "The administration ended a policy to avoid arrests at \u201csensitive locations,\u201d including schools, hospitals and places of worship. It said it may deport people who entered the country legally on parole, a presidential authority that Biden used more than any president.",
      "It also threatened to punish \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.",
      "Trump ended use of a border app to allow migrants to enter the country on two-year permits with eligibility to work, canceling tens of thousands of appointments into early February for people stranded in Mexico. Nearly 1 million people entered the U.S. at land crossings with Mexico by using the CBP One app.",
      "Trump also ended a policy that allowed more than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to fly to the country on two-year permits if they had a financial sponsor.",
      "Other actions will time to play out. Trump secured Mexico's approval to reinstate a hallmark policy of his first term, \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d which requires asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court.",
      "The Pentagon began deploying 1,500 active-duty troops to the border last week but it was unclear if they will break from supporting roles they have played under presidents since George W. Bush, including ground and aerial surveillance, building barriers and repairing vehicles.",
      "An 1878 law prohibits military involvement in civilian law enforcement, but Trump and his aides have signaled he may invoke wartime powers. Trump said in his order that the Defense Department can assist with detention and transportation.",
      "Trump stopped resettling refugees who are vetted abroad before entering the United States until further review, a program that he largely dismantled in his first term and was resurrected under Biden. Groups that provide temporary housing, job training and other support said the State Department told them Friday to stop work immediately.",
      "The Justice Department also told legal aid groups to stop work on federal programs that help people in immigration courts and detention centers navigate complex laws.",
      "Trump said he was ending automatic citizenship for children born on U.S. soil, a precedent established by constitutional amendment in 1868. A federal judge in Seattle has put it on hold.",

      "The vote came a week after Trump, on his first day in office, signed an executive order calling for the name to revert to Mount McKinley. Through his action, the president revived an idea he had floated years earlier \u2014 one the state's Republican U.S. senators and many Alaskans have opposed.",
      "Monday's vote was 28-10, though notice of reconsideration was given, meaning the resolution could be voted on again before being sent to the Senate.",
      "The Alaska House is led by a majority coalition that is composed largely of Democrats but also includes independents and two Republicans. The resolution came from Rep. Maxine Dibert, a Democrat who is Koyukon Athabascan. She noted that Denali is a Koyukon Athabascan word meaning \u201cthe high one,\" but said Denali is not just a name.",
      "\u201cIt's a symbol of history. It's a symbol of culture and a symbol of respect,\u201d Dibert said.",
      "Minority Republicans sought unsuccessfully to amend the resolution to add language expressing \u201cgratitude\u201d to Trump for a separate order aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state. Some of them said that approach seemed appropriate, given this will likely be the first formal message the Legislature sends to the Trump administration.",
      "Rep.

      "DORAL, Fla. -- President Donald Trump regaled House Republicans on Monday with a rhetorical highlight reel from his first week in office, and he urged them to support his immigration crackdown and border security proposals.",
      "\u201cWe have no apologies and we\u2019re moving very fast,\" Trump said.",
      "He said that \u201cI really focus on the border more than anything else,\" downplaying the importance of inflation, an issue that fueled his candidacy last year but one that he has less control over as president.",
      "Speaking at House Republicans' annual policy retreat, Trump made clear his political ambitions as he rallied lawmakers to advance their conservative agenda.",
      "\u201cWe're forging a new political majority that's shattering and replacing Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal coalition, which dominated American politics for over 100 years,\" he said.",
      "The conference is being held at Trump National Doral Miami, a posh resort with four golf courses owned by the billionaire president. Although Republicans are euphoric over election victories that have given them total control in Washington, they're also facing difficult negotiations in the coming weeks and months.",
      "They need to find consensus on a spending bill before a March 14 deadline, when funding for the federal government expires.",
      "In addition, Republicans are working on a budget blueprint that would set the stage for their broader plans, including tax cuts, fossil fuel development and border security. With thin majorities in the House and Senate, they will need near-unanimity to pass their proposals without Democratic support.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, set the first week of February for the House Budget Committee to pass the blueprint that is key to the whole process.",
      "\u201cThat will be where the lion's share of these campaign promises we made are fulfilled,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd that's what all the hard work here is, in the room with all of us negotiating and coming to consensus.\u201d",

      "Johnson is trying to lump many of the Republican priorities into one massive catch-all bill that Senate Democrats cannot filibuster, but many Republican senators think it would be better to do two bills \u2014 the first focused on border security and defense, and the second on extending and expanding upon the tax cuts passed in Trump's first term.",

      "Republicans are also eyeing potential changes to key safety net programs, such as work requirements for those participating in Medicaid, to help offset the cost of enacting their priorities. Trump has pushed expensive ideas like exempting tipped wages and Social Security checks from income taxes.",
      "House Republicans said they expect more specifics to be announced after the retreat in Doral. Until then, they were highlighting Trump's first week in office, particularly reveling in the showdown that Trump had with Colombia this past weekend over accepting flights of deported migrants from the U.S.",

      "Republicans are warning that if Congress does not act quickly to extend tax relief, capital will remain on the sidelines and families next year would see child tax credits and a guaranteed tax deduction greatly reduced, upping their federal tax bill.",
      "Trump and Republican leaders are also going to have to find a way to extend the nation's debt limit. The limit must be raised by Congress, and failure to do so risks the federal government defaulting on its debt and unable to pay all its bills.",

      "Wisconsin is the only state where governors can partially veto spending bills by striking words, numbers and punctuation to create new meaning or spending amounts. In most states, governors can only eliminate or reduce spending amounts.",
      "And while the Wisconsin governor's veto power has been reduced over the past four decades, it is still considered the strongest in the country. The issue has crossed party lines, with Republicans and Democrats pushing at different times for more limitations on the governor\u2019s veto depending on which party was wielding the power.",
      "Republican state lawmakers on Monday took the latest swing at reducing the veto powers, proposing a constitutional amendment that would eliminate a governor's powers to delete words and rework sentences in bills that spend taxpayer money.",
      "Under the proposal, the governor could only veto entire sections from spending bills instead of individual words.",
      "The partial veto as used by governors currently has turned them into a \u201csuper lawmaker,\u201d according to Republican Sens. Julian Bradley and Cory Tomcyzk and Republican state Rep. Scott Allen. They circulated the proposal for cosponsors Monday.",
      "The idea would have to pass two consecutive legislative sessions and be approved by voters before taking effect. The soonest that could happen is 2027. The Legislature is controlled by Republicans this session, but the 2026 election will determine who will have power starting in 2027.",
      "The governor could not veto the proposal.",

Five amendments were put on the ballot last year and a sixth which would add the state's voter ID law to the constitution is up for voter approval on April 1.",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s partial veto power was created by a 1930 constitutional amendment, but it\u2019s been weakened. Voters adopted constitutional amendments in 1990 and 2008 that removed the ability to strike individual letters to make new words \u2014 the \u201cVanna White\u201d veto \u2014 and the power to eliminate words and numbers in two or more sentences to create a new sentence \u2014 the \u201cFrankenstein\u201d veto.",
      "There is a pending case before the Wisconsin Supreme Court challenging a partial veto Evers made in 2023 that attempts to lock in a school funding increase for 400 years. Evers struck digits to create a new ending year for the increases, 2425.",
      "The Supreme Court is weighing whether to declare that the state constitution forbids the governor from striking digits to create a new year or to remove language to create a longer duration than the one approved by the Legislature."

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to revise the Pentagon\u2019s policy on transgender troops, likely setting in motion a future ban on their military service.",
      "He also ordered troops to be reinstated who had left voluntarily or been booted for refusing COVID-19 vaccines, outlined new rollbacks in diversity programs and provided for the deployment of a space-based missile defense shield for the U.S. \u2014 all on Hegseth 's first day.",
      "Trump and Hegseth had described parts of the anticipated orders throughout the day, but the exact language did not drop until late Monday.",
      "A transgender ban had been widely expected, and Trump's order largely sets the stage for a future ban \u2014 but directs Hegseth to come up with how that would be implemented in policy.",
      "In his order, Trump claimed that service by troops who identify as a gender other than their biological one \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life\u201d and is harmful to military readiness, requiring a revised policy to address the matter.",
      "Trump had tried to ban transgender troops during his first term, but it was tangled up in the courts for years before being overturned by then-President Joe Biden shortly after he took office.",
      "Two groups, Lambda Legal and Human Rights Campaign, which represented transgender troops the first time, vowed to fight again.",
      "\u201cWe have been here before and seven years ago were able to successfully block the earlier administration\u2019s effort,\u201d Lambda Legal attorney Sasha Buchert said. \u201cNot only is such a move cruel, it compromises the safety and security of our country and is particularly dangerous and wrong. As we promised then, so do we now: we will sue.\u201d",
      "During his first presidency, Trump established U.S. Space Command and the U.S. Space Force, which just marked its fifth birthday. Space continues to be a priority for the president, who has now directed the Pentagon to begin to develop the capability to shoot down missiles from space.",
      "For years, the U.S. has cautioned that China, Russia and others were weaponizing space. It has at times declassified information about both countries' efforts to create offensive weapons to disable critical U.S. satellites, including the capability to move satellites from orbit, temporarily blind them or potentially even destroy them.",
      "The Space Force is building a low-orbit ring of redundant satellites that can more quickly track and detect potential missile launches.",
      "But establishing a way to shoot missiles down from space is something the U.S. has not pursued since President Ronald Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative \u2014 \u201cStar Wars\u201d as it was commonly known \u2014 in the 1980s. The system was never developed due to cost and technological limitations.",
      "In his order called \u201can Iron Dome for America,\u201d Trump called for a multilayer missile defense system capable of countering an array of threats to the U.S., to include development and deployment of space-based interceptors.",
      "At least 8,200 troops were forced out of the military in 2021 for refusing to obey a lawful order when they declined to get the vaccine. Notices advising them they could return were sent out in 2023, but just 113 have reenlisted.",
      "The reinstatement process for any who now want to return requires that they meet military entry standards. Trump and Hegseth have persistently stated that the military must not reduce standards.",
      "\u2033We will offer full reinstatement to any service member who was expelled from the armed forces due to the COVID vaccine mandate,\u201d Trump told a Republican crowd at the Trump National Doral Miami, a resort he owns. \u201cAnd we will restore them to their former rank with full pay. \u2033",
      "In addition to troops forced out for refusing the shot, the order extends the same offer to anyone who signs a sworn statement saying they left the service voluntarily to avoid the vaccine.",
      "The order isn\u2019t expected to have a major impact on the number of service members returning. But it could take a bite out of the budget if more do now, since it requires back pay.",
      "To return, all would have to meet weight, fitness, medical and other requirements, and they could be refused if they now have a criminal record or other disqualifying factor. Officers would have to get recommissioned, which is a simple appointment process.",
      "According to the services, 3,748 Marines were discharged, and 25 have opted to re-enlist; 1,903 Army soldiers were discharged, and 73 returned; 1,878 sailors were discharged and two returned; 671 airmen were discharged and 13 returned.",
      "The Pentagon made the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory in August 2021 for all service members, including the National Guard and Reserve. Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said getting the vaccine was critical to maintaining a healthy, ready force that could be prepared to defend the nation.",
      "The Pentagon formally dropped the mandate in January 2023.",
      "Defense officials said then that many troops appeared to use the vaccine mandate as a way to quickly and easily to get out of their service obligations.",
      "Trump also, as expected, issued a sweeping order to abolish all programs, initiatives and mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion across the Defense Department and the Coast Guard, which is governed by the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The order looks to scrub \u201cany vestiges\u201d of such initiatives that seek to \u201cpromote a race-based preferences system that subverts meritocracy, perpetuates unconstitutional discrimination, and promotes divisive concepts or gender ideology.\u201d",
      "It prohibits the departments from promoting or following \u201cun-American\u201d theories that suggest that America\u2019s founding documents are racist or sexist; that discuss gender ideology; and that promote \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d such as \u201crace or sex stereotyping.\u201d",
      "The order says the defense and homeland security secretaries must issue guidance to implement the order in 30 days. It calls for a review to find any instances of actions taken in pursuit of DEI, which will be due to the defense secretary in 90 days.",
      "The secretaries must submit a report to the White House in six months outlining their progress.",
      "The Pentagon had already been taking steps to comply with Trump\u2019s initial action ending DEI programs across the U.S. government, and it has had far-reaching consequences. Without clearer direction, agencies were taking a broad approach to removing any content that seemed to run afoul of Trump's ban.",
      "That temporarily included videos of the storied Tuskegee Airmen and World War II Women's Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs, which were part of DEI training courses for the Air Force's basic military training. Videos on both the Tuskegee Airmen and WASPs were removed as the courses were taken down last week, causing an uproar.",
      "WASPs were vital in ferrying warplanes for the military. The Tuskegee Airmen were the nation\u2019s first Black military pilots, serving in a segregated WWII unit, and their all-Black 332nd Fighter Group had one of the lowest loss records of all the bomber escorts in the war.",
      "On Sunday, the Air Force clarified that the DEI courses had been removed to be edited but that the Tuskegee Airmen and WASP content would continue to be taught.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Rain mostly moved out of Southern California on Monday after the first significant storm of the season brought weekend downpours that aided firefighters while causing ash and mud to flow across streets, but no significant problems were reported in areas scorched by wildfires.",
      "More than an inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain fell in many areas, loosening Los Angeles hillsides burned bare by the recent blaze near the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, where crews cleared inundated roadways including the famed Pacific Coast Highway.",
      "In neighboring Malibu, four schools were closed Monday \u201cdue to dangerous road conditions,\u201d the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District said in a statement.",

      "North of Los Angeles, snowy conditions late Sunday shut down the mountainous Tejon Pass section of Interstate 5, a key north-south artery for the state. It reopened Monday afternoon. The highway rises to more than 4,100 feet (1,250 meters) between LA and the San Joaquin Valley, making it susceptible to storm closures.",
      "Mountains across San Bernardino and Riverside counties were under a winter storm warning Monday and were forecast to get about a foot (0.30 meters) of snow from the storm. Chains were required for some vehicles heading to ski resorts in the Big Bear Lake area northeast of Los Angeles because of icy roads.",
      "Parts of San Diego County received more than an inch of rain, while other areas got less.",
      "The rain began Saturday after months of dry and often gusty weather that created dangerous fire conditions.",

      "The Palisades Fire, the largest of the blazes that destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 11 people, reached 94% containment Monday. The Eaton Fire, which broke out near Altadena and has killed at least 16 people, was 98% contained.",
      "The Hughes Fire, which ignited north of Los Angeles last week and caused evacuation orders or warnings for more than 50,000 people, was nearly contained.",

      "Los Angeles city and county officials last week expedited cleanup efforts and other measures aimed at mitigating the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants, and a White House statement on Friday said President Donald Trump has directed federal officials to help local authorities.

      "Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from Los Angeles, was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes charred by a huge wildfire. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died.",
      "The rain ended a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Most of Southern California is currently in \u201cextreme drought\u201d or \u201csevere drought,\u201d according to the U.S. Drought Monitor."

    "story": [
      "Current and former European and U.S. officials have raised concerns about some of President Donald Trump\u2019s picks for top intelligence posts",
      "LONDON -- As Russia moved closer to invading Ukraine nearly three years ago, the United States and its allies took the extraordinary step of declassifying and sharing intelligence to expose Moscow\u2019s plans.",
      "Information flew across the Atlantic from U.S. spy agencies to NATO and Western partners showing that Russia was poised to launch the biggest attack on a European country since World War II.",
      "It was designed to muster support for Kyiv, and on the strength of the U.S. warning, some nations sent weapons to Ukraine, which moved some equipment out of the range of Russian strikes.",
      "Now, officials are bracing for a potentially changed security landscape under President Donald Trump. He has criticized America's allies and lambasted its intelligence agencies. He's been accused of disregarding secrecy rules and hoarding classified documents.",
      "Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, has parroted Russian propaganda while his nominee to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, has promised changes that could significantly curtail the flow of intelligence to America's friends. Both are expected to face sharp questioning from lawmakers during confirmation hearings Thursday.",
      "The Associated Press spoke with 18 current and former senior European and U.S. officials who worked in NATO, defense, diplomacy or intelligence. Many raised questions and concerns about Trump's past relationship with America's spies and their ability to share information at a time of heightened terror threats and signs of greater cooperation between U.S. adversaries.",
      "The U.S. and its allies routinely share top-secret information, be it about potential terror threats, Chinese cyberattacks or Russian troop movements. America's closest intelligence partners are New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Britain, and it often shares with other nations or sometimes even adversaries when lives are at stake.",
      "In July, the U.S. helped foil a Russian plot to assassinate the head of a German arms manufacturer that produced weapons for Ukraine. In August, the CIA said it provided intelligence to Austrian authorities that allowed them to disrupt a plan, allegedly inspired by the Islamic State group, to attack a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna.",
      "Cooperation particularly between the U.S. and the U.K. is \u201cstrong and robust enough to withstand some turbulence at the political level,\u201d said Lord Peter Ricketts, former U.K. national security adviser and current chair of the European Affairs Committee of the upper chamber of the British Parliament.",
      "However, any strong intelligence relationship is underpinned by trust, and what if \u201ctrust isn\u2019t there?\u201d Ricketts said.",
      "There was some skepticism about U.S. intelligence ahead of the invasion of Ukraine due to the faulty American information that led to the invasion of Iraq in 2001, said Oana Lungescu, a fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London and formerly NATO's longest-serving spokesperson.",
      "But when combined with information from its security partners, America's \u201cremarkable intelligence\" enabled the NATO alliance to raise the alert about Russia, Lungescu said.",
      "European leaders are working to convince Trump's administration that threats on the continent also are relevant for the United States.",
      "There shouldn't be much debate, said former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Mike McFaul, who said there's a direct relationship between U.S. intelligence sharing and national security. He noted that U.S. authorities have warned of escalating terror threats.",
      "\u201cOne of our great advantages is that we have incredible intelligence capabilities and we have allies that we share that with \u2014 it\u2019s a force multiplier for us,\u201d said McFaul, who now teaches at Stanford University. \u201cWe\u2019ll lose that if we\u2019re no longer considered trustworthy.\u201d",
      "The Trump team has an \u201copen mind and is in a listening mode,\u201d Norway\u2019s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said, adding that was a good sign because \u201cwhen you come in with a new administration in a very eventful, rapidly changing environment, getting on the same footing is a challenge.\u201d",
      "Predicting Trump\u2019s moves, however, is difficult. He has criticized NATO allies for not spending enough on defense. He even suggested he would encourage Russia to invade countries that didn\u2019t pay what he thought they should. But he didn\u2019t follow through on the threat.",
      "\u201cLast time it didn\u2019t turn out so badly: He was going to throw NATO under the bus, but he didn't do that,\" former U.S. Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte said. \"The rhetoric turned out to be transactional.\u201d",
      "Spokespeople for the White House and Gabbard did not respond to questions about Trump and his nominees or how they planned to handle intelligence sharing with America\u2019s allies.",
      "NATO members have hiked their defense spending \u2014 as Trump has demanded \u2014 and the alliance is now bigger than before, with Sweden and Finland joining after Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThere is a big risk of continuing to take American support for European, NATO countries ... and defense of Ukraine for granted,\u201d said Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.",
      "But it would also be risky to assume \u201cthe U.S. is simply leaving.\u201d On that question, Kristersson said, \u201cthe jury is very much out.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s choice of Gabbard to oversee more than a dozen intelligence agencies has alarmed lawmakers from both parties and many current and former intelligence officials. Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who later became a Trump ally, met since-deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2017 in Damascus and has promoted Russian propaganda about its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "If confirmed, Gabbard would have the power to declassify information and direct some intelligence sharing with allies.",
      "A European intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said that while there is concern around some of Trump\u2019s nominations, there is \u201cno reason to think we can\u2019t trust them because of who is in power.\u201d",
      "The official suggested nominees like Gabbard and Patel \u201chaven\u2019t heard all the facts yet\u201d and could \u201cgrow and learn\u201d when presented with the full picture.",
      "With thousands of professionals working in a multitude of agencies, the day-to-day operations of America\u2019s spy services may look very similar under the Trump administration. And there are safeguards, current and former officials told the AP, that include agencies sharing intelligence but not sources.",
      "But those in top positions will have a huge impact if they lead to staff departures, curtail longstanding surveillance programs as Patel has suggested or politicize their offices in ways that can be exploited by Moscow and other adversaries.",
      "The task for Europe is to convince everybody to focus on Russia, \u201dthe real troublemaker,\u201d the intelligence official said.",
      "Alongside Gabbard, Patel has rattled intelligence insiders in the U.S. and elsewhere because he's criticized surveillance programs like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which U.S. authorities use to keep tabs on suspected spies and terrorists overseas.",
      "The United States shared intelligence gathered through that law with Russia when public safety was at stake, passing along a warning before a deadly concert attack in Moscow in March that killed 145 people. It is not clear if Moscow tried to act on the warning.",
      "The European Union must be realistic that \u201cif the U.S. is reducing its participation in Europe, European members have to be ready to fill any gap,\u201d said former Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, who has called for the 27-nation bloc to create its own intelligence agency.",
      "Many global tech and communication firms such as Google, Apple and Microsoft as well as Elon Musk\u2019s X are based in the U.S., giving American law enforcement and spy agencies an advantage over their foreign counterparts, which may lack the political or legal means to obtain information.",
      "Niinist\u00f6 hosted a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018, in which Trump openly questioned his own intelligence agencies\u2019 finding that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election to his benefit, restating Putin\u2019s claim that Moscow was not involved.",
      "Niinist\u00f6, whose country borders Russia, described his discussions with Trump while in office as clear, open and frank.",
      "\u201cI tried to tell him: \u2018We need you, but you need us, too,\u2019\u201d Niinist\u00f6 said.",

      "SPRINGFIELD, Ohio -- At the end of his Sunday service, the pastor of the First Haitian Evangelical Church of Springfield, Ohio, asked ushers and musicians to form a circle around him as he knelt in prayer, flanked by the flags of Haiti and the United States.",
      "Many had come to receive his blessing and hear his guidance on how to deal with federal agents in case of raids stemming from President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration. Other congregants stayed home out of fear and growing uncertainty.",
      "\u201cI asked God to protect my people,\u201d the Rev. Reginald Silencieux said after the service, reflecting on his final prayer. \u201cI prayed especially for the Haitian community, and I prayed for U.S.A. too, because Trump is our president. As a church, we have an obligation to pray for him because he\u2019s our political leader right now.\u201d",
      "Some of Springfield's estimated 15,000 Haitians are seeking solace and divine intervention in their churches or at shops that sell spiritual products. Community leaders say many are overwhelmed by fears Trump will end or let expire the Temporary Protected Status program that allows them to remain in the U.S. legally.",
      "\u201cThe community is panicking.\u201d said Viles Dorsainvil, the leader of Springfield's Haitian Community Help and Support Center. \u201cThey see the arrests on TV in other parts of the country and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe majority of immigrants in the U.S.A. are not criminals, and they\u2019re hard-working people,\u201d he added. \u201cAny administration with common sense would rather work with those kinds of immigrants than deport them.\u201d",
      "Last year, Trump falsely accused Haitians in Springfield of eating their neighbor\u2019s cats and dogs. The false rumors exacerbated fears about division and anti-immigrant sentiment in the mostly white, blue-collar city of about 59,000.",
      "In the weeks after his comments, schools, government buildings and the homes of elected officials were targeted with dozens of bomb threats.",
      "\u201cBefore, we had a different type of fear \u2014 it was a fear of retaliation, whether it was the far right, the Proud Boys,\u201d said Jacob Payen, a Haitian community leader and owner of Milokan Botanica, a religious shop that sells Haitian spiritual and natural healing products.",
      "\u201cNow, there\u2019s a fear of deportation. That keeps a lot of people from going out and has caused a lot of people to have left,\u201d he said, pointing to the usually busy commercial plaza where his business is located and that was now more quiet than usual.",
      "Between selling religious candles and spiritual ointments, Payne guided customers with immigration forms, employment authorization cards and questions on their TPS applications.",
      "Brutus Joseph, 50, who works installing solar panels, said he came to the botanica to find spiritual relief. But he also wanted to speak his mind.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel right at all. I have a lot in my chest,\u201d Joseph said in Creole through an interpreter. \u201cMy wife and I can\u2019t even sleep because we\u2019re so worried. We\u2019re law-abiding citizens \u2014 all we did is to be Haitian. We didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be treated like this by the (Trump) administration. I\u2019m praying to God that the president changes his mind.\u201d",
      "Joseph especially worries about the future for his five children, including one who is a senior in high school in Springfield and plans to attend college this year.",
      "\u201cIf I leave here, there\u2019s no future for my children. My children can get raped and killed if I go back, so I have everything to lose,\" he said, making an appeal to Trump as a fellow family man who is married to an immigrant.",
      "The Rev. Philomene Philostin, one of the pastors at the First Haitian Evangelical Church, bemoaned the lower-than-usual attendance at Sunday's service.",
      "\u201cThey don't have to be scared. They have to be alert,\" she said. \"They shouldn't be scared to the point where they don't come to church.\u201d",
      "The migration concerns of clergy and other community members in Springfield are shared by many faith leaders nationwide. In several cities, including New York, Philadelphia and Portland, Oregon, interfaith groups are discussing how to provide security and support to migrants in their communities, including those who are undocumented.",
      "During his first administration, Trump used bluntly vulgar language to question why the U.S. would accept immigrants from Haiti and \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa. His 2024 campaign focused heavily on illegal immigration, often referring in his speeches to crimes committed by migrants.",

      "Bove said he was in Chicago on Sunday morning and observed Department of Homeland Security agents, along with assisting federal agencies \u2014 including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives. He didn't say where the operations took place in the city or detail any arrests.",

      "Rain falling on Southern California is expected to aid firefighters mopping up multiple wildfires",
      "LOS ANGELES -- After weeks of windy and dry weather, rain has fallen in parched Southern California and is expected to aid firefighters who are mopping up multiple wildfires. But potentially heavy downpours on charred hillsides could bring new troubles such as toxic ash runoff.",
      "Los Angeles County crews spent much of the past week removing vegetation, shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires, which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds Jan. 7.",
      "Most of the region was forecast to get around an inch (about 2.5 centimeters) of precipitation over several days, but \u201cthe threat is high enough to prepare for the worst-case scenario\u201d of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills, the National Weather Service said on social media.",
      "\u201cSo the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area,\u201d weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said. \u201cThat could be enough to create debris flows.\u201d",
      "Rainfall that began late Saturday was expected to increase Sunday and possibly last into early Tuesday, forecasters said. Flood watches were issued for some burn areas, while snow was likely in the mountains.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order last week to expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.",
      "Fire crews filled sandbags for communities, while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins.",
      "Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up.",
      "Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from LA, was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died.",
      "While the impending wet weather ended weeks of dangerous gusts and reduced humidity, several wildfires were still burning Saturday across Southern California. Those included the Palisades and Eaton fires, which killed at least 28 people and destroyed more than 14,000 structures. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81% on Saturday and the Eaton Fire was 95% contained.",
      "In northern Los Angeles County, firefighters made significant progress against the Hughes Fire, which prompted evacuations for tens of thousands of people when it erupted on Wednesday in mountains near Lake Castaic.",
      "In San Diego County, there was still little containment of the Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The rain was expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year, which began Oct. 1, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.",
      "Most of Southern California is currently in \u201cextreme drought\u201d or \u201csevere drought,\u201d according to the U.S. Drought Monitor."

      "The incident highlighted serious quality control failings at the company \u2013 and at its main supplier, Spirit Aerosystems. It also reignited concerns about Boeing's attitude towards safety.",

    "story": [
      "Many of us have prepared instructions and critical information for our family in the event of our sudden demise. For Daniel Stenberg, that includes passwords for his Google and GitHub accounts.",
      "That\u2019s because he\u2019s the founder of curl, an open source internet transfer engine that has been downloaded billions of times and is used to transfer data to and from computer servers.",
      "It was first released by Mr Stenberg in 1996 and is now used by millions ever day.",
      "It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away.",
      "\u201cI just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,\u201d Mr Stenberg says.",
      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work afterall.",
      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",
      "Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there\u2019s \u201cprobably less visceral enthusiasm\u201d for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.",
      "And, he continues, \u201cI've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, he says, there is a \u201cjoy, especially for a young person\u201d in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.",

      "Defined benefit pensions, sometimes known as a final salary scheme, are directly linked to a worker's salary and length of service.",

      "'Bit of a damp squib'",
      "Some pensions experts have warned there are risks around redeploying surplus funds, but The Pensions Regulator (TPR) has expressed its support for the government's plans.",
      "\"Where schemes are fully funded and there are protections in place for members, we support efforts to help trustees and employers consider how to safely release surplus if it can improve member benefits or unlock investment in the wider economy,\" said Nausicaa Delfas, chief executive of TPR.",
      "Many of these pension schemes are closed, so are invested relatively safely in order to ensure they meet their obligations to members, when no extra contributions are coming in.",
      "Pension scheme trustees would need to agree that releasing money will not put members' pensions at danger.",
      "There is no guarantee that companies would use the money to invest - a move that would require confidence in the wider outlook. That would need to happen at scale for economic growth to improve.",
      "Workers might also want the surplus to be used to improve the pension offer made to all staff - including those on more common defined contribution, rather than defined benefit, pensions.",
      "Independent pension consultant John Ralfe said the chancellor was looking for a \"quick win\" in her quest for growth, but doubted the latest proposed reforms would deliver it.",
      "\"The idea that there is a queue of companies waiting to do this is wishful thinking,\" he said, due to most firms looking to offload their pension liabilities altogether to specialist insurance companies.",
      "For those companies that do want to withdraw surpluses , they would need to agree changes with trustees, which would likely be \"long drawn-out process\",\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "It was Christmas 2011, a year after Roman Abramovich had taken delivery of his new superyacht, Eclipse. But it seemed the oligarch would not be using it over the festive period - records show it had been chartered by a company based in the British Virgin Islands.",
      "And yet photographs from Christmas Day that year show Mr Abramovich in the Caribbean sunshine, standing on the swim platform at the rear of the yacht, with Eclipse's large letter-E logo behind him.",
      "Charter records such as this were part of a decade-long scheme to mislead tax authorities, now uncovered in an investigation by the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.",
      "The scheme falsely presented the Russian oligarch's fleet of yachts as a commercial leasing operation, to dodge millions of euros in VAT on their purchase and running costs.",
      "\"There has been tax evasion,\" Italian tax lawyer and professor Tommaso Di Tanno told the BBC. \"This is criminal.\"",
      "In a statement, lawyers for Mr Abramovich - who now reportedly divides his time between Istanbul, Tel Aviv and the Russian resort of Sochi - said he had \"always obtained independent expert professional tax and legal advice\" and \"acted in accordance\" with it.",
      "The billionaire, who was sanctioned by the UK in March 2022 over his connection to Vladimir Putin's regime, bought five luxury yachts over the course of the 2000s that were involved in the tax scheme.",
      "Among them was the 115m (377ft) Pelorus, which he reportedly lent to Chelsea footballer John Terry for his honeymoon in 2007 - and Eclipse, which at 162.5m (533ft) was once the largest private yacht in the world and worth an estimated $700m (\u00a3559m).",
      "The scheme to dodge tax on the yachts - and other secrets of the sanctioned oligarch's corporate empire - is laid bare in over 400,000 files and 72,000 emails leaked from a Cypriot corporate service provider, MeritServus.",
      "They show how MeritServus administered the oligarch's businesses through a global network of companies owned by a series of trusts of which Mr Abramovich was the beneficiary.",
      "The BBC and its media partners, including the Guardian, have been reporting on the leaked files since 2023 as part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' Cyprus Confidential investigation. We previously revealed Mr Abramovich's financial links to one of Mr Putin's closest associates, accused of holding the president's wealth.",
      "The files reveal how Mr Abramovich's advisers helped him avoid paying huge tax bills on the yachts' running costs in EU waters by using companies to hire them out to himself or other companies he controlled.",
      "Documents show how the five yachts were leased to a company in Cyprus called Blue Ocean Yacht Management, which chartered them on to a handful of companies in the British Virgin Islands that appeared independent - but which were all in fact controlled by Mr Abramovich.",
      "'Aware of the risks'",
      "The scheme to dodge VAT in Cyprus was set out in a revealing 2005 memorandum on the proposed \"Operating Structure\" for the management of Mr Abramovich's yachts.",
      "\"We want to avoid paying VAT on the purchase price of the yachts and where possible to avoid paying VAT on goods and services provided to the yachts,\" wrote the memo's author, Jonathan Holloway, then a director of Blue Ocean.",
      "You can hear File on 4 Investigates: Abramovich, the Yachts and the Tax Dodge on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on Tuesday 28 January and at 11:00 on Wednesday 29 January - or on BBC Sounds",

      "Although Blue Ocean and the companies hiring the yachts were all owned by Mr Abramovich's trusts, they were intended to appear unconnected \"so that an investigator checking on our operation would see it as a legitimate structure\", Mr Holloway wrote in the memo he sent to some of Mr Abramovich's closest associates.",
      "Mr Holloway warned them they should be \"aware of the risks\". He wrote: \"We all have to recognise that a determined investigator could eventually discover this is an in-house structure with the possible consequences that would entail.\"",
      "Mr Holloway wrote that Blue Ocean, the companies to which it leased the yachts, and the ultimate \"customer\" should not have the same shareholders, directors or registered addresses, to avoid any \"common link\" that might arouse suspicion.",
      "As the memo noted, Mr Abramovich's lawyer had agreed to put the ownership of Blue Ocean into an entirely separate trust - apparently distancing it from the other companies.",
      "Sure enough, ownership of the yacht management company Blue Ocean was subsequently transferred from the oligarch's main trust to a new one, the Neptune Trust.",
      "'Hide the reality'",
      "The way Mr Abramovich's companies leased the yachts to each other, Prof Di Tanno told the BBC, was an \"artificial structure\" that evaded tax - a criminal offence.",
      "\"My conclusion is that in the case, there has been a tax evasion\u2026 because all the parties know exactly what to do in order to hide the reality,\" he said.",
      "Tax expert Rita de la Feria told the BBC she had seen in the yacht scheme \"indications\" that they \"may be misrepresenting information\".",
      "\"If that is the case, then we are now in the realm of evasion,\" she added.",
      "Mr Holloway, who stepped down as a director of Blue Ocean about 15 years ago, told the BBC that he \"joined Blue Ocean 20 years ago and was there for a relatively short period of time\".",
      "He said he had \"managed literally hundreds of vessels from many different locations around the world\". \"I can't be expected to remember the individual circumstances of every vessel I have ever managed,\" he said, adding that he \"used structures others in the industry were using\".",
      "Lawyers representing Mr Abramovich told the BBC he denied \"any allegation that he had any knowledge\" or was \"personally responsible\" or liable for \"any alleged deception of any government authority\" to evade tax.",
      "His lawyers said that just as Mr Abramovich sought professional legal and tax advice and acted on it, he expects that \"similar advice was sought at the relevant times by those with responsibility for the day-to-day running\" of the companies involved in the scheme.",
      "If this were a real superyacht leasing business, substantial profits might be expected. However Blue Ocean's accounts show that from 2005 to 2012, its expenses almost matched its income.",
      "This meant almost no corporation tax was due as the company's profits were tiny.",
      "A note from the Blue Ocean director suggests the close matching of expenses and income was no accident and the company would generate charters when the scheme needed to cover expenses.",
      "\"At the beginning of each week we will have a meeting in Blue Ocean where we will look at our current bank balances and our cash needs for the next 1~2 weeks [sic]. If we see a need for a cash injection we will raise an appropriate time charter and invoices,\" he wrote.",
      "There is also evidence in the leaked files that charter agreements were backdated. This includes a time charter agreement supposedly signed in July 2005 by Blue Ocean and another Abramovich company in the BVI called Eyke Services. However, records show Eyke Services did not exist at that point - it was not incorporated until a month later.",
      "In another case, a director of Blue Ocean requested the production of a backdated and signed time charter in order to obtain delivery of duty-free fuel for Mr Abramovich's 86m (282ft) yacht Ecstasea - which could accommodate 15 guests in eight suites - saving the billionaire $44,000 (\u00a335,000) in tax.",
      "In the documents, tax consultants from Deloitte in Cyprus wrote to Mr Holloway, the Blue Ocean director, saying if the ships were pleasure vessels, they would have to pay VAT. But if the vessels were classified as commercial, they would not.",
      "A leading superyacht lawyer Benjamin Maltby told the BBC the type of contracts used for many of Mr Abramovich's luxury yacht charters were actually designed for commercial ships carrying dry cargos such as grain or steel.",
      "This gives us more evidence that the whole commercial \"look\" of the operation was a sham.",
      "'Lawyers got onto it'",
      "Mr Abramovich's superyacht scheme came under legal scrutiny twice, with varying levels of success, the BBC and Bureau of Investigative Journalism has learned.",
      "Richard Bridge captained two of Mr Abramovich's yachts for almost six years from 2006 to 2012, including the Pelorus, and the giant Eclipse, the pride of Abramovich's fleet. A couple of years after he finished working for Mr Abramovich, the captain was stopped and questioned at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.",
      "Italian prosecutors had started proceedings against three of Mr Abramovich's captains - including Mr Bridge - for unpaid excise duties on refuelling and tax evasion.",
      "But Mr Bridge told the BBC he had contacted Blue Ocean and \"their lawyers got onto it\", telling him a few months later the case had been dropped.",
      "Italian court records seen by the BBC show proceedings were halted after the lawyers \"produced documentation\" proving Pelorus was \"entered in the registers as a commercial boat as it is used for commercial purposes or for hire\".",
      "Mr Bridge said he was unaware Mr Abramovich also controlled the companies that were chartering the yachts.",
      "In Cyprus, tax officials were separately investigating Blue Ocean over up to \u20ac17m (\u00a314.3m) in unpaid VAT, disputing the company's claim to be \"zero-rated\" for VAT because it was a commercial operation.",
      "Blue Ocean's lawyers said demands to provide evidence the vessels had been used commercially by the companies chartering them were \"unreasonable and oppressive\", but they had asked its clients anyway and received no response.",
      "We now know that Blue Ocean's clients were, of course, Mr Abramovich's other companies.",
      "According to an appeal judgement in 2018, VAT investigators found Blue Ocean had failed to present any evidence the companies chartering the yachts were \"engaged in economic activity\" and its claim that the boats were used for commercial purposes was rejected.",
      "In the end, Cyprus pursued Blue Ocean for the lower figure of \u20ac14m (\u00a311.8m).",
      "We do not know if the sum was paid - the company failed to attend its own appeal in March 2024 and was dissolved four months later.",

      "In recent years, it has become best known as the tech behind chatbots such as ChatGPT - and DeepSeek - also known as generative AI.",
      "These programs again learn from huge swathes of data, including online text and images, to be able to make new content.",
      "But these tools can create falsehoods and often repeat the biases contained within their training data.",
      "Millions of people use tools such as ChatGPT to help them with everyday tasks like writing emails, summarising text, and answering questions - and others even use them to help with basic coding and studying.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is the name of a free AI-powered chatbot, which looks, feels and works very much like ChatGPT.",
      "That means it's used for many of the same tasks, though exactly how well it works compared to its rivals is up for debate.",
      "It is reportedly as powerful as OpenAI's o1 model - released at the end of last year - in tasks including mathematics and coding.",
      "Like o1, R1 is a \"reasoning\" model. These models produce responses incrementally, simulating a process similar to how humans reason through problems or ideas. It uses less memory than its rivals, ultimately reducing the cost to perform tasks.",
      "Like many other Chinese AI models - Baidu's Ernie or Doubao by ByteDance - DeepSeek is trained to avoid politically sensitive questions.",
      "When the BBC asked the app what happened at Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989, DeepSeek did not give any details about the massacre, a taboo topic in China.",
      "It replied: \"I am sorry, I cannot answer that question. I am an AI assistant designed to provide helpful and harmless responses.\"",
      "Chinese government censorship is a huge challenge for its AI aspirations internationally. But DeepSeek's base model appears to have been trained via accurate sources while introducing a layer of censorship or withholding certain information via an additional safeguarding layer.",
      "Deepseek says it has been able to do this cheaply - researchers behind it claim it cost $6m (\u00a34.8m) to train, a fraction of the \"over $100m\" alluded to by OpenAI boss Sam Altman when discussing GPT-4.",
      "DeepSeek's founder reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, which have been banned from export to China since September 2022.",
      "Some experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to build such a powerful AI model, by pairing these chips with cheaper, less sophisticated ones.",
      "Who is behind DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek was founded in December 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, and released its first AI large language model the following year.",
      "Not much is known about Liang, who graduated from Zhejiang University with degrees in electronic information engineering and computer science. But he now finds himself in the international spotlight.",
      "He was recently seen at a meeting hosted by China's premier Li Qiang, reflecting DeepSeek's growing prominence in the AI industry.",
      "Unlike many American AI entrepreneurs who are from Silicon Valley, Mr Liang also has a background in finance.",
      "He is the CEO of a hedge fund called High-Flyer, which uses AI to analyse financial data to make investment decisons - what is called quantitative trading. In 2019 High-Flyer became the first quant hedge fund in China to raise over 100 billion yuan ($13m).",
      "In a speech he gave that year, Liang said, \"If the US can develop its quantitative trading sector, why not China?\"",
      "In a rare interview last year, he said China's AI sector \"cannot remain a follower forever\".",
      "He went on: \"Often, we say there's a one or two-year gap between Chinese and American AI, but the real gap is between originality and imitation. If this doesn't change, China will always be a follower.\"",
      "Asked why DeepSeek's model surprised so many in Silicon Valley, he said: \"Their surprise stems from seeing a Chinese company join their game as an innovator, not just a follower - which is what most Chinese firms are accustomed to.\"",
      "Australia's science minister has raised some doubts over the security of the app.",
      "\"There are a lot of questions that will need to be answered in time on quality, consumer preferences, data and privacy management,\" Ed Husic told ABC.",
      "\"I would be very careful about that. These type of issues need to be weighed up carefully.\"",
      "How are US companies hit?",
      "DeepSeek's achievements undercut the belief that bigger budgets and top-tier chips are the only ways of advancing AI, a prospect which has created uncertainty about the future of high-performance chips.",
      "\"DeepSeek has proven that cutting-edge AI models can be developed with limited compute resources,\" says Wei Sun, principal AI analyst at Counterpoint Research.",
      "\"In contrast, OpenAI, valued at $157 billion, faces scrutiny over its ability to maintain a dominant edge in innovation or justify its massive valuation and expenditures without delivering significant returns.\"",
      "The company's possibly lower costs roiled financial markets on 27 January, leading the tech-heavy Nasdaq to fall more than 3% in a broad sell-off that included chip makers and data centres around the world.",
      "Nvidia appears to have been hit the worst as its stock price plunged 17% over the course of the day.",
      "The chip maker had been the most valuable company in the world, when measured by market capitalisation, but fell to third place after Apple and Microsoft on Monday, when its market value shrank to $2.9tn from $3.5tn, Forbes reported.",
      "China is celebrating DeepSeek's impact",
      "DeepSeek's rise is a huge boost for the Chinese government, which has been seeking to build tech independent of the West.",
      "While the Communist Party is yet to comment, Chinese state media was eager to note that Silicon Valley and Wall Street giants were \"losing sleep\" over DeepSeek, which was \"overturning\" the US stock market.",
      "\"In China, DeepSeek's advances are being celebrated as a testament to the country's growing technological prowess and self-reliance,\" says Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "\"The company's success is seen as a validation of China's Innovation 2.0, a new era of homegrown technological leadership driven by a younger generation of entrepreneurs.\"",
      "But she also warned that this sentiment may also lead to \"tech isolationism\".",

    "story": [
      "This is a key week for the government and its pledge to grow the UK economy.",
      "On Wednesday, Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to announce plans for a third runway at Heathrow airport as part of measures to propel investment and kick some life into Britain's lacklustre performance.",
      "Growth, Reeves will reiterate, is the priority.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Last week, Friends of the Earth said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "But is expanding the country's biggest airport the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

      "DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot reportedly made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals, launched last week but has already become the most downloaded free app in the US.",
      "AI chip giant Nvidia and other tech firms connected to AI, including Microsoft and Google, saw their values tumble on Monday in the wake of DeepSeek's sudden rise.",
      "In a separate development, DeepSeek said on Monday it will temporarily limit registrations because of \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its software.",
      "What is DeepSeek and why did it cause tech stocks to drop?",
      "Is China's AI tool DeepSeek as good as it seems?",
      "The DeepSeek chatbot was reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its rivals, raising questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning.",

      "President Donald Trump, in one of his first announcements since returning to office, called it \"the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history\" that would help keep \"the future of technology\" in the US.",
      "DeepSeek is powered by the open source DeepSeek-V3 model, which its researchers claim was trained for around $6m  - significantly less than the billions spent by rivals.",
      "But this claim has been disputed by others in AI.",
      "The researchers say they use already existing technology, as well as open source code - software that can be used, modified or distributed by anybody free of charge.",
      "DeepSeek's emergence comes as the US is restricting the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China.",
      "To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology.",
      "This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before.",
      "It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry.",

      "At the time, the US was considered to have been caught off-guard by their rival's technological achievement.",
      "DeepSeek's sudden popularity has startled stock markets in Europe and the US.",

      "\"This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn't necessarily been forefront, so it's taken the market a little bit by surprise,\" said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index.",
      "\"So, if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that's going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they've already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure.\"",
      "Singapore-based technology equity adviser Vey-Sern Ling told the BBC it could \"potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain\".",
      "But Wall Street banking giant Citi cautioned that while DeepSeek could challenge the dominant positions of American companies such as OpenAI, issues faced by Chinese firms could hamper their development.",
      "\"We estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US access to more advanced chips is an advantage,\" analysts said in a report.",
      "Meanwhile, DeepSeek said on Monday it had been the victim of a cyberattack.",
      "\"Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Existing users can log in as usual. Thanks for your understanding and support.\"",
      "Who founded DeepSeek?",
      "The company was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, a city in southeastern China.",
      "The 40-year-old, an information and electronic engineering graduate, also founded the hedge fund that backed DeepSeek.",
      "He reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, now banned from export to China.",
      "Experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to launch DeepSeek, by pairing these chips with cheaper, lower-end ones that are still available to import.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has said he thinks the US will gain control of Greenland, underlining his persistent claim on the Arctic island, on one occasion pointing to \"economic security\" as the reason. While the autonomous Danish territory has been quick to say it isn't for sale, its vast and mostly untapped mineral resources are in great demand.",
      "Jagged grey peaks suddenly appear before us, as the motorboat navigates choppy coastal waters and dramatic fjords at Greenland's southern tip.",
      "\"Those very high pointy mountains, it's basically a gold belt,\" gestures Eldur Olafsson, the chief executive of mining company Amaroq Minerals.",
      "After sailing for two hours we stepped ashore at a remote valley beneath Nalunaq mountain, where the firm is drilling for gold.",
      "It's also scouring the surrounding mountain range and valleys, hunting for other valuable minerals, having snapped up exploration licences spanning over 10,000 sq km (3,861 sq miles).",
      "\"We're looking for copper, nickel, and rare earths,\" says the Icelandic boss. \"This is uncharted, and still has the potential to have multiple big deposits.\"",
      "The base camp is a cluster of mobile buildings and bright orange accommodation tents housing more than 100 staff, including Greenlanders, Australians, and British former coal miners. From there a road climbs up the valley, and we drive by car into the gold mine, following a dark tunnel upwards inside the mountain.",
      "\"See here!\" says Mr Olafsson pointing to a seam of white quartz and a thin dark line. \"Gold, gold, gold. All the way over. Isn't that extraordinary?\"",

      "The mine, which Amaroq bought in 2015, had operated for most of the preceding decade, but closed due to then falling gold prices, and high operating costs.",
      "Amaroq is confident that the mine will now be profitable. And it plans to ramp up production this year, where it has built a brand new processing plant to crush the ore and refine the precious metal into gold bars.",
      "\"We can either walk off site every month with a suitcase of gold, versus a 30,000 tonne ship [carrying the ore],\" explains Mr Olafsson.",
      "He says that Greenland presents an unrivalled opportunity because its huge mineral reserves are largely untouched.",
      "\"It can be the supplier of all the minerals the Western world will need for decades,\" adds Mr Olafsson. \"And that is a very unique position.\"",
      "Yet currently there are just two active mines on the entire island.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory that is part of Denmark, but controls its own natural resources.",
      "It's endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so-called rare earth elements, which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors. It also has large amounts of other key metals, such as lithium and cobalt.",
      "There is oil and gas too, but new drilling is banned, while deep-sea mining has also been ruled out.",
      "Christian Kjeldsen, director of Greenland's Business Association, says that the global \"geopolitical situation right now is driving interest in the world's biggest island\".",
      "He points to China having the world's largest reserves of rare earth metals, while the West wants to secure alternative supplies.",
      "\"You have a very strong China sitting very heavily on the critical raw materials,\" he says.",

      "Up to Greenland to decide its future, Danish PM tells Trump",
      "Trump ramps up threats to gain control of Greenland and Panama Canal",
      "That has fuelled a growing focus among Western nations to get access to Greenland's minerals. China has also been keen to get involved, but its presence is limited.",
      "Reuters recently reported that the US lobbied an Australian mining firm not to sell Greenland's biggest rare earth project to potential Chinese buyers.",
      "Greenland's Minister for Business, Trade and Raw Materials, Naaja Nathanielsen, says that interest in the territory's minerals has \"absolutely increased within the last five years or so\".",
      "She adds: \"We're used to being a hotspot for the climate crisis. We want to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Permits have now been given for 100 blocs across Greenland, where companies are searching for viable deposits. British, Canadian and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign licence holders, while Americans hold just one.",
      "But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines.",
      "Yet while Greenland may be sitting on mineral riches, any \"gold rush\" continues to be slow to materialise.",
      "The economy, which has an annual GDP of just over $3bn (\u00a32.4bn), is still driven by the public sector and fishing. And the territory also relies on an annual $600m subsidy from Denmark.",
      "Greenland's politicians hope that mining revenues will reduce reliance on the annual $600m subsidy from Denmark, and help boost independence efforts. But in the meantime Greenland is making more money from tourism.",
      "Officially mining is still important for independence, says Javier Arnaut, head of Arctic Social Sciences at Greenland University. \"But in practical terms, you can see that there are very few mining licenses awarded.\"",
      "Ms Nathanielsen concedes that while there are partnerships being developed with the US and EU, \"we still have not seen large amounts of money flowing into this sector\". She hopes that there will be another three to five mines operating within the next decade.",
      "However mining is not easy in Greenland because of its remote geography and weather. It's the world's largest island and 80% of it is covered by an ice sheet. It has rugged mountains and no roads between settlements.",
      "\"It's an arctic terrain,\" says Jakob Kl\u00f8ve Keiding, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which has mapped the territory's deposits. \"We have problems with harsh conditions in terms of the climate and limited infrastructure. So it's quite expensive to open a mine.\"",
      "Those high costs, coupled with low global metal prices, have held back investors.",
      "Others blame red tape for the sector's slow growth. The territory has strict environmental regulations and social impact requirements, and getting permits can take time.",
      "Ms Nathanielsen maintains that most communities do support mining, and that it boosts local economies. \"They [overseas miners] are shopping in the local shop. They're employing local employees. They're chartering a local boat or helicopter,\" she says.",
      "Yet in the south's biggest town, Qaqortoq, resident Heidi Mortensen M\u00f8ller is sceptical whether new mines will lead to employment for locals. \"When they say they're going to add jobs, who are they talking about?\"",
      "Jess Berthelsen, head of local labour union, SIK, says that many people think mining income \"will leave the country\", and not benefit Greenland. But he supports the growth of the sector. \"Greenland needs more income and to earn money from other ways than fishing.\"",
      "It's unclear how Trump's latest gambit on Greenland will play out. However, the territory's prime minister Mute Egede said earlier this month that \"we need to do business with the US\" and that it was \"doors open in terms of mining\".",
      "Mr Kjeldsen from the business association, hopes it will be bring \"much needed investment\" to the sector. \"On the other hand, if the uncertainty surrounding the signals from Trump drag on for a longer period, there is a risk that this might impact the investment environment negatively.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 02:26:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Maxime Chapoutier makes wines that combine French and Australian grapes, a strict no-no in the EU.",
    "story": [
      "Winemaker Maxime Chapoutier would be arrested if he tried to sell two of his newest wines in his native France.",
      "\"There would likely be outrage about these wines in France, and that would be a good thing,\" he says. \"Sometimes you need to be provocative to drive change.\"",
      "The two bottles in question, one white and one red, would be illegal in France because they are made from a blend of French and Australian base wines.",
      "Under both French and European Union law it is forbidden to make a wine that combines EU and non-EU fruit. In France in particular, authorities take such things very seriously.",
      "The French wine industry has a celebrated word called \"terroir\", which applies to all the environmental factors that affect vines growing in a vineyard, such the soil, the climate, and the elevation. As a result, wines from a specific place are held in the highest esteem.",
      "Add a strict appellation or classification system for France's wine regions, and the thought of blending French and Australian wine to create a global hybrid would horrify many French wine lovers.",
      "Yet Maxime has done just this, and it is all thanks to one word - Brexit.",
      "For while he cannot sell the two wines in the EU, he can do so in the UK now that London no longer has to follow food and drink rules set by Brussels.",
      "Maxime has created the wines in partnership with UK online retailer The Wine Society, where they are called Hemispheres Red and Hemispheres White. The red is made from syrah grapes, or shiraz as they are called in Australia, while the white is a blend of marsanne and viognier varieties.",
      "The Australian red and white wine components are shipped in bulk to the UK, where they are blended with wine from France's northern Rhone and Roussillon regions before bottling.",
      "Maxime who works for his family's celebrated Rhone-based wine company Chapoutier, say that while he respects France's focus on terroir, there should be room for global blends to also be sold.",
      "\"Chapoutier has been making wine for more than 200 years, very terroir driven, and biodynamic,\" he says. \"But more and more people are turning their back on French wines because they don't understand the complicated appellation rules.",
      "\"We need to adapt for consumers and make wines more accessible, which international blends can help to do. Maybe the EU law will change. It is also more ecological to ship wine from Australia to Europe in bulk, as you don't have the weight of all the glass bottles.\"",
      "Another wine company now making wines by combining grapes from two continents is Australian firm Penfolds. It sells reds made from both Australian and Californian grapes, and others that mix Australian and French. Again they cannot be sold in the EU, but they can in the UK, US, Australia and elsewhere.",
      "Penfolds refers to these blends as \"wine of the world\", and says that they \"possess an otherness that can best be described as worldly\". Whatever that is supposed to mean.",
      "Unsurprisingly, some more traditional winemakers are not in favour of this development. One such person is Jas Swan, an independent winemaker based in Germany.",
      "While the two-continent blends from Chapoutier and Penfolds are made with care from quality grapes, and priced accordingly, she is fearful that if the trend grows it will mean a lot more cheap, low-grade wine going on sale.",
      "\"I believe that those types of wine would have nothing left of any terroir, even before they left their continent,\" she says. \"Those wines would have seen only machine work, heavy additions to keep them clean, and are manufactured to be easy to drink for the masses.",
      "\"Why can consumers not be more demanding? The consumerism is insane.\"",
      "Peter Richards, who holds the top global wine industry qualification, the master of wine (MW), is also sniffy. \"The notion of cross-country blending for wine isn't something I find outrageous in itself,\" he says. \"My concern is more that this is about creating novelty for novelty's sake.\"",
      "His wife, Susie Barrie, who is also an MW, adds: \"I remain to be convinced that a wine made by blending grapes from different countries can be great in terms of taste.\"",
      "By contrast, wine writer Jamie Goode says that development of two-continent wine \"is actually quite a fun idea\".",
      "\"If the wines are good, and made well from good vineyard sites - and not simply a gimmick blending together cheap bulk wines and then slapping a huge margin on the wine - then this is quite interesting.",
      "\"The fundamental basis for fine wine is the notion of terroir - that wines come from a place, and their flavour expresses this place in unique ways. But not all wines have to be terroir wines, and there's room for wines like this.",
      "\"In some ways, there's a lot of skill required to blend the right wines together to create something interesting coming from such different places.\"",
      "Pierre Mansour, head of buying for The Wine Society, says he and his colleagues came up with the idea of creating two wines made from grapes from different continents as part of the company's 150th birthday celebrations.",
      "\"We were thinking about the future of wine, and we wanted to do something innovative. In the end we thought that one area of innovation is blending, of creating a wine that can mitigate for the impact of climate change on a particular country.",
      "\"And from a carbon footprint out of view, it is more environmentally friendly to ship wine in bulk from Australia to the UK. But at the same time we did expect 'terroirists' to say 'hold on this is fundamentally against the French principle of wine'.",
      "\"So we approached Chapoutier, thinking that they might say 'are you mad, how dare you insult us', but they were great. They were really enthusiastic.\""

      "\"It's funny because I am so different to my character,\" says Jodie Campbell, who plays Leah. \"I felt a lot of imposter syndrome at the start of series one because I was working with such talented people.\"",
      "Most of the actors were able to channel their feelings of imposter syndrome into their characters who are navigating how to fit into a school that wasn't built for them.",
      "But Campbell says she wasn't able to do that as her character \"doesn't feel any imposter syndrome\".",
      "\"Leah thinks it's the institution's fault for not welcoming her and she believes she has every right to be there.\"",
      "As the most outspoken of the scholarship students, Leah refuses to conform to the school's traditions and expectations. She finds herself regularly in trouble for challenging authority figures like the headmaster.",
      "'I laugh at ridiculousness of racism'",
      "In the first series, Leah confronts the entrenched racism at St. Gilbert's by challenging the display of a racist painting and Campbell says it was hard to perform scenes that tackled issues of racism and microaggressions.",
      "\"I had to really prepare myself for some scenes,\" she explains. \"I was looking at an offensive painting every day and that was hard but I used that fuel to arm my character\".",
      "She adds that it's important for these conversations to be had and Boarders does it well as it \"explores those difficult topics through comedy\".",
      "Tedeku says he appreciated having other actors similar to him around so that when things got too much they could \"group together and laugh at how stupid things are\".",
      "\"I actually think racism is funny in that I laugh at how ridiculous it is that you can hate someone so much that you go out of your way to make fun of them or single them out all because of the colour of their skin.\"",
      "The first season of Boarders was largely praised by critics - The Guardian awarded it four-stars and said the show doesn't get \"bogged down in conflicts about race and class\" and instead \"encompasses all the mess and joy of youth, where few people ever really feel that they fit in\".",
      "Similarly, The Telegraph called Boarders \"razor-sharp\" and said it tackles \"everything from bigotry to inclusion\".",
      "The Daily Mail, however, wasn't impressed, suggesting it was \"full of lazy sterotypes\" and giving it only one star.",
      "In the new series, the students are pitted against each other as the number of scholarships are to be whittled down from five to three.",
      "Tedeku says he knows what it feels like in real life to be set against his peers.",
      "\"There's a sense in some communities that only one person can get up at a time and we can't all go together, but that mindset needs to change.\"",
      "His co-star Sekou Diaby who plays Toby, agrees and explains that the acting industry \"can be a toxic environment\".",
      "\"Competition is healthy but sometimes it's so aggressive it's as if you're actually fighting each other. It's crazy and backwards to push your peers down.\"",
      "He believes the arts industry in the UK still has a long way to go and is far behind the industry in the US.",
      "\"In America you see more black minority groups working together to achieve something, but in the UK it feels like you're fighting for each other's spot.\"",
      "Diaby adds that it's even harder to break into the industry if you're from a working class background as \"there's a lot of nepotism in the industry\".",
      "\"But being different is also really powerful because your point of view is rarer in the industry so your take on things will be more unique and that's what will make you stand out.\"",

      "Evergreen is just 87 seconds long and didn't chart originally, but became the go-to song for \"hopecore\" videos offering snippets of positivity and optimism on TikTok last year. It spent 35 weeks in the UK top 60 in 2024, and was in the overall end-of-year top 100.",
      "Lovely - Billie Eilish (2018)",
      "Released on the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack, this track didn't reach the UK or US top 40s, but Eilish's delicate duet with Khalid is now her most-streamed song, and 14th on Spotify's all-time list. It is apparently, among other things, good for sending you to sleep.",
      "I Wanna Be Yours - Arctic Monkeys (2013)",
      "I Wanna Be Yours was on the hit AM album but only reached 99 in the UK as a single. However, last year it had more Spotify plays than any other song over a decade old. TikTok users have chosen the melodramatic chorus to soundtrack their romantic declarations.",
      "The Sound of Silence - Disturbed (2015)",
      "Hard rock band Disturbed's brooding but beautiful cover of the Simon and Garfunkel classic has now spent eight months in the UK top 60 in the past year, helped by a dance remix and a TikTok shuffle dance trend.",
      "See You Again by Tyler, the Creator (2017)",
      "See You Again didn't chart at the time but took off on TikTok (where else?), with one snippet turning into a personality quiz (do you sing along with Tyler's \"OK OK OK OK\" or guest vocalist Kali Uchis' \"La la la la\"?). The song finally reached number 21 in the UK in 2023, and was the 19th most-streamed song on Spotify in the US in 2024.",
      "Songs from all eras have been resurfacing for several years, of course.",
      "Many were hits to start with. Mr Brightside by The Killers (2004) is a fixture, while Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill (1985) and Sophie Ellis-Bextor's Murder on the Dancefloor (2001) shot back up the charts thanks to TV and film soundtracks.",
      "But when it comes to songs that weren't as big the first time around, the 2010s dominate.",
      "One reason is that people who grew up in those years are introducing their favourite tunes to others, according to Sarah Kloboves from music data analysts Chartmetric.",
      "\"This revival is pioneered by these older Gen Z listeners [in their mid-20s]. But when they start to create these trends, you also have the younger Gen Zs and even Gen Alpha [young teens and below] that are hearing these songs for the first time - the release date is interesting because it's old, but it's not too old.\"",
      "Dredge agrees: \"A lot of the influencers on places like TikTok are a few years older, so they are probably using songs from the 2010s that soundtracked their teenage years.\"",
      "Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer (2019) could even be described as a sleeper hit - it wasn't released as an official single at the time, but eventually reached number one in 2023 and was the fifth-biggest song of 2024 overall on Apple Music.",
      "Others, though, are not such obvious hits. Musically, most sound quite restrained and atmospheric - they're emotive soundtrack songs rather than upbeat bangers or full-blooded anthems.",
      "\"These aren't songs that were released with the intention of being a pop hit,\" Kloboves says.",
      "\"Not to bash on pop music or pop stars, but sometimes they all sort of sound the same. But I think a lot of these songs are very different from what you might usually hear in the mainstream,\" she says.",
      "\"I think that's why listeners really resonate with them, because they're slightly unique and different-sounding.\"",
      "Eight more sleeper hits:",

      "Space Song by Beach House (2015)",
      "Apocalypse by Cigarettes After Sex (2017)",
      "Freaks by Surf Curse (2013)",
      "Many of these songs owe their belated success to TikTok, and tracks that take off \"evoke some kind of emotional response\" in the listener, the platform's UK head of music partnerships Toyin Mustapha believes.",
      "\"It's having something that emotionally resonates. That could be a lyric. It could be the way that the instrumental lands.\"",
      "And our relationship with music has changed. When packaging songs with clips on social media, fans are choosing them as soundtracks to evocative moments.",
      "\"It's no longer passive listening,\" Mustapha adds. \"People are really active participants in the culture. And they're active because they are taking this music and essentially reimagining it in their own way.\"",
      "Record labels do try to help back-catalogue songs become sleeper hits, but it normally happens organically thanks to fans, Dredge says.",
      "\"One of the things you can see is it's songs that lend themselves to a feeling or mood. It often is a particular line from the song that is the thing that is picked up on and goes viral,\" he says.",
      "\"There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it other than they suddenly feel relevant to someone in a way that other people appreciate.\"",
      "Sometimes, it's simply that a great song didn't get the attention it deserved at the time: \"Part of it is just that a brilliant song can connect with people, no matter how long ago it was made.\""

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:46:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The star discusses how she feels about blowing up on TikTok and the trademark honesty in her lyrics.",
    "story": [
      "South London singer Lola Young's unflinchingly honest hit Messy has reached number one in the UK after a two-month climb, and she's been nominated for a Brit Award. Now she's made a breakthrough, this could be her year.",
      "Lola Young jumps into a car, laughing uncontrollably as she flashes a brand new set of shiny gold teeth.",
      "\"I just got grills fitted,\" she explains once she's regained her composure. \"But they're like so intense, so you're rocking with this today, and a lisp.\"",
      "She's been running a few minutes late for the interview and this explains why - so she can finish getting her dental jewellery accessories fitted, with which she seems extremely pleased.",
      "The screen suddenly freezes. The car she's in is somewhere in the US and the reception has cut out.",
      "Young made her US TV debut on Jimmy Fallon's talk show the night before, which followed a whirlwind trip to Australia, and she'll soon set off on a sold-out European tour. She's talking on Zoom as her manager drives her to the next stop on her schedule.",
      "Travelling the world and in high demand, but making time to get a full set of solid gold teeth grills fitted - she's living a proper pop star's life.",
      "And she is now a proper pop star. After several years of almost making it - she sang on the 2021 John Lewis advert, was on the BBC Sound of 2022 list and had glowing reviews for her two albums - Messy has given her a bona fide hit.",
      "The song became inescapable at the end of 2024 and completed its climb to the top of the charts on Friday.",
      "The 24-year-old is the first current British artist to have a UK number one since Chase and Status and Stormzy in August, the youngest to do so since Dave in 2022, and the youngest British woman to score a chart-topper since Dua Lipa in 2017.",
      "Her number one came a day after she was nominated for best pop act at the Brit Awards.",
      "\"The response has been amazing and it's been really exciting to see all the love that Messy has been receiving,\" says Young after reconnecting the call.",
      "\"I love the song, it's a song I wrote that's really personal and really important to me. So I'm really happy that it's resonating so much.\"",
      "Messy was released on Young\u2019s second album This Wasn't Meant For You Anyway last May.",
      "Its trajectory was supercharged when superstar US influencers Sofia Richie Grainge and Jake Shane posted a 14-second TikTok clip of themselves dancing to its chorus. Young's song has now been used in 1.3 million videos on the platform - from Kylie Jenner lip-syncing as a dog, to a viral clip of an old woman vaping and holding a pint alongside the caption \"94 and still messy\".",
      "The singer would like to point out that the track's success is not simply down to TikTok, however.",
      "\"That's not necessarily how it blew up. I would like to say that the song was blowing up before TikTok, and it was having its moment elsewhere. A lot of things contributed to the success.",
      "\"The TikTok thing is great. I don't make music for TikTok. I make music for myself and for my fans, but the Sofia Richie thing is just one element of how well it did in every aspect.",
      "\"But yeah, it's been great to see every side of it.\"",
      "Contradictions",
      "The track was indeed starting to gain traction before finding TikTok virality, and has only done so well because it is more than a mere meme.",
      "Its lyrics, about never being good enough for someone whatever you do, have connected deeply with fans. \"I want to be me, is that not allowed?\" she implores.",
      "\"I guess it's because the song speaks to so many people in terms of, I'm talking about the idea that there's two sides of a person, the contradictions,\" Young says.",
      "The song captures how it is \"to basically feel like you're not enough for somebody and also in turn not enough for yourself\".",
      "Amid the craziness of success, there's some relief that she has now reached the next level in her career.",
      "\"I mean, I feel like it's the right time,\" the singer says. \"It's been a minute, but also it does feel like the right time for me.\"",
      "Young has also recently featured on Tyler, the Creator\u2019s well-received album Chromakopia.",
      "Grit and charisma",
      "When it was released, the Observer said Young\u2019s album had \"a winning combination of zingers and vulnerability\", and the Telegraph said it showed \"all of the grit and charisma of a seasoned artist\".",
      "Like Messy, many of her tracks are one-sided conversations - mainly with an unseen, unreasonable and unsuitable man (or woman).",
      "Other songs continue the theme of double-edged romance. Wish You Were Dead is about a relationship that veers between being affectionate and volatile; while in Big Brown Eyes, Young gets weak-kneed when a lukewarm love interest insults her.",
      "Unlike some artists, there's little need to ask Young what her songs are about - the stories are laid out in her raw and razor-sharp lyrics.",
      "But how real are the situations and scenarios about which she sings?",
      "\"Pretty real. As real as it gets, to be honest,\" she replies.",
      "\"I just write from my own experience and they're very real. They're all the things that I've been through, all situations I've had, and all experiences I've had.\"",
      "The honesty of her songwriting sets her apart from many other artists, but she says she knows no other way.",
      "\"I don't think about it. Music is the only place I can be dead honest,\" she says. \"Not that I'm a liar...",
      "\"But I feel like that's my outlet, the place I can be the most honest. I never really think about it. It doesn't feel like a difficult thing to do, or something that feels like I'm baring my soul or anything. It's just I've always done that in my music.\"",
      "The album ends with an equally candid spoken-word outro, in which she says the LP was written to help her accept and love herself, and to realise she doesn't need \"no ugly man (or woman)\".",
      "\"I haven't got there yet but I will,\" she says on the track.",
      "'Different angle' on Brat",
      "Young is managed by two men who separately worked with Amy Winehouse and Adele, and she has something in common with those two artists in her combination of fragility and front.",
      "To that, she adds the conversational tone of Lily Allen and the modern pop sensibility and chaotic energy of Charli XCX.",
      "Young's breakthrough coincided with the reign of Charli's Brat ethos, which she defined as \"a girl who is a little messy, likes to party, maybe says dumb things sometimes, feels herself, and has a breakdown but parties through it\".",
      "Young feels an affinity with that. \"I massively do, and I think it's that thing of empowered women who like to party and be themselves, and that's really important to me,\" she says.",
      "\"I guess I come from a different angle - of a less heightened version of that, I guess. It would be more like, 'I don't really give a [care], but I also really do'. That's what I guess I stand by a little bit more.\"",
      "Bratpop season will stretch further when Young releases her next album later this year. It is nearly finished and will \"dig deeper\" than the last, she says. How much deeper can she really dig?",
      "\"Quite a lot,\" she says. \"There's quite a lot more to say. There's a lot of other topics and things that have happened to me, and things that I've gone through that I want to discuss with people.",
      "\"But also things that are a little bit less about love, and about other things that I've gone through.\"",
      "Now that Messy's cleaned up, we can expect to see more of Young, and her shiny teeth."

      "Oscar winner Adrien Brody delved deep into his own family history for his portrayal of the character, reflecting on his mother and grandparents' experiences in fleeing their native Hungary, which after World War Two was becoming a satellite state of the Soviet Union.",
      "\"The wonderful thing is, it's an opportunity for me to honour my ancestral struggles - my mother and my grandparents' hardships and loss in fleeing Hungary in the '50s and emigrating to the United States.",
      "\"[It's] very moving to be reminded of the details and hardships that they experienced that very much parallel the lived experience of my character,\" Brody says.",
      "The actor says his character's drive to create also reflects his own path as an actor.",
      "\"Any artistic person, I think, can relate to the struggle and yearnings to leave, create a body of work and leave behind something of great meaning,\" he says.",
      "'Epic length'",
      "The relationships in the film might be intimate and personal, but they're set against a backdrop that is in so many ways epic - not least its running time. It clocks in at over three-and-a-half hours - something that might put off some moviegoers.",
      "But director Brady Corbet believes The Brutalist's length really shouldn't deter audiences.",
      "\"For me, I think that the length of a movie is similar to the length of a book, a double album, a painting with a big canvas.",
      "\"I love small portraits and I love Anselm Kiefer (a German artist known for his large-scale installations). There's a space for both of them, you know. And at the end of the day, especially because the film has an intermission, it's only 100 minutes on each side, so it's not so bad.\"",

      "\"I spend most of my life foraging through scripts, trying to find decent characters to play. That's a huge part of it,\" she explains.",
      "\"I have to find someone who has some kind of spunk, or has some fight in them. Some sense of defiance is so key, so when I read the script it was an absolute no-brainer.",
      "\"I thought this woman is tremendous. But... they are few and far between, for sure. When you get something like this, you just grab it with both hands.\"",
      "In the film, T\u00f3th is hired by rich industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren to design and build a vast project as a tribute to his late mother. Van Buren, played by Guy Pearce, is a man who is in awe of the architect's talent. A useful parallel, then, for the actor.",
      "\"I suppose so,\" admits the Australian. \"I really admire Adrien and his work. I think he's an extraordinary actor.",
      "\"It was really interesting the way Adrien played his role. He plays a man who has almost more sense of self than Van Buren does, which was a great thing for me to work off because I think Van Buren, even though he admires L\u00e1szl\u00f3, he probably is patronising of him.",
      "\"He probably expects him to be more subservient than he is, so it was a great dynamic between the two of us.\"",
      "On Thursday, the film was nominated for 10 Oscars, including a best-actor nomination for Brody. Even before the Academy Awards shortlists were announced, Brody said how thankful he was for the reception the film had received from awards bodies.",
      "\"I'm just really grateful and I'm very appreciative of having had a chance to flourish in a work that I've dedicated a life towards. And when that is received with respect and appreciation. It's very rewarding.\"",

      "But some people, like Radio 1 & 1Xtra DJ Kenny Allstar, would say it's been there all along.",
      "He's been a champion of the West London rapper, also known as Cench, for years and has watched him become one of the UK's biggest talents.",
      "He says that's down to the rapper, who understands that music, the industry around it, and how we listen has changed dramatically.",

    "story": [
      "Did the hero Prince slay the tabloid dragon? Or to quote one of its most memorable headlines, was it The Sun Wot Won It?",
      "The dust is still settling on the settlement of Prince Harry's epic legal battle against News Group Newspapers.",
      "Had the trial gone ahead, Prince Harry would have alleged he had been the victim of unlawful newsgathering by NGN journalists between 1996 and 2011 - and that its leaders covered up wrongdoing by destroying evidence - something that the company denied. But the eight-week trial didn't happen because the two sides suddenly settled.",
      "He's scored an apology for intrusion by The Sun, including NGN accepting that there was unlawful information gathering by private investigators working for the newspaper.",
      "NGN has not admitted unlawful activity by journalists or editors - and the settlement means a judge won't now have to decide if there was, as the Duke's team alleges, a corporate cover-up of wrongdoing - a claim NGN vehemently denied and said it would fight at trial.",
      "The space between those positions, in which both sides will feel they won something, is now the battleground.",
      "The question is how far, realistically, can a campaign around historical events go? Is this week a reboot of investigations or, in fact, the final chapter?",
      "The main focus of pressure and lobbying will be the police - because campaigners believe Scotland Yard didn't go far enough in its previous investigations, missing opportunities to widen its focus beyond wrongdoing at The News of the World.",
      "'Dossier' being prepared",
      "Speaking to the BBC on Friday, actor Hugh Grant - who said the financial risks forced him to settle, with The Sun's owners last year - said the police's job was not done \"by any means\" - and suing the newspapers was never going to get at the full truth.",
      "So all eyes will be on Lord Tom Watson, the former Labour deputy leader, who NGN admits was placed under surveillance by News of the World journalists in 2009.",
      "The last remaining claimant alongside Prince Harry, he says a dossier will go to the Metropolitan Police.",
      "The Met for its part says there is no active criminal investigation into alleged newspaper wrongdoing.",
      "That statement also means there's no current probe into the separate Mirror Group titles, despite a judge ruling in 2023 that they had used phone hacking to get information on Prince Harry.",
      "So why no investigation?",
      "The police aren't ruling one out, but Sir Mark Rowley, the Met's commissioner, told LBC radio on Friday that they would need to see something \"radically new\".",
      "And that's because Scotland Yard takes the view that it carried out a huge investigation 10 years ago.",
      "Team Harry believe this is profoundly myopic. While some of their planned evidence for the NGN trial had come from the police, his lawyers also obtained new documents from NGN itself under rules for a fair trial.",
      "Could that be new evidence? Let's take the example of the records of the myriad of payments to private investigators.",
      "Team Harry and Watson would have sought to prove at a trial that many were for unlawful activity. On one level you can see that would arguably fit a test of something radically new.",
      "But, in its defence, News Group would have argued that none of this proved journalists or anyone else at the Sun knew information was being unlawfully gathered - far short of a whiff of a criminal enterprise.",
      "The full apology to Prince Harry from Sun owner",
      "Hugh Grant urges police to investigate Sun owners",
      "What this single episode we had been expecting to see at the trial shows is how each allegation against NGN would have been fought rather than conceded. And if the police knock on the company's door with its truncheon, they are likely to face a similarly robust response.",
      "And that's why the thrust of Lord Watson's promised dossier to the police will become important. It will have to say something really big. And in the absence of a court finding - that challenge becomes larger still.",
      "Other bodies could in theory act. Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee investigated phone-hacking allegations in 2011. It's likely to face calls to review the evidence of NGN CEO Rebekah Brooks and others - evidence that NGN will stand by because there's been no finding in court of unlawful activity by journalists, editors or executives.",
      "There's also the Information Commissioner's Office. It had a role in the origins of this story, investigating privacy and data breaches by private investigators. The ICO says it has no plans to reopen or review this investigation.",
      "The government has already ruled out launching \"Leveson 2\", the second leg of the public inquiry promised by David Cameron. It was meant to investigate \"unlawful or improper conduct\" across tabloids and whether the police, put simply, had turned a blind eye to it because they had been corrupted by getting too close to journalists who may have been paying them off. But it never happened.",
      "Labour in government won't revisit it because too much time has passed."

      "The review was tasked with shaping a new counter-extremism strategy, addressing online and offline threats from Islamist and the far-right alongside a broader spectrum of extremism.",
      "The government's current definition of extremism is the promotion of an ideology based on violence, hatred or intolerance that aims to destroy the rights and freedoms of others or undermine liberal parliamentary democracy.",

      "Six years later, a third runway was once again given the green light by Theresa May's government.",

      "The debate was attended by people who have lost loved ones to crashes, including Crystal Owen from Shrewsbury, whose 17-year-old son Harvey died alongside three friends in a crash in North Wales.",

      "Growth, Reeves will reiterate, is the priority.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Last week, Friends of the Earth said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "But is expanding the country's biggest airport the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",

      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

      "Many Muslims and people of colour felt afraid to leave their homes.",
      "\"It was so visceral. We were watching on our screens: people breaking doors down, stopping cars, attacking taxi drivers, smashing windows, smashing mosques,\" she told the BBC. \"The kind of evil we saw was really terrifying and I felt like, am I even making a difference?\"",

      "\"It was the Southport riots for us that made it really quite alarming. The justification was there, the urgency, the necessity of engagement was there, British Muslims were under attack, mosques were under attack and the largest umbrella Muslim organisation wasn't being talked to,\" she said.",
      "Strains in the relationship between successive governments and the MCB began over a decade ago. Ties were severed with the MCB in 2009 under then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, after the group's deputy leader signed a declaration advocating attacks on the Royal Navy if it tried to stop arms for Hamas. Hamas's military wing had been proscribed as a terror group in the UK eight years earlier.",
      "The deputy secretary later resigned and Ms Mohammed said the MCB made clear such actions did not reflect the organisation, leading to a brief period of re-engagement.",

In 2018, when asked about Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, then Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the government did not engage with MCB as \"too many of their members have had favourable comments on extremists and that's not acceptable\" - claims the MCB vehemently denied at the time.",
      "For Ms Mohammed, there were hopes that engagement would be renewed when Labour entered government last year as she described \"strong\" and \"positive\" relationships with Labour MPs. However, the policy of non-engagement has continued without any explanation.",
      "She said this was having a \"terrible impact\" on communities who \"do not feel Islamophobia is being taken seriously\". \"At least have a conversation about it, but to not say anything and not tell us why? Surely what happened 14 years ago cannot be the justification.",

      "Despite calls for change following the murder, Leadbeater said there had been an erosion in people's ability to \"disagree well\".",
      "Speaking to Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast, she argued \"the level of abuse and nastiness\" in political debate was \"worse than ever\".",
      "Leadbeater, now Labour MP for her late sister's constituency, said proposing her bill to legalise assisted dying had exposed her to a level of abuse she had never endured before.",

      "\"We will take oral evidence from over 50 witnesses, which is highly, highly unusual for a private members bill,\" she said.",
      "This week, the first stages of line-by-line scrutiny of the bill sparked heated debate, with accusations of bias towards pro-assisted dying voices.",
      "But Leadbeater argued she had taken \"a really open approach\" to the bill, welcoming amendments.",
      "\"It is upsetting and disappointing sometimes to people who are suggesting otherwise - because we've got to get this right,\" she said.",
      "\"It is not just about passing the law, it's about passing good law that achieves what we are trying to achieve but does not create other problems and takes into account everybody's views.\"",
      "The bill's committee will begin its first oral evidence session on 28 January.",

      "Jeremy Newmark, the leader of the council, described it as a \"momentous development for our borough\", although the project could be some years away from completion.",
      "In the UK, data centres are set to be classified as critical national infrastructure, similar to the emergency services and energy and water supplies.",
      "The developers said DC01UK would be \"Europe's largest cloud and AI data centre\".",
      "Outline planning approval sets broad principles around the proposed development, but there will be further rounds of public consultation.",
      "Newmark, chair of the Hertfordshire Growth Board, said: \"While outline planning permission has been granted, we will of course continue to listen to and engage with residents about these exciting plans as more details are firmed up.",
      "\"As I've said before, I'm sure local people will see the massive value this development could bring to our area.\"",
      "Peter Waine, chair of the Hertfordshire branch of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, questioned the decision to put the development on green belt land.",
      "He said: \"It is a huge potential development, it is the biggest in Europe, and along with the proposed 1,000 houses that will be built adjacent there is going to be hardly any green belt between Potters Bar and the M25 at South Mimms.",
      "\"It may not be the most wonderful and beautiful green belt but it is green belt... I admit it's not the Lake District but it is land on our doorstep \u2013 it is open space.\"",
      "Newmark responded: \"We are not going to apologise as an authority for making a choice that is [to] the benefit of local people and provides critical national infrastructure that our country needs to deliver on the government's national growth mission.\"",
      "A spokesperson for DC01UK said: \"This approval will also solidify Hertsmere's status as a leading region... as a tech and media superhub, complementing other established, large technology-driven organisations and film studios in the area.",
      "\"Our plan will put Hertfordshire at the epicentre of the new data centre revolution, as well as creating \u00a33.75bn for the economy during construction and almost 14,000 indirect jobs once operational.\"",

      "Defence Secretary John Healey announced the eight-year contract, called Unity, on Friday during a visit to the firm's nuclear reactor production facility in Derby.",
      "It is hoped it will create more than 1,000 UK jobs and safeguard 4,000 other roles.",
      "Healey said Derby had a crucial role to play in protecting the United Kingdom at a time when it was \"facing rising threats and aggression\".",
      "Unity is designed to make the design, manufacture and support services for reactors more efficient and environmentally friendly.",
      "The government said the agreement would streamline previous contracts and incentives, and provide more efficient delivery, leading to savings of \u00a3400m.",
      "As well as providing support to the current UK Royal Navy submarine fleet, Unity includes the build and commission of new Dreadnought Class submarines and the beginning of contracts for the new Aukus defence alliance.",
      "In March 2023, it was announced Rolls-Royce would provide the reactors for the new fleet of nuclear submarines in a defence agreement between the UK, US and Australia.",
      "The submarines will be built in Britain and Australia but use technology from all three countries.",
      "The company opened a new Nuclear Skills Academy in Derby in 2022, designed to provide 200 apprenticeships each year for at least a decade.",
      "Healey used the visit to highlight the government's \"triple lock\" on the nuclear deterrent, which includes building four new nuclear submarines in Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, maintaining the UK's continuous at sea nuclear deterrent and delivering all future upgrades needed.",
      "He said: \"This investment in Britain's defence will deliver a long-term boost to British business, jobs and national security.",
      "\"In line with our Plan for Change, this deal with Rolls-Royce, a historic British success story, will support high-skilled UK jobs, who equip the thousands of submariners that keep us all safe.",
      "\"We are showing defence can be an engine for growth, while also driving better value for taxpayer money.\"",
      "'Heart of our defence'",
      "When asked how significant Derby was to the UK's defence following this deal, the minister responded to say that the city \"couldn't be more important\", said the Local Democracy Reporting Service.",
      "Healey said: \"Rolls-Royce is a company that is a proud British brand. It made the engines that powered the Spitfires that kept our skies safe. It is now making the engines now that power our submarines and keeping our seas safe.",
      "\"We are standing in the nuclear skills centre \u2013 a centre of excellence, not just in the UK but almost anywhere in the world. Rolls-Royce and the people who work here do things that nobody else in the world can do.",
      "\"We are proud to have them at the heart of our defence plans for the future. I'm proud as defence secretary to make this long-term commitment to Derby.\"",
      "The announcement comes days after Healey issued a warning to Russia in Parliament after a Russian spy ship was spotted around UK waters.",
      "The minister added: \"Britain is safe, its people are safe and they are safe because of our armed forces and the extraordinary job they are prepared to do on behalf of us all.",
      "\"But I don't want to mislead people either \u2013 we face rising threats and immediate aggression from Russia.\"",
      "Steve Carlier, president of Rolls-Royce Submarines, said: \"We're delighted to announce the Unity contract, which confirms our commitment to the Royal Navy and the Defence Nuclear Enterprise.",

      "Sources in London describe the call as \"very warm\" and \"very personal\". It appears the big picture, and getting to know each other, was the aim, rather than policy detail.",

      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer have both said the government could not have risked Axel Rudakubana walking free by ignoring advice that publishing information could have jeopardised his trial.",
      "But Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said it was likely an \"information vacuum\" had resulted in misinformation which \"fuelled\" the riots which followed the attack.",
      "He asked why the discovery of ricin and a copy of an al-Qaeda training manual in Rudakubana's house could not have been swiftly revealed.",
      "Cooper said the government had wanted to make public that Rudakubana had been referred to the counter-extremism programme Prevent, but could not because of legal advice.",
      "Rudakubana was charged with three counts of murder and 10 of attempted murder on 31 July, shortly after launching his attack which killed Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine.",
      "Within days, in early August, officers searching Rudakubana's home found ricin and a file entitled \"Military Studies in the Jihad against the Tyrants, the al-Qaeda training manual\".",
      "The government was kept up-to-date about the discovery. The BBC has been told the ricin was in a Tupperware box in his bedroom.",
      "Police rarely give details of an ongoing investigation without what they describe as a \"policing purpose\".",
      "In this case, false rumours were spreading online about the killer, including that he had migrated to Britain.",
      "Senior officers felt under pressure to reassure the public, and dispel some of the rumours about the suspect by making clear he was in fact British.",
      "But after discovering the ricin and manual they did not immediately make this public.",
      "The investigation continued, with searches taking weeks because of the need for teams to wear hazmat suits and take a break every 40 minutes.",
      "As they prepared to announce the outcome to the investigation, senior police officers became frustrated that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was advising them to withhold many details they felt should be made public, due to false claims online.",

      "A source said the CPS \"put a load of red pen through the statement\".",
      "Rudakubana was finally charged with the additional two offences on 29 October.",
      "It was at this point, three months after the Southport attacks, that police made public for the first time that the ricin and manual had been found.",
      "He was not charged with preparing for acts of terrorism because, under current laws, this would involve finding evidence of a political motivation or ideology, and none had been found.",
      "The prime minister suggested on Tuesday the laws defining terrorism might need to change to take account of \"loners, misfits, young men in their bedroom\".",
      "Neil Basu, former counterterrorism chief at the Metropolitan Police, told Radio 4's Today programme that he thought doing so would be a mistake.",
      "\"Bad legislation is made in haste in response to shocking incidents,\" he said. \"We need to think very carefully about the unintended consequences.\"",
      "Mr Basu said the people the prime minister pointed to were not terrorists but rather \"violent individuals\" who use \"any ideology as an excuse for their violent actions\". As such, some would \"revel\" in being branded a terrorist.",
      "Adding to the workload of counter-terror teams would also \"come with a very large bill\", Mr Basu said.",
      "Lord Carlile, who previously served as the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, agreed with Sir Keir that it was \"high time\" to review the definition of terrorism in UK law to include lone attackers who do not have a clear motivation.",
      "He told BBC Breakfast that he thought Rudakubana being a British citizen should have been made public far quicker, as claims about him being a migrant helped fuel the riots.",
      "But he said regarding the other details that it was \"not for the prime minister, or for retired police officers, or for the police, or for the newspapers to prejudice a trial by disclosing material that could undermine the integrity of that trial\".",
      "Rudakubana has now pleaded guilty to all the charges he faced and will be sentenced on Thursday.",
      "Normally the risk of jeopardising the case falls away once all charges have been decided, either by a plea, or a jury reaching a verdict.",
      "Crime reporters attended a police and CPS-led briefing setting out the entire case - but on Monday, the CPS again decided the information should not be published, this time until after the sentencing.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer's deputy official spokesperson told political reporters on Tuesday afternoon that the prime minister had \"not strayed\" into areas related to sentencing.",
      "Yet the CPS insists it needs to protect the sentencing process due to take place on Thursday.",
      "Nick Price, CPS director of legal services, said: \"The next stage of the process is for the prosecution to present our full case to the court on Thursday - including relevant details of the defendant's past - so the judge can consider all the evidence when passing sentence.",
      "\"This will be the point when the full details of this case will be heard by the public.",
      "\"We recognise the profound interest in these proceedings, and it is important the prosecution case is presented to the court so the facts can be determined which may inform the sentence handed down.\"",

    "summary": "Years of delay and dispute have worn down support for what was once the government's flagship policy.",
    "story": [
      "After years of delay and dispute, the Scottish government has ripped up its plans for a National Care Service.",
      "The plans have gone from the flagship announcement of the parliamentary term and potentially a cornerstone of Nicola Sturgeon's legacy, to a non-statutory advisory board.",
      "Some \u00a330m was spent in the process, amid a series of consultations, legislative redrafts and political rows.",
      "But when the plans were first announced, there was widespread support for the principle of reforming social care. Many were in favour of the idea of ending a \"postcode lottery\" across different areas.",
      "So what happened to bring the National Care Service crashing to earth?",
      "Has it been scrapped?",
      "To be clear, yes.",
      "It might be a bit confusing, given the government says it remains committed to a National Care Service, and that the bill to set it up is still going through parliament.",
      "But care minister Maree Todd has agreed to remove part one of the bill - the part literally titled \"the National Care Service\".",
      "The vision originally set out by Nicola Sturgeon - of a game-changing network of care boards across the country, a mirror for the NHS - is completely gone.",
      "It had already been hugely diluted, stripped back to a national oversight board, amid concerns over costs and a lack of detail in the plans.",
      "All that's left now is a non-statutory advisory board, and widely-supported proposals to strengthen the rights of people living in care homes, known as \"Anne's law\".",
      "While it will no doubt do important work, the government has almost 300 advisory boards currently active - this is not the game-changing innovation of a National Care Service as it has ever been promised.",
      "Delivery problems",
      "The vision of a groundbreaking new care service began its slow-motion crash into harsh reality when the government started trying to construct a legal framework for it.",
      "The legislation laid before parliament was an \"enabling bill\", which set out the broad idea of a care service but left finer details to be filled in by ministers later.",
      "MSPs reacted with alarm, with almost every committee in the parliament questioning how they could properly scrutinise the plans when there was so little substance attached.",
      "The bill was held up repeatedly due to a lack of firm costings attached to the project, with members demanding that fresh financial memorandums be drawn up.",
      "Money quickly became a problem, and the budget for setting up the scheme - projected as \u00a32.2bn over ten years at one point - became an easy target when ministers needed to make cuts.",
      "That inevitably led to delays, with the target delivery date drifting from 2026 to 2029.",
      "And when the plans were stripped back, it made the legislative process even more complicated, requiring massive amendments to the bill already before parliament.",
      "It made it all the easier for people to call for the government to start over from scratch - or indeed to bin the plans and just channel the funding directly to frontline care instead.",
      "Industry concerns",
      "The government was keen to pursue a \"co-design\" process with those who would be closely involved in the running and use of a National Care Service.",
      "The sheer breadth of groups involved in caring underlines the difficulty of reform - there are councils, health boards, \"integrated joint boards\", health and social care partnerships, independent care providers, staff unions, and more.",
      "While there was support for the principle of improving care services in many quarters, some of these groups had concerns about the plans from the very outset - and others grew increasingly alienated as time went by.",
      "The original vision would have shifted responsibility for staffing and the delivery of care to the new care boards - which councils saw as undermining local control of services.",
      "The redrafted plans would have seen councils keep more of that control under a \"shared accountability\" model, but that too ultimately proved unpopular.",
      "The decision of council leaders to walk away from negotiations in September 2024 was really the moment which signalled the end of the road.",
      "It followed on the heels of unions which represent many carers - including Unison - coming out against the proposals.",
      "Without the support of those at the sharp end of actually delivering care, there was just no way that the NCS could become a reality.",
      "Political spats",
      "The collapse of the care service plans has spanned the reigns of three first ministers, each of whom insisted at some point that they were completely committed to delivering on them.",
      "Politics has undoubtedly played a part.",
      "But when it was first announced, there was not a wave of opposition to the idea of a care service at Holyrood.",
      "Indeed a few of the opposition parties remain in favour of the plans in principle - Labour in particular have just run on a manifesto promising to set one up at a UK level.",
      "But positions hardened as the policy process dragged on and concerns over the lack of detail in the bill mounted.",
      "The final straw came when the Greens withdrew their support in October 2024.",
      "That left the SNP completely isolated, with no clear way of building a coalition to get the bill passed.",
      "The government is actually quite keen to stress that there is no route through parliament for the bill, because it spreads the blame around other parties.",
      "But it is fair to reflect that political opposition has grown over time, in parallel with concerns about the proposals across a much wider base."

      "When spent nuclear fuel is separated it into its component parts, one of the products is plutonium.",
      "Successive governments have kept the material to leave open the option to recycle it into new nuclear fuel.",
      "Storing this highly radioactive material - in its current form - is expensive and difficult. It needs to be frequently repackaged, because radiation damages the containers it's kept in. And it's guarded by armed police. All that costs the taxpayer more than \u00a370m per year.",
      "The government has made the decision that the safest - most economically viable solution - is to \"immobilise\" its entire plutonium stockpile.",
      "That means that a facility will be built at Sellafield where the plutonium can be converted into a stable, rock-like material, which can eventually be disposed of deep underground.",
      "In a statement, energy minister Michael Shanks said the objective was \"to put this material beyond reach, into a form which both reduces the long-term safety and security burden during storage and ensures it is suitable for disposal\".",
      "Nuclear materials scientist Dr Lewis Blackburn from the University of Sheffield said the plutonium would be \"converted into a ceramic material\" which, while still radioactive, is solid and stable so it is deemed safe to dispose of.",
      "\"The type of ceramic remains to be decided [and selecting the right material] is the subject of ongoing research.\"",
      "Nuclear waste expert Prof Claire Corkhill from the University of Bristol said the goverment's decision was a \"positive step\".",
      "She told BBC News that it paved the way to removing the cost and hazard of storing plutonium at Sellafield \"by transforming it and locking it away into a solid, durable material that will last for millions of years in a geological disposal facility\".",
      "\"These materials are based on those we find in nature - natural minerals, that we know have contained uranium for billions of years.\"",
      "The government is currently in the early stages of a long technical and political process of choosing a suitable site to build a deep geological facility that will eventually be the destination for all of the country's most hazardous radioactive waste. That facility will not be operational until at least 2050."

      "None of these stories are going to challenge Harry Potter or Roald Dahl any time soon, but it is a start for more refined ideas to flourish perhaps.",
      "DeepSeek, on the other hand, responded with just one idea - \"Luna and the Boy Who Chased the Stars\". Its response was 387 words (with no mention of anyone or thing called \"Luna\"), and comprised a story about a curious boy called Milo who lived on the moon.",
      "It struck me that while ChatGPT gave me ideas, DeepSeek wrote a full story. It wasn't particularly good, with a simple focus on a character going from A to B, but it was a start - and it was impressive how quickly it delivered it.",

      "How would the chatbots deal with explaining such a complex and nuanced piece of history? Pretty well.",
      "ChatGPT gave a detailed account and outlined the key factors. DeepSeek's account was not as detailed, but its brief overview did cover all the main points and events.",
      "Google's Gemini assistant gave a similar synopsis to ChatGPT and DeepSeek, and also gave the user the opportunity to click on links from reputable sources such as the Imperial War Museum in the UK.",

      "DeepSeek was the most downloaded free app on Apple's US App Store over the weekend. By Monday, the new AI chatbot had triggered a massive sell-off of major tech stocks which were in freefall as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Shares of AI chip designer and recent Wall Street darling Nvidia, for example, had plunged by 17% by the time US markets closed on Monday. Or to put it in even starker terms, it lost nearly $600bn in market value which, according to Bloomberg, is the biggest drop in the history of the US stock market.",
      "This extraordinary, historic spooking can largely be attributed to something as simple as cost. And a claim by DeepSeek's developers which prompted serious questions in Silicon Valley.",
      "While ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has been haemorrhaging money - spending $5bn last year alone - DeepSeek's developers say it built this latest model for a mere $5.6m.",

      "The US may still go on to command the sector, but there is a sense that DeepSeek has shaken some of that swagger.",
      "Trump's words after the Chinese app's sudden emergence in recent days were probably cold comfort to the likes of Altman and Ellison. He called this moment a \"wake-up call\" for the American tech industry, and said finding a way to do cheaper AI is ultimately a \"good thing\".",
      "It is also worth noting that it was not just tech stocks that took a beating on Monday. Energy stocks did too. DeepSeek's arrival on the scene has upended many assumptions we have long held about what it takes to develop AI.",
      "Maybe that nuclear renaissance - including firing up America's Three Mile Island energy plant once again - won't be needed. Maybe it does not take so much capital, compute, and power after all.",

      "A note appended to a misleading post can also organically cut its viral spread by more than half, X maintains, and research suggests they also increase the chance that the original poster will delete the tweet by 80% .",
      "Keith Coleman, who oversees community notes for X, argues Meta is switching to a more capable fact checking programme.",
      "\"Community notes are already covering a vastly wider range of content than previous systems,\" he told me.",
      "\"That is rarely mentioned. I see stories that say 'Meta ends fact checking program',\" he said.",
      "\"But I think the real story is, 'Meta replaces existing fact checking program with approach that can scale to cover more content, respond faster and is trusted across the political spectrum'.\"",
      "Checking the fact checkers",
      "But of course, Mr Zuckerberg did not simply say community notes were a better system - he actively criticised fact checkers, accusing them of \"bias\".",
      "In doing so, he was echoing a long-held belief among US conservatives that Big Tech is censoring their views.",
      "Others argue fact checking will inevitably censor controversial views.",
      "Silkie Carlo, director of UK civil liberties group Big Brother Watch - which ran a campaign against alleged censorship of David Davis MP by YouTube - told the BBC allegations of Big Tech bias have come from across the political spectrum.",
      "Centralised fact checking by platforms risks \"stifling valuable reporting on controversial content\", she told the BBC, and also leads users to wrongly believe that all the posts they are reading are the \"vetted truth\".",
      "But Baybars Orsek, the managing director of Logically Facts, which supplies fact checking services to Meta in the UK, argues professional fact checkers can target the most dangerous misinformation and identify emerging \"harmful narratives\".",
      "Community-driven systems alone lack the \"consistency, objectivity and expertise\" to address the most harmful misinformation, he wrote.",
      "Professional fact checkers, and many experts and researchers, strongly dispute claims of bias. Some argue fact checkers simply lost the trust of many conservatives.",
      "A trust Mr Mantzarlis claims was deliberately undermined.",
      "\"Fact checkers started becoming arbiters of truth in a substantial way that upset politically-motivated partisans and people in power and suddenly, weaponised attacks were on them,\" he said.",
      "Trust in the algorithm",
      "The solution that X uses in an attempt to keep community notes trusted across the political spectrum is to take a key part of the process out of human hands, relying instead on an algorithm.",
      "The algorithm is used to select which notes are shown, and also to ensure they are found helpful by a range of users.",
      "In very simple terms, according to X, this \"bridging\" algorithm selects proposed notes that are rated helpful by volunteers who would normally disagree with each other.",
      "The result, it argues, is that notes are viewed positively across the political spectrum. This is confirmed, according to X, by regular internal testing. Some independent research also backs up that view.",
      "Meta says its community notes system will require agreement between people with a range of perspectives to help prevent biased ratings, \"just like they do on X\".",
      "But this wide acceptance is a high bar to reach.",
      "Research indicates that more than 90% of proposed community notes are never used.",
      "This means accurate notes may go unused.",
      "But according to X, showing more notes would undermine the aim of displaying only notes that will be found helpful by the most users and this would reduce trust in the system.",
      "'More bad stuff'",
      "Even after the fact checkers are gone, Meta will still employ thousands of moderators who remove millions of pieces of content every day, like graphic violence and child sexual exploitation material, which break the platform's rules.",
      "But Meta is relaxing its rules around some politically divisive topics such as gender and immigration.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg admitted the changes, designed to reduce the risk of censorship, meant it was \"going to catch less bad stuff\".",

      "Details of Meta's new plans for tackling misinformation are scarce. In principle, some experts believe community notes systems could be helpful - but many also feel they should not be a replacement for fact checkers.",

      "Last year, then-President Joe Biden signed a law that gave TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance until 19 January to sell the platform or face a ban in the United States.",
      "The legislation addressed concerns about TikTok's links to the Chinese government and worries about the app being a national security risk.",
      "President Donald Trump has floated the possibility of a joint venture.",
      "\"I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position,\" he said in a Truth Social post on Sunday. \"By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to [stay up].\"",
      "Trump has since signed an executive order that allows the app to stay operational for another 75 days.",
      "Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that China was considering a TikTok sale to Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a close ally of President Trump,  who already owns the social media platform X.",
      "Musk himself wrote on X this week that while he has long been against a TikTok ban, \"the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change\".",
      "At a news conference Tuesday, Trump was asked by a reporter if he would be open to Musk buying the platform.",
      "\"I would be if he wanted to buy it, yes,\" the president replied.",
      "\"I'd like Larry to buy it, too,\" Trump added, referring to Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, a long-time Trump supporter who was on stage with him for a separate announcement.",
      "Oracle is one of TikTok's main server providers, managing many of the data centres where billions of the platform's videos are stored.",
      "Last year, Oracle warned that a TikTok ban could hurt its business. The cloud computing giant was also a leading contender to buy the social media platform in 2020, back when Trump was trying to ban it.",
      "Billionaire investor Frank McCourt has also expressed interest in TikTok, and has been doing media interviews about the prospect for several months.",
      "McCourt has said he wants TikTok to run on technology overseen by the Project Liberty Institute, which he founded. He has been critical of data collection practices of social media companies.",
      "Project Liberty is bidding for TikTok without its proprietary algorithm. McCourt told CNBC this week that Project Liberty is \"not interested in the algorithm or the Chinese technology\" even as he acknowledged that the platform is \"worth less\" without it.",
      "Ultimately, President Trump is likely to have a major role in selecting a US buyer of TikTok.",
      "\"It's going to be a winner that's likely to be politically sympathetic to President Donald Trump,\" said Anupam Chander, a law professor at Georgetown University.",
      "Prof Chander said the 50-50 joint ownership model does not comport with the law's requirements, which might prompt Trump to pressure Congress into revising the law.",
      "For now, the platform's future remains in limbo.",
      "Prof Chander said the Biden administration made an \"unforced error\" by allowing the law to give the president outsized control over who owns TikTok.",
      "\"It was a terrible idea to put the future of a massive information platform into this political maelstrom,\" Prof Chander said."

    "story": [
      "More than 100 Reddit communities have banned users from posting links to X in protest at owner Elon Musk's controversial arm gesture at a rally celebrating Donald Trump's return to office.",
      "The billionaire twice extended his arm out straight as he thanked the crowd for \"making it happen.\"",
      "Critics, including some historians, said it was a Nazi salute - Mr Musk has dismissed that, saying comparisons with Hitler were \"tired\" and \"dirty tricks.\"",
      "However many Reddit users have been unpersuaded by his response describing his actions as \"hateful\", leading the moderators of scores of communities - or subreddits - to stop content being shared on X.",
      "X has not commented but Reddit has stressed there is no sitewide ban on X links, telling the BBC in a statement it \"has a longstanding commitment to freedom of speech and freedom of association\".",
      "However the platform relies heavily on community moderation, where unpaid individuals known as Redditors decide what is - and isn't - allowed to be published on their own corner of the website.",
      "In many instances, those Redditors have reached a different conclusion, deciding Mr Musk's actions were so offensive that they won't link to content from their subreddits on X, potentially reducing traffic, engagement and - ultimately - revenue.",
      "The biggest subreddits to have enforced the ban include basketball community r/NBA, which has 15 million members, female-focused community r/TwoXChromosomes, which has 14 million members, and American football community r/NFL, which has 12 million members.",
      "It is worth remembering that subreddits are almost always run by fans - it does not mean that the NFL or NBA organisations are taking a stance against Musk.",
      "The BBC has independently verified that at least 100 subreddits have banned X posts.",
      "Of this number, more than 60 have at least 100,000 members.",
      "But the actual number that have instituted the ban will likely be significantly higher by taking into account smaller subreddits with only a few thousand members.",
      "And there are many more communities discussing a potential blacklisting.",
      "Who and why?",
      "The subreddits run by fans of football clubs Liverpool, Celtic and Tottenham Hotspur have all instituted the bans, as have communities for many US sports sides as well as Formula 1.",
      "The subreddits where residents of many cities and countries gather around the world - ranging from New Jersey to South Korea - have also blocked posts to X.",
      "And gamers are also amongst those to bring in the ban for video games including Baldur's Gate 3 and World of Warcraft.",
      "But while the blacklisting may have first started in some of these communities, it is popping up in a variety of places now where people gather to discuss all sorts of topics, ranging from RuPaul's Drag Race to Disneyland and even the military.",
      "While the vast majority of subreddits discussing a ban are in favour of it, there are some that have refused.",
      "The moderators of the Maine community for example say they won't institute a ban so long as \"the state maintain official accounts there\".",
      "And those running a group for people in British Columbia said they simply aren't \"doing censorship here\".",
      "Does it matter?",
      "Though there are many subreddits which already disallow posts from social media, those built around professional sports in particular may have a big impact on referrals to X.",
      "That's because sports subreddits generally get a lot of content from links to athletes, analysts and journalists who spend a lot of time posting online.",
      "For example, the top two most popular posts of all time on the NBA subreddits are screenshots taken from X, while three of the top ten most popular posts of all time on the AEW wrestling subreddit are screenshots from the platform.",
      "And gaming subreddits have a similar story, with the top posts on the Animal Crossing and Kingdom Hearts communities both screenshots from X.",
      "But that is not to say the bans will necessarily be permanent - Reddit is known for this sort of community movement to protest against wider issues, which doesn't always work out.",
      "In 2023, thousands of communities \"went dark\" to contest changes to how the platform was being run.",
      "Some of the biggest Reddit communities then began only allowing photos and videos of comedian John Oliver, following comments from disgruntled users.",
      "But this proved to be short-lived.",

      "For now though the order creates a situation where the president is directly opposing a ruling made by the Supreme Court, which upheld the law to ban TikTok on 17 January.",
      "It said the ban was \"designed to prevent China - a designated foreign adversary - from leveraging its control over ByteDance to capture the personal data of US TikTok users\".",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:02:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Engineers are working on systems that can turn lunar regolith into useful elements like oxygen.",
    "story": [
      "Inside a giant sphere, the engineers pored over their equipment. Before them stood a silvery metal contraption swathed in colourful wires \u2013 a box that they hope will one day make oxygen on the moon.",
      "Once the team vacated the sphere, the experiment began. The box-like machine was now ingesting small quantities of a dusty regolith \u2013 a mixture of dust and sharp grit with a chemical composition mimicking real lunar soil.",
      "Soon, that regolith was gloop. A layer of it heated to temperatures above 1,650C. And, with the addition of some reactants, oxygen-containing molecules began to bubble out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve tested everything we can on Earth now,\u201d says Brant White, a program manager at Sierra Space, a private company. \u201cThe next step is going to the moon.\u201d",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s experiment unfolded at Nasa\u2019s Johnson Space Center in the summer of 2024. It is far from the only such technology that researchers are working on, as they develop systems that could supply astronauts living on a future lunar base.",
      "Those astronauts will need oxygen to breathe but also to make rocket fuel for spacecraft that might launch from the moon and head to destinations further afield \u2013 including Mars.",
      "Lunar base inhabitants might also require metal and they could even harvest this from the dusty grey debris that litters the lunar surface.",
      "Much depends on whether we can build reactors able to extract such resources effectively or not.",
      "\u201cIt could save billions of dollars from mission costs,\u201d says Mr White as he explains that the alternative \u2013 bringing lots of oxygen and spare metal to the moon from Earth \u2013 would be arduous and expensive.",
      "Luckily, the lunar regolith is full of metal oxides. But while the science of extracting oxygen from metal oxides, for example, is well understood on Earth, doing this on the moon is much harder. Not least because of the conditions.",
      "The huge spherical chamber that hosted Sierra Space\u2019s tests in July and August this year induced a vacuum and also simulated lunar temperatures and pressures.",
      "The company says it has had to improve how the machine works over time so that it can better cope with the extremely jagged, abrasive texture of the regolith itself. \u201cIt gets everywhere, wears out all sorts of mechanisms,\u201d says Mr White.",
      "And the one, crucial, thing that you can\u2019t test on Earth or even in orbit around our planet, is lunar gravity \u2013 which is roughly one sixth that of the Earth. It might not be until 2028 or later that Sierra Space can test its system on the moon, using real regolith in low gravity conditions.",
      "The moon\u2019s gravity could be a real problem for some oxygen-extracting technologies unless engineers design for it, says Paul Burke at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "In April, he and colleagues published a paper detailing the results of computer simulations that showed how a different oxygen-extracting process might be hindered by the moon\u2019s relatively feeble gravitational pull. The process under investigation here was molten regolith electrolysis, which involves using electricity to split lunar minerals containing oxygen, in order to extract the oxygen directly.",
      "The problem is that such technology works by forming bubbles of oxygen on the surface of electrodes deep within the molten regolith itself. \u201cIt is the consistency of, say, honey. It is very, very viscous,\u201d says Dr Burke.",
      "\u201cThose bubbles aren\u2019t going to rise as fast \u2013 and may actually be delayed from detaching from the electrodes.\u201d",
      "There could be ways around this. One could be to vibrate the oxygen-making machine device, which might jiggle the bubbles free.",
      "And extra-smooth electrodes might make it easier for the oxygen bubbles to detach. Dr Burke and his colleagues are now working on ideas like this.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s technology, a carbothermal process, is different. In their case, when oxygen-containing bubbles form in the regolith, they do so freely, rather than on the surface of an electrode. It means there is less chance of them getting stuck, says Mr White.",
      "Stressing the value of oxygen for future lunar expeditions, Dr Burke estimates that, per day, an astronaut would require the amount of oxygen contained in roughly two or three kilograms of regolith, depending on that astronaut\u2019s fitness and activity levels.",
      "However, a lunar base\u2019s life support systems would likely recycle oxygen breathed out by astronauts. If so, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to process quite as much regolith just to keep the lunar residents alive.",
      "The real use case for oxygen-extracting technologies, adds Dr Burke, is in providing the oxidiser for rocket fuels, which could enable ambitious space exploration.",
      "Obviously the more resources that can be made on the moon the better.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s system does require the addition of some carbon, though the firm says it can recycle most of this after each oxygen-producing cycle.",
      "Along with colleagues, Palak Patel, a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came up with an experimental molten regolith electrolysis system, for extracting oxygen and metal from the lunar soil.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really looking at it from the standpoint of, \u2018Let\u2019s try to minimise the number of resupply missions\u2019,\u201d she says.",
      "When designing their system, Ms Patel and her colleagues addressed the problem described by Dr Burke: that low gravity could impede the detachment of oxygen bubbles that form on electrodes. To counter this, they used a \u201csonicator\u201d, which blasts the bubbles with sound waves in order to dislodge them.",
      "Ms Patel says that future resource-extracting machines on the moon could derive iron, titanium or lithium from regolith, for example. These materials might help lunar-dwelling astronauts make 3D-printed spare parts for their moon base or replacement components for damaged spacecraft.",
      "The usefulness of lunar regolith does not stop there. Ms Patel notes that, in separate experiments, she has melted simulated regolith into a tough, dark, glass-like material.",
      "She and colleagues worked out how to turn this substance into strong, hollow bricks, which could be useful for building structures on the moon \u2013 an imposing black monolith, say. Why not?",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:01:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The founders of important open source software are getting older, who will take over?",
    "story": [
      "Many of us have prepared instructions and critical information for our family in the event of our sudden demise. For Daniel Stenberg, that includes passwords for his Google and GitHub accounts.",
      "That\u2019s because he\u2019s the founder of curl, an open source internet transfer engine that has been downloaded billions of times and is used to transfer data to and from computer servers.",
      "It was first released by Mr Stenberg in 1996 and is now used by millions ever day.",
      "It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away.",
      "\u201cI just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,\u201d Mr Stenberg says.",
      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work afterall.",
      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",
      "Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there\u2019s \u201cprobably less visceral enthusiasm\u201d for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.",
      "And, he continues, \u201cI've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, he says, there is a \u201cjoy, especially for a young person\u201d in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.",
      "\u201cThat feeling doesn't get old,\u201d he says. Even if the pioneers who popularized the earliest open source projects do.",

      "When the US barred the world's leading chip-makers such as Nvidia from selling advanced tech to China, it was certainly a blow.",
      "Those chips are essential for building powerful AI models that can perform a range of human tasks, from answering basic queries to solving complex maths problems.",
      "DeepSeek's founder Liang Wenfeng described the chip ban as their \"main challenge\" in interviews with local media.",
      "Long before the ban, DeepSeek acquired a \"substantial stockpile\" of Nvidia A100 chips - estimates range from 10,000 to 50,000 - according to the MIT Technology Review.",
      "Leading AI models in the West use an estimated 16,000 specialised chips. But DeepSeek says it trained its AI model using 2,000 such chips, and thousands of lower-grade chips - which is what makes its product cheaper.",
      "Some, including US tech billionaire Elon Musk, have questioned this claim, arguing the company cannot reveal how many advanced chips it really used given the restrictions.",
      "But experts say Washington's ban brought both challenges and opportunities to the Chinese AI industry.",

      "In a statement, lawyers for Mr Abramovich - who now reportedly divides his time between Istanbul, Tel Aviv and the Russian resort of Sochi - said he had \"always obtained independent expert professional tax and legal advice\" and \"acted in accordance\" with it.",
      "The billionaire, who was sanctioned by the UK in March 2022 over his connection to Vladimir Putin's regime, bought five luxury yachts over the course of the 2000s that were involved in the tax scheme.",
      "Among them was the 115m (377ft) Pelorus, which he reportedly lent to Chelsea footballer John Terry for his honeymoon in 2007 - and Eclipse, which at 162.5m (533ft) was once the largest private yacht in the world and worth an estimated $700m (\u00a3559m).",
      "The scheme to dodge tax on the yachts - and other secrets of the sanctioned oligarch's corporate empire - is laid bare in over 400,000 files and 72,000 emails leaked from a Cypriot corporate service provider, MeritServus.",
      "They show how MeritServus administered the oligarch's businesses through a global network of companies owned by a series of trusts of which Mr Abramovich was the beneficiary.",
      "The BBC and its media partners, including the Guardian, have been reporting on the leaked files since 2023 as part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' Cyprus Confidential investigation. We previously revealed Mr Abramovich's financial links to one of Mr Putin's closest associates, accused of holding the president's wealth.",
      "The files reveal how Mr Abramovich's advisers helped him avoid paying huge tax bills on the yachts' running costs in EU waters by using companies to hire them out to himself or other companies he controlled.",
      "Documents show how the five yachts were leased to a company in Cyprus called Blue Ocean Yacht Management, which chartered them on to a handful of companies in the British Virgin Islands that appeared independent - but which were all in fact controlled by Mr Abramovich.",
      "'Aware of the risks'",
      "The scheme to dodge VAT in Cyprus was set out in a revealing 2005 memorandum on the proposed \"Operating Structure\" for the management of Mr Abramovich's yachts.",
      "\"We want to avoid paying VAT on the purchase price of the yachts and where possible to avoid paying VAT on goods and services provided to the yachts,\" wrote the memo's author, Jonathan Holloway, then a director of Blue Ocean.",
      "You can hear File on 4 Investigates: Abramovich, the Yachts and the Tax Dodge on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on Tuesday 28 January and at 11:00 on Wednesday 29 January - or on BBC Sounds",
      "You can hear File on 4 Investigates: Abramovich, the Yachts and the Tax Dodge on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on Tuesday 28 January and at 11:00 on Wednesday 29 January - or on BBC Sounds",
      "Although Blue Ocean and the companies hiring the yachts were all owned by Mr Abramovich's trusts, they were intended to appear unconnected \"so that an investigator checking on our operation would see it as a legitimate structure\", Mr Holloway wrote in the memo he sent to some of Mr Abramovich's closest associates.",
      "Mr Holloway warned them they should be \"aware of the risks\". He wrote: \"We all have to recognise that a determined investigator could eventually discover this is an in-house structure with the possible consequences that would entail.\"",
      "Mr Holloway wrote that Blue Ocean, the companies to which it leased the yachts, and the ultimate \"customer\" should not have the same shareholders, directors or registered addresses, to avoid any \"common link\" that might arouse suspicion.",
      "As the memo noted, Mr Abramovich's lawyer had agreed to put the ownership of Blue Ocean into an entirely separate trust - apparently distancing it from the other companies.",
      "Sure enough, ownership of the yacht management company Blue Ocean was subsequently transferred from the oligarch's main trust to a new one, the Neptune Trust.",
      "'Hide the reality'",
      "The way Mr Abramovich's companies leased the yachts to each other, Prof Di Tanno told the BBC, was an \"artificial structure\" that evaded tax - a criminal offence.",
      "\"My conclusion is that in the case, there has been a tax evasion\u2026 because all the parties know exactly what to do in order to hide the reality,\" he said.",
      "Tax expert Rita de la Feria told the BBC she had seen in the yacht scheme \"indications\" that they \"may be misrepresenting information\".",
      "\"If that is the case, then we are now in the realm of evasion,\" she added.",
      "Mr Holloway, who stepped down as a director of Blue Ocean about 15 years ago, told the BBC that he \"joined Blue Ocean 20 years ago and was there for a relatively short period of time\".",
      "He said he had \"managed literally hundreds of vessels from many different locations around the world\". \"I can't be expected to remember the individual circumstances of every vessel I have ever managed,\" he said, adding that he \"used structures others in the industry were using\".",
      "Lawyers representing Mr Abramovich told the BBC he denied \"any allegation that he had any knowledge\" or was \"personally responsible\" or liable for \"any alleged deception of any government authority\" to evade tax.",
      "His lawyers said that just as Mr Abramovich sought professional legal and tax advice and acted on it, he expects that \"similar advice was sought at the relevant times by those with responsibility for the day-to-day running\" of the companies involved in the scheme.",
      "If this were a real superyacht leasing business, substantial profits might be expected. However Blue Ocean's accounts show that from 2005 to 2012, its expenses almost matched its income.",
      "This meant almost no corporation tax was due as the company's profits were tiny.",
      "A note from the Blue Ocean director suggests the close matching of expenses and income was no accident and the company would generate charters when the scheme needed to cover expenses.",
      "\"At the beginning of each week we will have a meeting in Blue Ocean where we will look at our current bank balances and our cash needs for the next 1~2 weeks [sic]. If we see a need for a cash injection we will raise an appropriate time charter and invoices,\" he wrote.",
      "There is also evidence in the leaked files that charter agreements were backdated. This includes a time charter agreement supposedly signed in July 2005 by Blue Ocean and another Abramovich company in the BVI called Eyke Services. However, records show Eyke Services did not exist at that point - it was not incorporated until a month later.",
      "In another case, a director of Blue Ocean requested the production of a backdated and signed time charter in order to obtain delivery of duty-free fuel for Mr Abramovich's 86m (282ft) yacht Ecstasea - which could accommodate 15 guests in eight suites - saving the billionaire $44,000 (\u00a335,000) in tax.",
      "In the documents, tax consultants from Deloitte in Cyprus wrote to Mr Holloway, the Blue Ocean director, saying if the ships were pleasure vessels, they would have to pay VAT. But if the vessels were classified as commercial, they would not.",
      "A leading superyacht lawyer Benjamin Maltby told the BBC the type of contracts used for many of Mr Abramovich's luxury yacht charters were actually designed for commercial ships carrying dry cargos such as grain or steel.",
      "This gives us more evidence that the whole commercial \"look\" of the operation was a sham.",
      "'Lawyers got onto it'",
      "Mr Abramovich's superyacht scheme came under legal scrutiny twice, with varying levels of success, the BBC and Bureau of Investigative Journalism has learned.",
      "Richard Bridge captained two of Mr Abramovich's yachts for almost six years from 2006 to 2012, including the Pelorus, and the giant Eclipse, the pride of Abramovich's fleet. A couple of years after he finished working for Mr Abramovich, the captain was stopped and questioned at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.",
      "Italian prosecutors had started proceedings against three of Mr Abramovich's captains - including Mr Bridge - for unpaid excise duties on refuelling and tax evasion.",
      "But Mr Bridge told the BBC he had contacted Blue Ocean and \"their lawyers got onto it\", telling him a few months later the case had been dropped.",
      "Italian court records seen by the BBC show proceedings were halted after the lawyers \"produced documentation\" proving Pelorus was \"entered in the registers as a commercial boat as it is used for commercial purposes or for hire\".",
      "Mr Bridge said he was unaware Mr Abramovich also controlled the companies that were chartering the yachts.",
      "In Cyprus, tax officials were separately investigating Blue Ocean over up to \u20ac17m (\u00a314.3m) in unpaid VAT, disputing the company's claim to be \"zero-rated\" for VAT because it was a commercial operation.",
      "Blue Ocean's lawyers said demands to provide evidence the vessels had been used commercially by the companies chartering them were \"unreasonable and oppressive\", but they had asked its clients anyway and received no response.",
      "We now know that Blue Ocean's clients were, of course, Mr Abramovich's other companies.",
      "According to an appeal judgement in 2018, VAT investigators found Blue Ocean had failed to present any evidence the companies chartering the yachts were \"engaged in economic activity\" and its claim that the boats were used for commercial purposes was rejected.",
      "In the end, Cyprus pursued Blue Ocean for the lower figure of \u20ac14m (\u00a311.8m).",
      "We do not know if the sum was paid - the company failed to attend its own appeal in March 2024 and was dissolved four months later.",

      "Laurence des Cars issued the stark warning in a leaked letter to the government raising the alarm over power-cuts, flooding, and failing infrastructure.",
      "She said that the famous glass pyramid \u2013 which since 1989 has housed the unique access point to the galleries \u2013 was \"structurally unable to cope\", and that Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, which is seen by 20,000 people every day, may have to be moved.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, who has taken a personal interest in the museum's problems, will visit the Louvre on Tuesday amid speculation he may announce a new investment plan.",
      "However his powers have been significantly curtailed since he lost control of parliament six months ago, and the precarious state of France's finances \u2013 with the 2025 budget still in dispute \u2013 makes any big financial commitment highly contentious.",
      "According to Christian Galani of Louvre employees' trade union, \"not a day goes by without some new sign of the building's decline \u2013 paint flaking, exhibition and storage rooms flooded, power-cuts, late-payments to contractors because there's no money.\"",
      "In November 2023 a temporary exhibition in the Sully wing had to be moved after just a few days because of a flood.",
      "Big variations in temperature \u2013 from 10C in winter to 30C in summer \u2013 cause discomfort to staff and visitors, as well as posing a threat to the conservation of art-works.",
      "The temperature problem is most starkly felt in the pyramid of architect Ieoh Ming Pei, which was designed to cope with four million annual visitors but today faces more than double that. Every day some 30,000 people pass through the turnstiles, making the Louvre the most visited museum in the world.",
      "In her letter, Laurence des Cars raised the need for better toilets, caf\u00e9s and rest areas. She also said that \"in the view of everyone, the presentation of the Mona Lisa... is something that needs to be looked at.\"",
      "Around three-quarters of the museum's visitors go to see Leonardo da Vinci's painting, but the experience has become a trial, with a constant crowd being funnelled through the Salle des Etats and getting on average 50 seconds to observe the picture and take photos.",
      "\"The public... has no way of comprehending the artist's work, which raises questions over our whole mission of public service,\" Ms des Cars said.",
      "Among the options under consideration is the opening of a new entrance to the Louvre beneath the colonnades at the palace's eastern end. Currently there is a large open space here, with an empty moat that is not original but was created in the 1960s.",
      "By digging underground at the moat, and in the neighbouring Cour Carr\u00e9e, new spaces could be created to ease congestion, improve facilities, and possibly house a re-located Mona Lisa. Another option for the painting would be to remove it from the main collection and require visitors to pay an extra fee.",
      "The Louvre received a state subsidy of \u20ac96m (\u00a380m) in 2024. In 2023 it had receipts of \u20ac161m from tickets and events, as well as \u20ac83m from its sponsorship arrangement with the Louvre Abu Dhabi.",

    "title": "Backlash in Kenya over livestock vaccines and belching cows",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:33:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Why there is growing scepticism in Kenya over a plan to vaccinate the national herd.",
    "story": [
      "An ambitious initiative to vaccinate all livestock in Kenya is due to kick off this week amid fierce resistance from farmers that is being driven by misleading claims about the vaccines.",
      "It will cost farmers nothing to get their animals vaccinated as the government says it is footing the bill.",
      "But Robert Nkukuu, who keeps cattle in the Mai Mahiu area of Nakuru county - some 50km (30 miles) north-west of the capital, Nairobi, explained how it had become a toxic issue since President William Ruto announced the plan last November.",
      "\"If the community here learns you are pro-vaccination they will slay you just now. So stop talking about it, we don't want it,\" he told the BBC.",
      "The government's aim is to vaccinate at least 22 million cattle and 50 million goats and sheep over three years.",
      "Currently only 10% of the national herd get the necessary vaccinations and the authorities say they want to raise that rate to 85% to make Kenya's livestock products eligible for export.",
      "The president, who is a farm owner and has several big herds himself, has said the vaccines are vital for expanding the sector by controlling foot-and-mouth disease in cattle and peste des petits ruminants (PPR) - also known as sheep and goat plague.",
      "But some of those who oppose the programme believe Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is funding it, fuelled by people sharing videos of interviews featuring him talking about vaccinating cows to control methane emissions.",
      "Methane expelled by livestock belching and farting contributes about 15% of global emissions each year, UN estimates show. It is the most common greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide (CO2).",
      "Jonathan Mueke, a senior official in Kenya's agriculture ministry, has denied that Gates is involved in the livestock vaccination programme - adding that neither the US billionaire and philanthropist nor other foreign sources have provided funding.",
      "But this has not stopped the conspiracy theories being circulated on social media, often by high-profile personalities.",
      "Caleb Karuga, a former journalist and now an influential farmer, posted on X that he would resist the jabs, saying no-one will vaccinate his livestock just \"because Bill Gates said so\".",
      "Ledama Olekina, an opposition senator and prominent Maasai pastoralist, wrote on X: \"There [are] millions of cows in Europe and America and none of them are being vaccinated for farting \u2026 mine will not be vaccinated.\"",
      "Gates has previously invested in projects to reduce methane emissions from cattle and is funding a US-based company looking to develop a vaccine, as are other US investors.",
      "But Prof Ermias Kebreab from the University of California, Davis in the US, who has researched how to reduce methane emissions from livestock, told the BBC there was currently no livestock vaccine for reducing methane emissions in use.",
      "\"I wish we had one but that is still in development - and no-one has reached [the stage of] testing in animals yet,\" he said.",
      "However, such assurances have done little to quell misunderstanding about the motives of the vaccine campaign.",
      "The distrust is being pushed by some opposition politicians, who have said the vaccines will alter the genetic make-up of livestock, potentially resulting in defective animals.",
      "\"Ruto is advancing a sinister foreign agenda. This plan is reckless and must be stopped,\" said Kalonzo Musyoka, an opposition leader, not long after the initiative was announced.",
      "When the BBC asked Musyoka about the specific claims that the vaccines could be harmful to the cattle, his spokesperson said the vaccination campaign was a \"violation of the constitution\".",
      "He added that it had been \"shrouded in secrecy\" and the government had not shared details about resources, implementation or technical details about the vaccines.",
      "The suggestion that livestock vaccines will genetically change animals is misleading, according to Prof Ermias.",
      "\"It is very similar to people getting vaccinated to fight against various diseases. There is no report that it causes deformities or alters DNA,\" the academic told the BBC.",
      "President Ruto has dismissed the views of those opposing the vaccinations as \"simply misguided, unreasonable and possibly stupid\".",
      "\"All of us who have been vaccinated, has anyone stopped farting?\" Ruto said as he dismissed the methane claims as \"nonsense\".",
      "Yet analysts say the spread of such conspiracy theories is down to poor communication by Ruto himself as well as low trust in his government following anti-tax protests last year and a series of corruption scandals.",
      "The government has faced a huge backlash over tax increases brought in since Ruto became president in 2022 - making it very unpopular. Last June it was forced to withdraw a controversial finance bill that would have included more tax increases.",
      "Alphonce Shiundu, Kenya editor at fact-checking organisation AfricaCheck, says the government was now facing a \"trust deficiency\" in the way it communicated the livestock campaign.",
      "When Ruto first announced it, details were scant - and it was not clear what the animals would be vaccinated against.",
      "This is when tools that monitor social media posts on X show there was a clear spike in mentions of both Gates and cows by accounts with their location listed as Kenya.",
      "The furore grew into a matter of national debate, with cartoonists even pushing for cows' rights on social media with comical images captioned \"my fart, my choice\".",
      "The Kenya Veterinary Association (KVA) has called on the government to halt the vaccination exercise and conduct a public awareness campaign first.",
      "\"The politicisation of the vaccination exercise has adversely affected the entire campaign, thus distracting the public from the goal of controlling diseases,\" Dr Kelvin Osore, KVA chairperson, told the BBC.",
      "But Dr Allan Azegele, the director of veterinary services at the agriculture ministry, said it could not be delayed given the recent severe outbreak of foot-and-mouth in western areas.",
      "This has forced several livestock markets to close this month - and the authorities have imposed strict quarantine measures in those places.",
      "\"We cannot wait\u2026 because it is more expensive to respond to outbreaks. We have to be proactive rather than reactive,\" Dr Azegele told the BBC.",
      "He said foot-and-mouth had no specific treatment, making prevention through vaccination crucial.",
      "Agriculture Minister Mutahi Kagwe has sought to reassure everyone that the exercise will be voluntary and has pledged to engage all stakeholders to \"cure misinformation\" surrounding the issue.",
      "The government has also been reassuring the public that the vaccines are being produced locally.",
      "But some farmers are still vowing to resist the vaccination drive, citing possible foreign influence and mistrust of the government.",
      "David Tiriki, a livestock farmer in Kajiado county, south of Nairobi, told the BBC that he would not allow his animals to be inoculated, citing safety fears.",
      "\"I suspect someone is trying to introduce a virus to our livestock so that the rich can start selling the cure to poor farmers who might not even afford it,\" he said.",
      "The BBC did speak to one small-scale farmer from Makueni county, south-east of Nairobi, who welcomed the initiative.",
      "But Ngemu Musau urged the government to make the whole process more transparent.",
      "\"I want assurance that my cattle will be OK after the vaccine,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"There is a need for the government to conduct intensive public awareness campaigns.\"",

    "summary": "The lawyers were part of former special counsel Jack Smith's team which brought two cases against the president.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump's administration has fired more than a dozen justice department lawyers who worked on two criminal cases against him.",
      "They were fired after Acting Attorney General James McHenry concluded they could not \"be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president\", a department official told the BBC's US partner CBS News.",
      "The lawyers were part of former special counsel Jack Smith's team which investigated Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and his alleged attempt to overturn his 2020 election defeat.",
      "The firings on Monday are effective immediately.",
      "Mr Smith was appointed as special counsel in 2022 to oversee the two justice department cases into Trump. The president had vowed to fire him \"within two seconds\" of taking office, but he quit before his inauguration.",
      "Both cases resulted in criminal charges against Trump, who pleaded not guilty.",
      "But the cases were closed following his November election win. Prosecutors wrote that justice department regulations do not allow the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "It was not immediately clear which members of Mr Smith's team were fired.",
      "Many of those who worked on Mr Smith's teams were career corruption and national security prosecutors who had worked across various administrations and were appointed to the cases.",
      "They reportedly received a letter on Monday which said their role in investigating and prosecuting the president made them unsuitable to work in the department.",
      "\"Firing prosecutors because of cases they were assigned to work on is just unacceptable,\" former US Attorney Joyce Vance told NBC News. \"It's anti-rule of law; it's anti-democracy.\"",
      "The firings follow a major reassignment of some of the justice department's top officials with expertise in a wide range of fields including national security and public corruption. On Monday, one of them, the chief of the public integrity section, reportedly resigned.",
      "Trump and his team have accused the justice department of pursuing politically motivated cases against him, his associates and Republicans. Trump vowed an immediate overhaul of the department, which he says has been \"weaponised\" against him, while campaigning for re-election.",
      "His nominee to lead the justice department, Pam Bondi, has echoed Trump's view that federal prosecutions against him were political persecution, saying the department \"had been weaponised for years and years and years\".",
      "Mr Smith has publicly defended his work. In a letter accompanying the final draft of his report into Trump's actions after the 2020 election, he wrote: \"The claim from [Trump] that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable.\"",
      "Also on Monday, Washington DC's top federal prosecutor announced the launch of an internal review into the charging decisions behind hundreds of Capitol riot cases, according to CBS.",
      "Acting US Attorney Edward Martin, a Trump appointee, ordered prosecutors in his office to turn in documents, emails and other information related to the previous administration's decision to bring an obstruction charge against more than 200 Capitol attack defendants."

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed several executive orders focused on reshaping the US military.",
      "One order signed late on Monday bans diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the military. It will remove the use of race- or sex-based preferences in the armed forces, the Defense Department and the Homeland Security Department.",
      "Another reinstates more than 8,000 service members who were discharged for refusing to get the Covid-19 vaccine.",
      "The White House added that a third executive order tasks officials with formulating a policy on transgender troops. The action does not immediately ban transgender service members.",
      "A fourth order mandates a process to develop an \"American Iron Dome\" - similar to the one used by Israel in the Middle East; while the White House says a proclamation has been signed to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.",
      "The executive orders were signed by Trump on board Air Force One.",
      "Removing DEI programmes from within the federal government was one of Trump's central campaign promises - and one he has moved swiftly to implement upon taking office last week.",
      "DEI programmes aim to promote participation in workplaces by people from a range of backgrounds.",
      "Their backers say they address historical underrepresentation and discrimination against certain groups, including racial minorities, but critics say such programmes can themselves be discriminatory.",
      "The Trump administration claims that removing these initiatives from the US military will help boost recruitment levels.",
      "Defence officials have previously said that the military services collectively missed recruitment goals by 41,000 personnel in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has promised to eliminate similar initiatives from the military, telling reporters on Monday that \"there are more executive orders coming\".",
      "Removing DEI from the military",
      "The order entitled \"restoring America's fighting force\" includes a ban on what the administration considers discriminatory race or sex-based preferences by any branch of the military, Department of Defense or the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Additionally, any remaining DEI-related bureaucracy will be eliminated from those departments., the document said.",
      "Within 90 days of the executive order being signed, the President says the Secretary of Defense will carry out \"an internal review that documents actions taken in pursuit of DEI initiatives, including all instances of race and sex discrimination and activities designed to promote a race- or sex-based preferences system\".",
      "It remains unclear what specific programmes will be affected by the order.",
      "In a December 2020 report, the department's Board on Diversity and Inclusion recommended a number of steps, including the removal of \"aptitude test barriers that adversely impact diversity\" and incorporating the \"value of cultivating diversity and inclusion\" into leadership and professionalism curricula.",
      "Over the weekend, it was reported that the US Air Force was reviewing material on the role of black and female pilots during World War Two from its training programmes as part of an effort to comply with Trump's DEI orders.",
      "But on Sunday, military officials clarified that certain curricula will not be removed from basic military training.",
      "During the campaign in June, Trump said the military's purpose is \"to win wars, not to be woke\".",
      "Hegseth told reporters on Monday that the job of the military is \"lethality and readiness and war fighting\".",
      "\"Military training will be focused on the readiness of what our troops in the field need to deter our enemies,\" he added.",
      "The move forms part of a larger, government-wide effort to remove DEI practices from the federal workforce.",
      "Immediately after taking office, Trump ordered that all US government staff working on DEI schemes were to be put on immediate paid administrative leave.",
      "The White House gave them until 17:00 EST (2200 GMT) the following day to be put on leave before the offices and programmes in question were shut down.",
      "In an order, Trump said that the programmes were \"dangerous, demeaning and immoral\".",
      "On Monday, the Department of Veterans Affairs also said it had has placed almost 60 employees on leave as it works to implement Trump's order last week to eliminate DEI from federal workplaces.",
      "In a statement, the department said that the salary of the employees - who were solely focused on DEI initiatives - were collectively paid about $8m, an average of about $136,000 (\u00a3109,000) per year. One employee was making over $220,000 a year.",

      "About 8,000 US military personnel were discharged from service for refusing the vaccines between 2021 and 2023 - of which only 43 were reinstated before Trump's return to the White House.",

      "The official called the reinstatement of the troops \"concerning\" and said he feared it could create a precedent to be able to opt out of other vaccines, such as those given to service members for yellow fever or smallpox."

    "summary": "The app spooked the markets as well as the bullish sense of American superiority in AI development.",
    "story": [
      "The speed at which the new Chinese AI app DeepSeek has shaken the technology industry, the markets and the bullish sense of American superiority in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been nothing short of stunning.",
      "Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen may have said it best. \"DeepSeek-R1 is AI's Sputnik moment,\" he posted to X on Sunday, referring to the satellite which kicked off the space race.",
      "DeepSeek was the most downloaded free app on Apple's US App Store over the weekend. By Monday, the new AI chatbot had triggered a massive sell-off of major tech stocks which were in freefall as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Shares of AI chip designer and recent Wall Street darling Nvidia, for example, had plunged by 17% by the time US markets closed on Monday. Or to put it in even starker terms, it lost nearly $600bn in market value which, according to Bloomberg, is the biggest drop in the history of the US stock market.",
      "This extraordinary, historic spooking can largely be attributed to something as simple as cost. And a claim by DeepSeek's developers which prompted serious questions in Silicon Valley.",
      "While ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has been haemorrhaging money - spending $5bn last year alone - DeepSeek's developers say it built this latest model for a mere $5.6m.",

      "HANDS ON: Is DeepSeek as good as it seems?",
      "As this dramatic moment for the sector played out, there was a palpable silence in many corners of Silicon Valley when I contacted those who are usually happy to talk. Many observers, investors, and analysts appeared stunned.",
      "Some wondered if this marked a buying opportunity. Others questioned the information DeepSeek was providing.",
      "\"I still think the truth is below the surface when it comes to actually what's going on,\" veteran analyst Gene Munster told me on Monday. He questioned the financials DeepSeek is citing, and wondered if the startup was being subsidised or whether its numbers were correct.",
      "The chatbot is \"surprisingly good, which just makes it hard to believe\", he said.",
      "Regardless, DeepSeek's sudden arrival is a \"flex\" by China and a \"black eye for US tech,\" to use his own words.",
      "It was just last week, after all, that OpenAI's Sam Altman and Oracle's Larry Ellison joined President Donald Trump for a news conference that really could have been a press release.",
      "The event represented peak American bullishness on AI.",
      "They announced Stargate, a joint venture that promises up to $500bn in private investment for AI infrastructure: data centres in Texas and beyond, along with a promised 100,000 new jobs.",
      "The US seemed to think its abundant data centres and control over the highest-end chips gave it a commanding lead in AI, despite China's dominance in rare-earth metals and engineering talent.",
      "Some have even seen it as a foregone conclusion that America would dominate the AI race, despite some high-profile warnings from top executives who said the country's advantages should not be taken for granted.",
      "The US may still go on to command the sector, but there is a sense that DeepSeek has shaken some of that swagger.",
      "Trump's words after the Chinese app's sudden emergence in recent days were probably cold comfort to the likes of Altman and Ellison. He called this moment a \"wake-up call\" for the American tech industry, and said finding a way to do cheaper AI is ultimately a \"good thing\".",
      "It is also worth noting that it was not just tech stocks that took a beating on Monday. Energy stocks did too. DeepSeek's arrival on the scene has upended many assumptions we have long held about what it takes to develop AI.",
      "Maybe that nuclear renaissance - including firing up America's Three Mile Island energy plant once again - won't be needed. Maybe it does not take so much capital, compute, and power after all.",
      "For now, the future of semiconductor giants like Nvidia remains unclear.",
      "DeepSeek says its model was developed with existing technology along with open source software that can be used and shared by anybody for free.",
      "But WIRED reports that for years, DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfung's hedge fund High-Flyer has been stockpiling the chips that form the backbone of AI \u2013 known as GPUs, or graphics processing units.",
      "The company has said its models deployed H800 chips made by Nvidia. US policy restricting sales of higher-powered chips to China might get a second-look under the new Trump administration.",

      "It gives long answers and will not be drawn on expressing an opinion, however directly it is asked for one.",
      "The chatbot often begins its response by saying the topic is \"highly subjective\" \u2013 whether that is politics (is Donald Trump a good US president?) or soft drinks (which is more tasty, Pepsi or Coke?).",
      "It wouldn't even commit to saying whether or not it was better than OpenAI's rival artificial intelligence (AI) assistant ChatGPT, but it did weigh up the pros and cons of both - ChatGPT did exactly the same, and even used very similar language.",
      "DeepSeek says it was trained on data up to October 2023, and while the app seems to have access to current information such as today's date, the website version does not.",
      "That is not dissimilar to earlier versions of ChatGPT and is probably a similar attempt at safeguarding \u2013 to stop the chatbot spewing out misinformation pumped onto the web in real time.",

    "story": [
      "Teddy bears \u2013 large and small - are clustered around the grave of Adam Buhayov as if keeping him company.",
      "But the 17-month-old is not alone. His mother Sophiia Buhayova, 27, is buried in the grave with him, in a bleak and windswept cemetery in Ukraine's southern city of Zaporizhzhia.",
      "Adam's great-grandmother, Tetiana Tarasevych, 68, is in the grave right beside them.",
      "All three were killed together on 7 November last year by a Russian attack in a war that has devoured Ukraine since 2022 \u2013 but which no longer dominates the international agenda.",
      "Some of Adam's last moments were captured by Tetiana in a video on her phone. The two of them were out on a walk with Adam's mum Sophiia. Blond-haired, blue-eyed Adam wears a red anorak and a woollen hat, with a Mickey Mouse sticker on the front. \"Don't take off your hat,\" Tetiana tells him gently, \"you will be cold\".  He does it anyway.",
      "One hour later the trio were at home, about to get a bite to eat, when a Russian guided aerial bomb sliced through their block of flats. Adam, Sophiia and Tetiana were killed, along with six other civilians.",
      "Sophiia's mother Yuliia Tarasevych, 46, now struggles to carry on - without most of her family, without her past and her future.",
      "She is slight, and swamped by a heavy black coat and by grief.",
      "\"I don't know how to live,\" she says. \"It's hell on earth. I lost my mother, my daughter, and my grandson in one second.\" The closest she can get to them now is at their graves.",
      "\"My dear Mum,\" she says weeping, and stroking a photograph of Tetiana \u2013 a doctor like her - attached to a wooden cross. One step brings her to the grave of Sophiia and Adam. She leans down to touch his photo, calling him \"my little kitten\".",
      "Then she speaks directly to a photo of Sophiia - a black and white image of a young woman with long dark hair. \"My beautiful daughter,\" she cries, \"I am sorry I could not save you.\"",
      "Sophiia's father, 60-year-old Serhiy Lushchay, is by her side - a robust figure who shares her loss and her sorrow. \"We visit the graveyard often,\" Yuliia says, \"and we will as long as we live, because it truly makes it a little easy for us\".",
      "Every time they come, there are more graves stretching out into the distance. The cemetery is expanding \"at a staggering pace,\" Yuliia says. Rows of blue and yellow flags, marking the graves of fallen soldiers, pierce the sombre grey sky.",
      "Zaporizhzhia, where the family lived, is a regular target for Russian forces. It is a strategically important industrial city, near front-line fighting. Europe's largest nuclear power plant \u2013 about 55km (34 miles) from the city \u2013 is held by the Russians.",
      "On the day of the attack that killed Sophiia, Tetiana and Adam, Yuliia called her daughter from western Ukraine, where she was on a work trip.",
      "\"I told her to be careful. Bombs had been falling over the city since the morning. She said: 'Thank you mum, don't worry. Everything will be fine with us.'\"",
      "Serhiy was at work when he heard something had happened. He too called his daughter, but there was no reply.",
      "Then, on his local residents' WhatsApp group he saw a message saying: \"Friends, who else is still left under the rubble?\"",
      "\"I rushed home praying all the way,\" he says, \"but my prayers were already in vain\".",
      "\"When I arrived, all I saw was ruins. I wandered around looking for my balcony. I don't know how much time passed \u2013 two or three hours \u2013 and I realised there was nothing left, and no hope of rescue.\"",
      "In the days that followed some belongings were reclaimed from the rubble - a china cup of Sophiia's, somehow unbroken, a toy fish Adam played with in the bath, and the little red jacket he wore on his last walk. These are now family treasures, along with many precious memories.",
      "\"Every evening when I came home from work, I would take Adam for a walk,\" says Serhiy. \"He was very curious about the sky. He'd point his little finger up, and we'd tell him about it. And he loved birds.\"",
      "Another family video shows Adam hoisted in Sophiia's arms, being swung from side to side, and then running around on the ground, surrounded by pigeons. \"He had almost started talking,\" Yuliia says, \"and he was always smiling. He was healthy, beautiful and smart. He and my daughter made us happy every day\".",
      "After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Yuliia had taken Sophiia to safety in the UK.",
      "The young woman put her language skills to use, working as a translator for Ukrainian troops being trained by the British military, but she could not stay away from Ukraine.",
      "\"She really missed her parents and her relatives and the country,\" Yuliia says. Sophiia returned and later gave birth to Adam in June 2023.  She also took up psychology because \"she knew a lot of people in Ukraine needed psychological help,\" her mother says.",
      "In the midst of her grief, Yuliia knows that Ukraine may soon come under pressure to negotiate with the enemy that robbed her of so much.",
      "President Trump is back into the White House \u2013 all guns blazing -  pushing for peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv. But both Yuliia and Serhiy are adamant that Ukraine must fight on. She tells me Donald Trump's claim that he could end the war in a day was \"funny to hear\".",
      "\"Russia is an aggressor, that came to our country, and destroyed our homes, and our families,\" Yuliia says. \"So, there can be no talk of any ceasefire or peace talks. If we leave this glutton [Russian President Vladimir Putin] with our territories and do not avenge the people we lost, we will never win.\"",
      "Serhiy says the only contact with Russians on Ukrainian territory should be through combat.",
      "Many Ukrainians believe that even if there is a ceasefire, Russia will come back for more sooner or later \u2013 as it did in 2022, eight years after annexing the Crimean Peninsula. Moscow now controls almost one fifth of Ukraine.",
      "Time is not on Ukraine's side. In 2025 there is danger on several fronts - a lack of manpower, a possible reduction in future US military aid, and fading international attention.",
      "Yuliia accepts that life goes on in other countries.",
      "\"People can't live in constant stress, thinking only about us,\" she says.",
      "\"Still, I would like them to remember that there's a war happening nearby, where not only soldiers but also civilians are dying.\"",

After the German invasion and occupation of Poland in 1939, the Nazis started deporting Jewish people from the Third Reich to parts of Poland, where they created ghettos to separate them from the rest of the population.",

      "Behind the lines, Nazi commanders were experimenting with ways to kill en masse. They feared that shooting people was too stressful for their soldiers, and so came up with more efficient means of murder.",
      "Experimental gas vans had been used to kill mentally disabled people in Poland as early as 1939. Poisonous fumes were pumped into a sealed compartment to suffocate those inside. By the winter of 1941, the Nazis had constructed their first gas chamber and crematorium at Auschwitz.",
      "Nazi leaders met in January 1942 at the Wannsee Conference to coordinate the industrial slaughter - what they called a \"final solution to the Jewish question\" - killing the entire European Jewish population, 11 million people, by extermination and forced labour.",
      "What was Auschwitz?",
      "Auschwitz was originally a Polish army barracks in southern Poland. Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Poland in September 1939, and by May 1940 turned the site into a jail for political prisoners.",
      "The Nazi officer made commandant of the concentration camp, Rudolf H\u00f6ss, brought the motto Arbeit Macht Frei - works sets you free - from another camp where he had worked, at Dachau in Germany.",

      "The first people to be gassed were a group of Polish and Soviet prisoners in September 1941.",
      "Work began on a new camp, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, the following month. This became the site of the huge gas chambers where hundreds of thousands were murdered prior to November 1944, and the crematoria where their bodies were burned.",
      "Birkenau was to become the biggest of six Nazi death camps. Three others, at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka, were also completed in 1942.",
      "The first transport of Jews to Auschwitz II-Birkenau was 999 women and girls from Slovakia in March 1942, immediately followed by deportations from France, and later the Netherlands and Belgium. By 1944, 12,000 Jews were being murdered every day.",
      "German chemicals company IG Farben built and operated a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III-Monowitz. Other private companies like Krupp and Siemens-Schuckert also ran factories nearby, to use the prisoners as slave labour. Both Primo Levi and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel survived Monowitz concentration camp.",
      "When Auschwitz was eventually liberated, it had more than 40 camps and subcamps.",
      "How did Auschwitz work?",
      "People from all over Europe were crammed into cattle wagons without windows, toilets, seats or food, and transported to Auschwitz.",
      "There they were sorted into those who could work and those who were to be immediately killed.",
      "The latter group were ordered to strip naked and sent to the showers for \"delousing\" - a euphemism used for the gas chambers.",
      "Guards used Zyklon B pellets to murder people in the gas chambers",
      "Nazis cremated victims in ovens",
      "Guards from the so-called \"Hygienic Institute\" would then drop powerful Zyklon-B gas pellets into the sealed chambers, and wait for people to die. It took about 20 minutes. The thick walls could not hide the screams of those suffocating inside.",
      "Then Sonderkommandos - other prisoners, usually Jews forced to work for the guards or be killed - would remove artificial limbs, glasses, hair and teeth before dragging the corpses to the incinerators. Ashes of the bodies were buried or used as fertiliser.",
      "Belongings of those gassed and those sent to work were taken for sorting in a part of the camp known as \"Canada\" - so named because the country was seen as a land of plenty.",
      "Who were the victims?",
      "SS guards sought to hide their crimes as Soviet troops closed in, and tried to destroy their extensive prisoner records - making it hard to fully quantify the number of victims.",

      "Jews from all across Nazi-controlled Europe made up the vast majority of the victims. Almost one million Jewish people were murdered at Auschwitz.",

      "So many Hungarian Jewish people were killed in such a short time that victims' bodies were dropped in pits near the camp and burned",
      "Tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews were sent to Auschwitz every day. Three quarters of them were killed on arrival.",
      "Some 75,000 Polish civilians, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, 25,000 Roma and Sinti, as well as Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals and political prisoners were also put to death by the German state at the Auschwitz complex.",
      "What happened when Auschwitz was liberated?",
      "German authorities ordered a halt to gassing and the destruction of the gas chambers and crematoria in late 1944, as Soviet troops advanced westward. The stockpile of stolen valuables in the Canada sector was shipped to Germany shortly afterwards.",
      "Determined to erase the evidence of their crimes, the Nazis ordered 56,000 remaining prisoners to march west to other concentration camps, such as Bergen-Belsen, Dachau and Sachsenhausen. Those too sick to walk were left behind; any who fell behind on the march itself were killed.",
      "Soviet forces found only a few thousand survivors when they entered the camp on 27 January 1945, along with hundreds of thousands of clothes and several tonnes of human hair. Soldiers later recalled having to convince some survivors that the Nazis had truly gone.",
      "Elie Wiesel later said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of the liberation, external that the Nazi crimes at Auschwitz \"produced a mutation on a cosmic scale, affecting man's dreams and endeavours\".",

      "\"I just felt like a new person on them,\" she said.",
      "But she worried about the same obstacle facing many of her patients - losing insurance coverage - so she tapered off the drugs as a precaution.",

Federal law bans Medicare from covering the drugs when used for weight loss, though they usually are covered when used to treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Only 13 states provide coverage under Medicaid for weight loss purposes.",

      "The Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment about how it would handle the Biden administration's proposal for Medicare - federal insurance for those 65 and older - and Medicaid - government insurance for low-income people - to cover the drugs.",
      "Trump's future approach remains unclear, with several people in his inner circle holding contradictory views, said Jonathan Zhang, a professor at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy.",
      "\"GLP-1, Ozempic, this is a drug that has so much patient demand,\" Mr Zhang said. \"It's really taken on a life of its own on social media. So the Trump administration - or any administration - faces a tonne of pressure to do something about this in the near term.\"",

      "After dropping out and endorsing Trump, Kennedy launched his \"Make America Healthy Again\" initiative to reduce obesity by eliminating ultra-processed foods and additives, among other more controversial ideas.",
      "But the 71-year-old has been outspoken about weight-loss drugs, telling Fox News in October: \"They're counting on selling [weight-loss medications] to Americans because we're so stupid and so addicted to drugs.\"",
      "\"If we just gave good food, three meals a day, to every man, woman and child in our country, we could solve the obesity and diabetes epidemic overnight,\" Kennedy added.",
      "Shortly after Trump chose Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), he announced that he selected Oz, a former TV show host and surgeon, to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), an agency within HHS that administers the government health insurance.",
      "As a television show host, Oz spent years promoting various weight-loss drugs,  including more recently, GLP-1 drugs.",
      "\"For those who want to lose a few pounds, Ozempic and other semaglutide medications can be a big help,\" Oz posted on Instagram in 2023. \"We need to make it as easy as possible for people to meet their health goals, period.\"",
      "Decisions about Medicare and Medicaid drug coverage would likely involve leaders from both HHS and CMS, experts said.",
      "Spokespeople for Oz and Kennedy did not respond to requests for comment about how they would handle the policy decision. Neither has been confirmed to their appointments yet.",
      "An 'enormous' cost",
      "The high price of GLP-1 drugs - which are patented, meaning cheaper copycat versions can't be made - has led to a debate among insurance companies, said Benjamin Rome, a health policy researcher at Harvard Medical School.",
      "The companies have to decide whether to raise insurance premiums, in general, to cover the costs, or to forgo coverage of GLP-1s altogether, he said.",
      "Many have decided not to cover them. Others cut off coverage to patients once they lose weight and reach a body mass index (BMI) below the obesity range of 30 or higher, Dr Cecil said.",
      "When Dr Cecil was on a GLP-1 using her previous insurance, she said she wouldn't allow herself to lose as much weight as she wanted to avoid crossing the BMI threshold.",
      "\"They'll cut off coverage, saying, 'Well, you don't need it anymore. You've lost weight.' But of course, the reason they lost weight is because of the medicine,\" she said.",
      "Getting off anti-obesity drugs too quickly also can cause unpleasant withdrawal effects, and many gain back the weight.",
      "Government insurance faces a similar cost predicament when it comes to covering the new weight-loss medications.",
      "\"Although there's obviously a lot of interest in doing so to make these highly effective drugs more available to patients who need them, the cost of doing so would be enormous because so many people are eligible and because the prices are so high,\" Dr Rome said.",
      "When Biden officials issued the rule requiring Medicare and Medicaid to cover the anti-obesity medications, they did so after the election, knowing it would not be up to them to carry the policy out, said Mark Fendrick, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Value-Based Insurance Design.",
      "The federal government said last year that it could cost about $25b for Medicare and $11b for Medicaid to provide the drugs over the next 10 years.",
      "\"How do we pay for that?\" Dr Fendrick asked.",
      "The Biden-era rule must go through a public comment period before the Trump administration ultimately decides whether to move forward with it, experts said.",
      "Dr Cecil said the government and private insurance companies may remain hesitant to foot the bill for such expensive medications.",
      "But she believes the savings that would come from tackling obesity for millions of Americans would greatly outweigh the short-term costs.",
      "\"Five to ten years is when we would really see a huge payoff, because that's when we would really start to see trending downwards for some of these more serious long term complications,\" Dr Cecil said.",
      "\"If everyone who needed the drugs could afford them and wanted to take them, it would be pretty game changing.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:06:25 GMT",
    "summary": "A kabaddi club has helped Indian girls find new opportunities and become financially independent as adults.",
    "story": [
      "Meena's eyes dart from left to right and back again, searching for the fleeting moment when she can make her move.",
      "She is playing Kabaddi, an Indian contact sport now played in more than 50 countries across the world.",
      "A Kabaddi game is played between two teams, each with seven players. Individuals take turns to run into the opposition's half of the pitch to tag opponents and make it back to their own half without being tackled to the ground.",
      "But for 14-year-old Meena, this is about more than winning points. The sport offers an escape from a restricted, rural life and opens up a world of opportunities.",
      "\"It feels different when I play,\" she says shyly, struggling to find the words. \"In that moment, I am not the Meena who is bound to housework, weighed down by pressures and expectations. It's just me and the opponent\u2026 It feels like I am more powerful than other girls who don't play.\"",
      "Meena lives on the outskirts of a small tribal village, Kudoshi, about 230km away from India's financial capital, Mumbai, where girls' lives traditionally revolve around household chores, marriage and children.",
      "But 15 years ago, a group of teachers at the village school decided they wanted to give girls more opportunities.",
      "\"I have a daughter. I want her to achieve things in life, live the best life she can, be something,\" says one of them, Daji Rajguru. \"Why can't girls play Kabaddi and make a career out of it?\"",
      "So he and his colleagues, who had played Kabaddi when they were younger, thought it would be good to teach local girls how to play. The pooled their savings - 5,000 rupees ($60; \u00a350) - persuaded the school to let them use its grounds, and opened what they believe was the region's first all-girls Kabaddi club.",
      "At the start, just two girls, who were pupils at the school, joined up. \"Parents were not ready to let their girls play Kabaddi as it meant spending a lot of time away from home,\" he says. \"They also worried about the impact it might have on their daughter's marriage prospects,\" as traditional families would not approve of girls going out and coming home late.",
      "Daji and his colleagues went door to door reassuring parents their daughters would be safe playing Kabaddi at training sessions before and after school. They reassured them they would supervise the girls properly and not let them be distracted by boys.",
      "At the start, the teachers would pick the girls up from their homes and drop them off, but as numbers grew they were no longer able to do that. Now, there are about 30 girls in the club and they estimate that about 300 have trained with them since they began coaching, including Daji's own daughter. Some start playing as young as seven years old.",
      "Like the rest of the members of the club, Meena trains for two hours before school and two hours after classes finish. She has to leave home at dawn and doesn't get back until nightfall.",
      "\"I go alone and it's dark [in the morning]. I used to be afraid that somebody could do something to me. My family was not supportive then, and are still unhappy with my choice to become a sportswoman,\" she says.",
      "But she is persevering, inspired by club members who have excelled over the years and joined state teams or local leagues.  Siddhi Chalke and Samreen Burandkar were among the first batch of girls who trained at the club for about eight years. Now, at the age of 25, they are professional league players and are financially independent.",
      "At the start, their families thought playing Kabaddi was a phase that would pass, and when the women decided to make a career of it, their parents were not happy. There is still pressure for them to get married but at the same time their families are also proud that the women are doing well.",
      "\"No-one in my family earns as much as I do,\" says Samreen. \"I now live in a big city and get to make my own choices. Coming from my community, it's difficult for girls to go after what they want. I am only here because of Kabaddi,\" she says.",
      "Siddhi plays on the same team as Samreen - their friendship born out of Kabaddi. They have travelled around India for competitions, winning medals and championships. \"I could only do that because of Kabaddi. Otherwise, I would have been married and ended up at my husband's place washing the dishes,\" says Siddhi and they both laugh, seemingly relieved that they have escaped this fate.",
      "Excelling in sports in India can also help players get jobs in the public sector. Indian states allocate jobs for high achievers in sports, guaranteeing an income even after a player's active sporting years are over.",
      "Many rural girls take up sport with the dream of getting financial independence via these jobs. It can also help them get greater respect and a sense of identity.",
      "\"When we started the sports club, no-one gave any importance to these girls. They were always secondary citizens in their homes, in society,\" says Vilas Bendre, a young coach at the club.",
      "\"But we realised that when rural girls climb ahead in their lives through sports, their lives change significantly. The way they talk, the way they carry themselves, their lifestyle, everything changes.\"",
      "Even if they haven't become professional sportswomen, many members of the club have seen their confidence grow and have persuaded their families to let them go to university and delay marriage until they are older.",
      "The community has become more accepting too, and when they see girls exercising, people don't frown at them any more.",
      "The club is funded by the coaches, cash prizes that the team win in competitions and occasional donations. Most of the girls are from poor and underprivileged families and don't have to pay any subscription fees.",
      "As well as training in term time, the club organises and funds residential sports camps at the school in the summer, provides food such as eggs, bananas and milk, and often pays for treatment for players' injuries.",
      "Over time, parents' fears have been assuaged, but critics sometimes question the coaches' motives. \"People say things indirectly like. 'Why don't you coach boys?'\" says Daji. But he says there are already opportunities for boys, and there is a gap when it comes to girls.",
      "\"We are not just their coaches,\" adds Vilas. \"At times we are their parents, guiding them, disciplining them, helping them make the right choice.\"",
      "And Meena knows the potential of this prized opportunity: \"I want to be the best raider and become the captain of India's Kabaddi team,\" she says, daring to dream about medals, championships and leaving an ordinary village girl's life behind.",

    "summary": "In her new musical, \"Redwood,\" the Tony Award-winning star of \"Wicked\" and \"Rent\" plays a woman seeking a refuge, and a purpose, by escaping into a redwood forest.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, when superstar Idina Menzel wasn't in New York, she hung out in Oakland, Calif. At Bandaloop Studios, she was learning to dance suspended at the end of a rope \u2026 and this from a woman who says she isn't much of a dancer on the ground. \"I don't know what I'm doing!\" she exclaimed.",
      "But when you see exactly why she was doing this, it suddenly all makes sense.",
      "In the new Broadway musical \"Redwood,\" the audience is transported to the heart of the redwood forest, and seemingly into the trees themselves. It's loosely inspired by a woman named Julia Butterfly Hill, who, in the late '90s, spent more than two years living in a thousand-year-old redwood to save it from being cut down. Her effort worked: the tree was saved.",
      "And now, Menzel and writer-director Tina Landau are taking their own leap of faith with an idea they've been kicking around for more than a decade.",
      "Asked if she was ever worried that their experiment would fail, Landau said, \"Yes, I'm still worried. I didn't know. But it was one of those passion projects for both myself and Idina where it was just like, let's just trust that what is meant to happen will happen.\"",
      "\"Redwood\" is about a workaholic mom who runs away from it all, and finds herself in the redwood forest where her life is changed forever.",
      "One of the themes of the show is based on the fact that 300-foot redwoods actually support each other. Landau said, \"Their roots only go five or six feet into the ground. Their roots go sideways instead of down, until they reach the roots of other trees, and they intertwine with those. So, all the trees end up holding each other up.\"",
      "To listen to Idina Menzel perform \"Great Escape,\" from the musical \"Redwood,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The musical, which is currently in previews, is all-new, but Menzel is on familiar ground. She's performing at the Nederlander Theatre, which is the same theatre where she opened in \"Rent\" in 1996. \"Yeah, it's like a homecoming for me. It's full circle. It's very emotional for me. When I did 'Rent,\" that was the first professional job I ever had \u2013 and it was a Broadway show. So, I was super-lucky. That was a beautiful time in my life.\"",
      "It was beautiful. She was 25 years old, and her performance in \"Rent\" put her squarely on the map, with a Tony Award nomination. \"I got a record deal that I always wanted to get,\" she said. \"I wanted to be signed to a record label so badly and make my own album, and I did. And that was a dream come true. But then I only sold, like, three albums. So, then I got dropped from the label. And then by that time, my whole kind of momentum of being this Tony-nominated actress from the hit musical 'Rent,' it sort of dissipated. And then I had to kind of keep pounding the pavement again. It wasn't until 'Wicked' that things started to really look up again.\"",
      "As the original Wicked Witch Elphaba in Broadway's \"Wicked,\" Menzel won a Tony, and helped turn the show into a mega-hit, though it wasn't always easy being green. Asked what Elphaba gave her, Menzel replied, \"Green ears for the rest of my life!\"",
      "Idina Menzel performs \"Defying Gravity\" from \"Wicked\" on \"The Late Show With David Letterman\":",
      "And then, she was an animated princess in Disney's \"Frozen,\" singing the song that millions of would-be princesses couldn't get out of their heads. \"My relationship with 'Let It Go' is fabulous,\" she said. \"It's one of the best things that's ever happened to me. People always say, 'Do you get sick of a song like that?' And maybe they think I'm lying to you, but I really don't.\"",
      "Idina Menzel, as Elsa, performs \"Let It Go\" in \"Frozen\":",
      "\"When I was a little girl, if I would have dreamt that I'd be up there singing a song like this, I wouldn't have believed it. Or, no, I would have, 'cause I really was very cocky when I was little, and I actually, you know, believed in myself and thought, 'Definitely, it's definitely gonna happen for me.'\"",
      "But the task of writing Menzel's next big song went to someone who'd never written for a big Broadway star (or for anyone). \"Redwood\" is composer Kate Diaz's very first show, but you'd never know it. Asked what it's like to write for The Idina Menzel, Diaz said, \"It's amazing. I had never written for anybody else before, so great place to start, for sure! What an incredible voice to write for.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is there a little part of you that's like, 'Let me just see if she can do this'?\"",
      "\"I mean, she usually can,\" Diaz replied, \"So, not really.\"",
      "And she can do it on demand, as she demonstrated in the new \"Wicked\" film where she brought back her classic vocal riff.",
      "Her new show offers a different way to go green: an immersion in a leafy redwood forest. Even the seats in the newly-remodeled Nederlander are green. For Menzel it's almost hard to believe: \"It's just so rare that you get to see it come to fruition after so many years, and they're literally loading things into the Nederlander as we speak. That accomplishment isn't lost on me, and it's just, I'm so emotional about it.",
      "And now she's hoping to defy gravity, again. \"But I think green and being high, flying, literally or figuratively, is just something that I must respond to or attract in my life, in my characters,\" Menzel laughed. \"And I'm kind of happy with that!\"",

    "story": [
      "It's hard to believe, but as author and Illustrator Dav Pilkey recently told students at Boy's Prep in the Bronx, he created Dog Man back when he was in second grade. \"He looks a little bit different,\" he said.",
      "The kids loved hearing when someone with learning disabilities (\"I had ADHD, and I was dyslexic, and I was the class clown, and I couldn't sit still,\" he said) could go on to be so successful.",
      "Every book in Pilkey's Dog Man series has been the bestselling children's book for the year it came out.",
      "And as the new film out next week reminds us, it all started when a police officer and his dog got into a bad accident \u2013 and doctors sewed the head of the dog onto the man's body, creating \u2026 Dog Man!",
      "And while he's part man, he's all dog. \"Oh, yeah, yeah. The man part doesn't really come out that much,\" Pilkey said.",
      "But in addition to all the fun, Pilkey tries to layer meaning into the Dog Man books, even in their titles, from \"The Scarlet Shedder\" and \"Fetch-22,\" to \"Lord of the Fleas,\" and \"A Tale of Two Kitties.\" \"I was looking at Charles Dickens' 'A Tale of Two Cities,' which is such a wonderful book. It talks about sacrifice, self-sacrifice, and the value of that.\"",
      "\"And you hope that children will be moved to read these classics?\" I asked.",
      "\"I hope so, yeah,\" Pilkey replied. \"I hope they don't think 'Oh, that Charles Dickens stole an idea from Dav Pilkey.' That wouldn't be so good!\"",
      "Pilkey's sense of humor is what made director Peter Hastings want to make the \"Dog Man\" movie. He also directed a TV series based on Pilkey's \"Captain Underpants\" books. \"I just love his sensibility, the playful anarchy of his work,\" Hastings said.",
      "Comedian Pete Davidson gets top billing in the film: \"I'm a huge Dav Pilkey fan,\" he said. \"I grew up reading all the 'Captain Underpants' books. My mom got them for me. All the young kids in my family, they all read 'Dog Man,' they're obsessed with 'Dog Man.' And then right around the time I started noticing that, we got the offer.\"",
      "It was an offer to play Dog Man's nemesis, Petey the Cat. Davidson said it was fun to play the villain: \"It's a really fun, loud, layered character,\" he said. \"I don't get a lot of opportunities to stretch like that.\"",
      "In fact, as readers of the \"Dog Man\" books know, things start to change when Petey tries to clone himself, and instead creates \u2026 an adorable kitten!",
      "\"His character has a great arc in the story,\" said Hastings.",
      "\"It's the best arc I've ever been given\" Davidson laughed. \"Usually I'm in a movie for, like, nine minutes, and then shot in the face, so it was nice to have a full [arc]!\"",
      "Asked if it's hard for someone else to control his characters, Pilkey said, \"No, no. Not at all actually. I'm just so honored that they wanted to do something with my characters, so I was like, YESSS!!! Jumping up and down.\"",
      "But Pilkey says what really matters to him is seeing how much kids appreciate all the work he puts into his books.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:07:41 -0500",
    "summary": "This month, the Sundance Film Festival is once again providing a showcase for independent filmmakers and documentarians from around the world. But that isn't all that Sundance does. \"Sunday Morning\" goes behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Park City Utah is a snow globe kind of place. It sparkles and glitters like a fairy tale, especially at this time of year, when the silver screens of Sundance come to this silver mining town, and young filmmakers start thinking of the moment they might see some glitter of their own.",
      "Sian Heder's film \"CODA\" premiered at Sundance in 2021. It went on to win three Oscars the following year, including best picture. It doesn't always happen that way, but the Sundance Film Festival does have a pretty good track record of catapulting independent filmmakers into a career.",
      "Its alumni include the likes of Steven Soderbergh (\"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\"), Quentin Tarantino (\"Reservoir Dogs\"), Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"), and Lulu Wang (\"The Farewell\"). They were all introduced not only to audiences, but to powerful film distribution companies, at the annual festival held high in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah.",
      "\"I think that was the big breakthrough with Sundance, is that finally these new voices, these exciting new filmmakers had a place where they could actually show what they had done and potentially sell them,\" said eight-time Oscar nominee Glenn Close.",
      "She first heard about Sundance from its famous founder, Robert Redford, on the set of \"The Natural.\" His idea \u2013 then in its infancy - was in some ways just as pure as baseball itself.",
      "As Redford told us in 2018, \"I said, wait a minute, there are other stories out there. There are other voices to be heard that are not being given a chance. What if we created something, an opportunity, for those people to get their films made and have them distributed? \u2026 The smaller stories. The more offbeat stories. The more controversial.\"",
      "Which is why he wanted his non-profit Sundance Institute to be held as far away from profit-focused Hollywood as possible. So, he set it up amid the pines and aspens of Utah's Provo Canyon, on land he bought after the success of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\"",
      "Close said, \"You are surrounded by nature in a way that, if you're from a city, it's undeniable,\" she said. \"It's a spiritual thing. And I think that was very important for Bob.\"",
      "Redford said he didn't think the idea he started would last beyond two or three years. But the Sundance Institute has lasted 44 years and counting. It's become for film what Michelin Stars are to fine dining.",
      "You don't choose Sundance; Sundance chooses you.",
      "Michelle Satter, the Institute's founding senior director, has been by Redford's side since 1981. \"We'll get 3,000 scripts; we'll select 12,\" she said. \"That's a tiny number. But there are a lot of people globally who want to tell stories, and we believe in the power of storytelling.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you know when you've found a unique story or a unique talent?\"",
      "\"It speaks to me,\" Satter replied. \"If they don't have a voice that is unique, we're not interested.\"",
      "\"And what does that mean to you, voice'?\"",
      "\"There's something about the way they tell the story that does not feel generic, like anybody could tell the story,\" said Satter. \"But they're bringing something from their own experience, from their own connection to storytelling that uplifts it.\"",
      "According to Satter, \"A film is not complete until it reaches an audience and engages with an audience.\"",
      "Last Spring, Satter allowed us into Sundance's storied Directors and Screenwriters Lab, this time held in Estes Park, Colorado. One of the lab's advisors was four-time Oscar nominated actor-director Ed Harris.",
      "\"It's not about ego,\" Harris said. \"It's not about anything other than learning, making mistakes. I love the work. It's all about the work, and I learn as much as I probably help anybody.\"",
      "All the Sundance \"Fellows,\" as they're called, bring projects already in the works, like Hannah Gray Organschi, polishing up her upcoming feature film. \"There's tough feedback, like, feedback that's good,\" she said. \"And to have that at the phase where you can really be deepening and honing the characters and story is, it feels lucky.\"",
      "Casey Modderno was fine tuning her rom-com: \"The questions I think that you're normally asked as a filmmaker are, like, about budget, about accessibility, about market response. And so, to be asked questions about the feeling of the film and the aesthetics of the film and the texture, and just go deep in craft, it's, like, super-special.\"",
      "And then there's Sean Wang. \"This experience has just, like, changed my DNA as a filmmaker,\" he said.",
      "What got him accepted to Sundance was his screenplay for his first feature film, \"Didi.\" He had been toiling away on the film pretty much by himself with his crew for six years. \"I was just obsessed with, 'Who won Sundance this year? Who won the Audience Award? Who won the Jury Prize? What's the next filmmaker that is coming out of Sundance?'\" he said.",
      "Turns out he was one of those Sundance filmmakers. Last year, \"Didi\" not only won two of the Sundance Film Festival's top prizes; it got him a distribution deal.",
      "Wang notes that Sundance doesn't finance films. \"They have no financial stake in your movie,\" he said. \"When we sell the movie, they're not like, 'Great. Where's our 10%?' It's a very giving environment. Obviously they want your films to succeed.\"",
      "This year the California wildfires cast a long shadow over the festival. Michelle Satter's home, where we did our interview, is now gone, as are so many others.",
      "None of those victims were forgotten in Utah this past week. As Satter told the audience, \"We lost our village, but at the end of the day, we are the village.\"",
      "As for Robert Redford, the visionary who started it all is now 88. He hasn't been here in person for the last three years, but his spirit remains. Independent film has forever been changed \u2013 a legacy that he and others have taken to the box office bank.",
      "Glenn Close said, \"He put his money where his mouth is. And you know, I'm in awe of that. And I salute him for it.\"",

      "\"Playworld\" by Adam Ross",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Prologue",
      "In the fall of 1980, when I was fourteen, a friend of my parents named Naomi Shah fell in love with me. She was thirty-six, a mother of two, and married to a wealthy man. Like so many things that happened to me that year, it didn't seem strange at the time.",
      "Two decades later, when I finally told my mother\u2014we were on Long Island, taking a walk on the beach\u2014she stopped, stunned, and said, \"But she was such an ugly woman.\" The remark wasn't as petty as it sounds. If I was aware of it then, it neither repulsed me nor affected my feelings for Naomi. It was just a thing I took for granted, like the color of her hair.",
      "Wiry and ashen, it had the shading but not the shimmer of pigeon feathers. Naomi kept it long, so that it fell past her shoulders. I knew it by touch, for my face was often buried in it. Only later did I wonder if she considered herself unattractive, because she always wore sunglasses, as if to hide her face, large gold frames with blue-tinted prescription lenses. When we were driving together, which was often that year, she'd allow these to slide down her nose and then look at me over their bridge. She might've considered this pose winning, but it was more likely to see me better. Her mouth often hung slightly open. Her lower teeth were uneven, and her tongue, which pressed against them, always tasted of coffee.",
      "Naomi's car was a silver Mercedes sedan\u2014300sd along with turbo diesel nickel-plated on the back\u2014that made a deep hum when she drove. The interior, enormous in my mind's eye, was tricked out with glossy wood paneling and white leather, back seat so wide and legroom so ample they made the driver appear to be far away. It was in this car that Naomi and I talked most often. We'd park, and then she'd lean across the armrest to press her cheek to mine, and I'd sometimes allow her to kiss me. Other times we'd move to the back. Lying there with Naomi, her nose nuzzled to my neck, I'd stare at the ceiling's dotted fabric until the pattern seemed to detach and drift like a starred sky. This car was her prized possession, and like many commuters, she had turned the machine into an extension of her body. Her left thumb lightly hooked the wheel at eight o'clock when traffic was moving, her fingertips sliding to eleven when it was slow. She preferred to sit slightly reclined, her free hand spread on her inner thigh, though after she lost her pinky the following summer, and even after being fitted with a prosthesis, she kept it tucked away.",
      "\"I was worried you'd think it was disgusting,\" she said, the digit hidden between the seat and her hip. She'd bought herself a diamond ring to hide the seam, and for the most part the likeness was uncanny, but at certain angles you could tell\u2014the cuticle's line was too smooth, the nail's pale crescent too creamy to match the others. Like my father's fake teeth, which he occasionally left lying around our apartment, I was fascinated by it, though my curiosity wasn't morbid. I was a child actor, you see, a student of all forms of dissembling, and had long ago found my greatest subject to be adults.",

      "It was meant to be a harmless prank. Not even a prank, not initially.",
      "An inside joke, only for the three of them. But now she was locking her apartment door behind two departing police officers.",
      "She had managed to sound appropriately earnest but unworried when they began asking questions. After all, why should May Hanover, of all people, be nervous around police? May was the good girl, always. The one who only needed to be told once by a teacher to open a book to a specific page. The teenager who drove strictly within the limits of her learner's permit. Even her pug, Gomez, seemed to understand at an instinctive level why he needed to break away from his neighbor buddies to ride the building's service elevator while they strutted brazenly with their humans through the lobby.",
      "May, simply put, was a rule follower. A rule enforcer, in fact. It was a trait that had helped her succeed in life, but, as she had learned, could also lead to trouble.",
      "Josh emerged from the bedroom where he'd gone to give her privacy when the police arrived. Gomez waddled slightly behind him. \"Was that about Roland Shaw?\"",
      "Shaw was the man she'd convicted in her final in-person trial as an assistant district attorney after he was found breaking into his next victim's apartment. \"How'd you know?\" Could a question be a lie? That one probably counted. So many lies since she'd gotten home yesterday from her long weekend in the Hamptons.",
      "\"That was a major case for you. I recognized the big guy from the news.\"",
      "The trial was before she and Josh had found themselves suddenly living together. Before they were engaged. The media coverage consisted of two small articles in the Post, including a photograph of a defiant-looking May flanked by two detectives in the courthouse hallway\u2014one of them the \"big guy\" Josh recognized. Whereas May was obsessed with all things crime-related\u2014in her job, the news, truth or fiction\u2014Josh found it all, quote, \"dark and depressing.\" But Josh was interested in all things May-related. Of course he had followed the coverage.",
      "\"The DA's Office got an inquiry from another jurisdiction and needed to clear something up,\" she said. Misleading, but technically true.",
      "\"They couldn't just call you?\" he asked.",
      "\"Actually, he called, but I didn't see the message.\" That one was a full-on lie. \"Guess he's training a new guy and wanted a change of scenery.\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad they were quick. I really wanted a Negroni but thought the sound of a cocktail shaker might be inadvisable while you were in official law enforcement mode.\"",
      "\"Another reason why you should stir,\" she said. \"I like what I like.\"",
      "\"Make two? I'm getting back into my comfy clothes.\" She called Lauren once she was alone in the bedroom. \"Hey there, woman. We were just saying we miss you.\"",
      "\"Yes, we miss you!\" Kelsey called out in the background. \"Come back here right now. It's boring without you.\"",
      "May could hear a few drinks' worth of enthusiasm in Kelsey's voice. \"You're clearly having a miserable time. Absolutely suffering.\" She felt a knot form in her sternum as she steeled herself to explain why she was calling. \"I don't even know how to say this, but the police are probably going to call you. Both of you.\"",
      "\"What? How would they even know about us?\" Lauren asked. \"They came to my apartment. They asked who I was with. I didn't have a choice. They have your names. And your phone numbers.\"",
      "\"How? Were there cameras or something?\"",
      "\"No, it was because of me. I'm so sorry.\"",
      "What had she gone and done? No one was supposed to know about any of their stupidity. And now something really, really bad was going to happen\u2014she could feel it. Something she couldn't control. She wanted to open her mouth wide to scream\u2014to scream impossibly loudly again, like last time.",

      "The wisest souls say that pure mountain air makes us all go a little mad. A wind\u2014lawless and long-tailed\u2014slices through the snow-stippled Apuan alps and the Apennines with all the wantonness of La Befana, the winter witch. Swifts catch this wind on their wings, carving up the crisp blue morning. Dipping down into the valley, the wind now worries over the murmuring blue tongue of the Serchio river on its journey to the Tyrrhenian Sea. It slips\u2014an unseen spirit\u2014under Devil's bridge. Shivers along the great gray hunch of the Devil's back. Hissing over every ancient stone. Rising from the river, the wind picks up speed, hastening toward the woods. Hurtling toward chestnut trees spaced like the pews of a great Duomo. The wind now weaves between golden leaves. Whispering quick consonants between the branches, borrowing an autumnal aura. Sweet sigh of ripe chestnuts and shed leaves. And here\u2014where the wind steals woodland scents\u2014hides a curiosity. Cloistered by soil, moss, stone and leaf litter, a thing unseen\u2014a thing quite mysterious\u2014lies in waiting.",
      "A thing that sits buried, like old bones.",
      "What lies under the soil has stayed secret. It is an underground barterer. A schemer who has set a trap in the soil. A sylvan swindler. A tormentor.",
      "A tiny god.",
      "Swelling to irresistible bulk, it has ripened into a knobbled fruit of corruption. And now the time has come. The tiny god releases a lusty sigh, soundlessly unfurling a phantom into the wind.",
      "No more visible than the notes of nightingale song.",
      "No more audible than a wordless wish.",
      "The tiny god has released a cipher.",
      "The breath of the tiny god is whisked away by the breeze, slipping through the damp woodland of chestnut worship. Deeper into the woods, the breath in the breeze paints the pupils of a fallow deer into great glistening lakes. Fur stiffens along a back freckled in the white of first snow. The doe salivates in answer to the call of the stranger she can smell but cannot see. Her nostrils flutter, messages flood her bloodstream. But the breath blows on.",
      "Now a wild sow lifts her moist snout from the leaf litter and inhales a slip of the wind. Instantly intoxicated, her muddy snout snuffing. The grunting sow is aroused into a frenzy. Bristled legs stab at the soil as she arranges them to assume her stance, ready to receive the boar she smells. Turning her head toward her tail, she hunts for him, but\u2014and here is the trick, here is the olfactory deception\u2014there is no boar and the breeze blows on through the woods, fanning the sensual scent along with it.",
      "See-through scarves of scent curl from the forest and swirl toward a beautiful medieval village, perched upon a peak. Its tallest point an 11th century bell tower with memories of steel swords and shields. The wind, pickled with flavors of the forest, ridden by the breath of the tiny god, tickles trees of olive and cyprus. Until it dangles its string of little calamities above cobblestone streets and terracotta roof tiles.",
      "And it settles upon the medieval village like a spell.",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's controversial pick to head the federal Department of Health and Human Services, will appear Wednesday before a Senate panel that is crucial to advance his nomination.",
      "Kennedy is due to appear first at the Senate Committee on Finance, the panel that will ultimately be the committee with the deciding vote on whether his nomination to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services advances to the full Senate. He must receive a majority of senators to be confirmed to head HHS, which encompasses America's federal health agencies.",
      "The committee's jurisdiction largely focuses on the department's mammoth Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs for seniors and low-income Americans, which make up the largest share of mandatory spending in the federal budget.",
      "He will head next to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP, which is scheduled to question Kennedy on Thursday.",
      "That committee's focus includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health, all agencies that would fall under Kennedy's authority if he is confirmed to lead the department.",
      "Trump's picks to head all of those agencies will also need to face their own Senate confirmation hearings. While some have voiced different opinions from him in the past, Kennedy could have broad authority to override them as secretary.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda?",
      "This week's hearings will offer the first public window into Kennedy's broad \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda in many weeks, after Kennedy and other nominees retreated from public appearances and social media posts.",
      "Advisers have been huddling with Kennedy for months behind closed doors, multiple advisers say, hashing out how and whether to implement dramatic changes he has sought to the federal government's health bureaucracy.",
      "Kennedy's supporters say many of his stances, like questioning ultra-processed foods and the risks of synthetic food additives and dyes, have hit on broad appeal among both Republicans and some Democrats that could buoy his chances to clear the Senate.",
      "Through the FDA, Kennedy would be able to exercise substantial authority on how foods are regulated, labeled and recommended by the federal government.",
      "But Kennedy is also facing criticism from both sides of the aisle, setting up a confirmation battle that multiple allies say he has privately acknowledged will be an uphill fight.",
      "His aides are facing mounting criticism over a department-wide communications \"pause\" that has stymied releases across the health agencies, which is timed to end in the days after Kennedy's confirmation hearings wrap up.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s stance on abortion rights?",
      "Conservative groups have also been divided over Kennedy's nomination, with some criticizing his past statements voicing support for abortion rights.",
      "The issue is expected to be a large focus of Kennedy's hearings: as secretary, he would have authority over how the FDA regulates medications used for abortions.",
      "Kennedy has reassured conservative groups and lawmakers that he would hew closely to Mr. Trump's campaign trail promise to defer the issue to the states.",
      "But Kennedy and the Trump administration will have little room to avoid the issue, given an ongoing federal court case against the FDA. Conservatives have called on the Trump administration's FDA to roll back moves made since 2016 to ease access to abortion pills.",
      "The FDA's decision to ease those so-called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or REMS restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone were the focus of a Supreme Court case last year that ended in defeat for abortion opponents.",
      "\"Walking back REMS has significantly increased safety risks for women. And so from our perspective, as directed by the administration, we do believe that an RFK HHS has the ability to direct the FDA to review safety,\" said John Mize, CEO of Americans United for Life.",
      "Mize's group has petitioned the FDA \"urging the reinstatement of basic safety measures\" while additional data is collected on their risks. He cited the death of Amber Thurman in a high-profile case that made headlines last year after a medication abortion.",
      "\"I've seen this from RFK in the past, that he is absolutely laser focused on the safety of pharmaceuticals. And so this gives us a really good opportunity to expose a safety issue,\" said Mize.",
      "FDA officials have defended their decision to ease the restrictions, saying that multiple reviews by the agency's staff support the safety of easing the limits on when during a pregnancy the pills can be taken and allowing mail-order and retail pharmacies to dispense the medication.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s stance on vaccines?",
      "Many Democrats, nonprofits and health experts have also blasted Kennedy over his record of misleading and unfounded health claims, in addition to work by him and his allies opposing the approvals and authorizations of a range of vaccines, including COVID-19 and polio shots.",
      "Kennedy has sought to assuage concerns that he would upend vaccines using his authority, pledging in the days after the election not to ban any shots.",
      "In his government ethics agreement, Kennedy also promises for a year to not intervene in any matters involving a nonprofit he chaired, Children's Health Defense, which has battled federal agencies over vaccine authorizations and requirements.",
      "\"They're not interested in validating the press narrative that Bobby's going to come in and make sweeping changes in vaccine policy. That's going to be kind of political suicide right now,\" said Dr. Robert Malone, a close Kennedy ally who has fiercely opposed the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, told CBS News.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a medical doctor and head of the Senate's health committee, said he had \"a frank conversation\" on \"vaccines at length\" with Kennedy after voicing concern over his past statements.",
      "The FDA's top vaccines official has also voiced optimism that he might find common ground with Kennedy over vaccines.",
      "\"This is how the sausage gets made. And you know, it's not always pretty and it isn't always what you want, but I'm really encouraged to see Bobby be pragmatic about the political realities here,\" said Malone.",
      "Who is RFK Jr?",
      "When Kennedy first announced his campaign as a Democratic presidential candidate in April 2023, he touted his decades-long record as an environmental lawyer.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 whose father, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign \u2014 says he did not want to immediately enter politics, and instead \"carried on his family's legacy by devoting himself to environmental causes and children's welfare.\"",
      "That followed a struggle with substance abuse when he was younger, which he says spanned 14 years after he started using heroin at 15 years old.",
      "Kennedy made headlines for his environmental work was as founder and president of the nonprofit Waterkeeper Alliance from the 1980s until 2020, ranging from local efforts to clean up the Hudson River to campaigning against an oil pipeline in North Dakota.",
      "What Kennedy has described as his \"reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate\" dates back to 2005, when he wrote an article in Rolling Stone exploring supposed evidence for a link between autism and an ingredient that had formerly been used in some vaccines. The article contained numerous scientific and factual errors and was eventually retracted. Decades of research has established there is no such link.",
      "In 2016, Kennedy joined a nonprofit focused on mercury, which later broadened its focus and rebranded to Children's Health Defense. Kennedy chaired the group and served as one of its loudest voices raising doubts about vaccines and fighting against vaccine requirements and approvals.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, they clashed with federal health agencies over use of ivermectin and the federal mask mandate in travel. In 2021, the FDA denied their petition asking to revoke all COVID-19 vaccine authorizations and ban studies of the shots for children.",
      "As a candidate, Kennedy continued to say that he thought vaccines as well as \"a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods\" were to blame for rising rates of autism and other chronic diseases in U.S. children. Experts have attributed the global rise in autism prevalence in part to broader awareness and changes to how the disorder is classified and diagnosed.",
      "Kennedy's longshot bid to challenge President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary ended in October 2023, when he switched his campaign to an independent presidential bid. He dropped out of the campaign and endorsed Mr. Trump in August 2024.",

    "story": [
      "An Alabama woman passed a major milestone Saturday to become the longest-living recipient of a pig organ transplant \u2013 healthy and full of energy with her new kidney for 61 days and counting.",
      "\"I'm superwoman,\" Towana Looney told The Associated Press, laughing about outpacing family members on long walks around New York City as she continues her recovery. \"It's a new take on life.\"",
      "Looney's vibrant recovery is a morale boost in the quest to make\u00a0animal-to-human transplants a reality. Looney the\u00a0fifth American\u00a0given a\u00a0gene-edited pig organ.",
      "\"If you saw her on the street, you would have no idea that she's the only person in the world walking around with a pig organ inside them that's functioning,\" said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led Looney's transplant.",
      "Montgomery called Looney's kidney function \"absolutely normal.\" Doctors hope she can leave New York \u2013 where she's temporarily living for post-transplant checkups \u2013 for her Gadsden, Alabama, home in about another month.",
      "\"We're quite optimistic that this is going to continue to work and work well for, you know, a significant period of time,\" he said.",
      "Why scientists are using pig organs for transplants",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address a severe shortage of transplantable human organs. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Pig organ transplants so far have been \"compassionate use\" cases, experiments the Food and Drug Administration allows only in special circumstances for people out of other options.",
      "And the handful of hospitals trying them are sharing information of what worked and what didn't, in preparation for the world's first formal studies of xenotransplantation, expected to begin sometime this year. United Therapeutics, which supplied Looney's kidney, recently asked the Food and Drug Administration for permission to begin a trial.",
      "How Looney fares is a \"very precious experience,\" said Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the world's first pig kidney transplant last year and works with another pig developer, eGenesis.",
      "Looney was far healthier than the prior patients, Kawai noted, so her progress will help inform the next attempts.",
      "\"We have to learn from each other,\" he said.",
      "Towana Looney's transplant story",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed, something incredibly rare among living donors. She spent eight years on dialysis before doctors concluded she'd likely never get a donated organ \u2013 she'd developed super-high levels of antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney.",
      "So Looney, 53, sought out the pig experiment. No one knew how it would work in someone \"highly sensitized\" with those overactive antibodies.",
      "Discharged just 11 days after the Nov. 25 surgery, Montgomery's team has closely tracked her recovery through blood tests and other measurements. About three weeks after the transplant, they caught subtle signs that rejection was beginning \u2013 signs they'd learned to look for thanks to a 2023 experiment when a pig kidney worked for 61 days inside a deceased man whose body was donated for research.",
      "Montgomery said they successfully treated Looney and there's been no sign of rejection since \u2013 and a few weeks ago she met the family behind that deceased-body research.",
      "\"It feels really good to know that the decision I made for NYU to use my brother was the right decision and it's helping people,\" said Mary Miller-Duffy, of Newburgh, New York.",
      "Looney in turn is trying to help others, serving as what Montgomery calls an ambassador for people who've been reaching out to her through social media, sharing their distress at the long wait for transplants and wondering about pig kidneys.",
      "One, she said, was being considered for a xenotransplant at another hospital but was scared, wondering whether to proceed.",
      "\"I didn't want to persuade him whether to do or not to do it,\" Looney said.",
      "Instead, she asked if he was religious and urged him to pray, to \"go off your faith, what your heart tells you.\"",
      "\"I love talking to people, I love helping people,\" she added. \"I want to be, like, some educational piece\" for scientists to help others.",
      "There's no way to predict how long Looney's new kidney will work but if it were to fail she could receive dialysis again.",
      "\"The truth is we don't really know what the next hurdles are because this is the first time we've gotten this far,\" Montgomery said. \"We'll have to continue to really keep a close eye on her.\"",

      "Publication of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's authoritative scientific publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, has also been delayed, health officials said. Articles have been published virtually every Thursday for decades, detailing agency guidance, updates on disease outbreak investigations and studies of health threats. But no issue was published this past Thursday.",

      "At the National Institutes of Health, meetings set up to review grant applications were abruptly canceled and agency experts at outside events and conferences were either unexpectedly recalled or participated without making any comments, one researcher said.",
      "A meeting organized by the Presidential Advisory Council for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria scheduled for next week was also canceled, according to an email obtained by CBS News. Health officials from several countries were scheduled to discuss strategies to respond to superbugs at the meeting.",
      "Another monthly meeting scheduled by the CDC for Jan. 27 with testing laboratories was also canceled. The CDC relies on the monthly calls to answer questions about guidance and ongoing outbreaks from labs, like about the recent change in testing procedures in response to this past year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak.",

      "Fitbit received numerous reports of the lithium-ion batteries in the watches overheating during 2018, 2019 and continuing into 2020, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). In early 2020, Fitbit made an update to address the defect, but continued to hear from people suffering burns and did not report the issue to regulators as legally required.",

    "summary": "President Trump has painted a bullseye on diversity, equity and inclusion. But what exactly is DEI, and what has it achieved?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government is renewing debate over what DEI is and whether it has benefited workers and companies.",
      "DEI has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion and other criteria. In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity.",
      "This push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0order, issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as \"illegal and immoral,\" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave.",
      "What is DEI in the workplace?",
      "DEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation.",
      "Many critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism.",
      "But DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees.",
      "\"DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'\" David Glasglow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool.\"",
      "In defining DEI, Glasglow described \"diversity\" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. \"It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status.",
      "\"These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,\" she explained.",
      "The equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work.",
      "\"It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,\" Fulton said. \"It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive.\"",
      "Corporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton.",
      "\"It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,\" Fulton said.",
      "Given the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford,\u00a0Harley Davidson,\u00a0McDonald's, Meta and more.",
      "How is success measured?",
      "Many corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues.",
      "Glasglow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. \"It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,\" he said. \"It also depends on what you are trying to achieve.\"",
      "One tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired \u2014 patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness.",
      "By contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool.",
      "Corporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line.",
      "\"The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,\" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry.\"",
      "In one noted study, McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research, the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management \u2014 women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015.",
      "\"[A] lot of the language and framing right now of DEI as illegal and discriminatory obscures who it's really for, which is all of us, and to the benefit of companies,\" Fulton told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "Chinese startup DeepSeek has debuted an AI app that challenges OpenAI's ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, sending a shock through Wall Street.",
    "story": [
      "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after Mr. Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

    "summary": "Workers at a Whole Foods Market in Philly have voted to unionize, becoming the first group of employees to pull off a labor win at the chain.",
    "story": [
      "Workers at a Whole Foods Market in Pennsylvania voted to unionize on Monday, becoming the first group of employees to pull off a labor win at the Amazon-owned grocery store chain.",
      "Employees at the Philadelphia store at 21st Street and Pennsylvania Avenue cast 130 votes \u2014 or about 57% of the ballots cast \u2014 in favor of joining a local chapter of The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union for the purposes of collective bargaining. According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",
      "\"This fight is far from over, but today's victory is an important step forward,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of UFCW Local 1776. \"We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers' needs and priorities.\"",
      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon's grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",
      "In a statement after the votes were counted Monday night, Whole Foods said it \"is proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.\"",
      "\"We are disappointed by the outcome of this election, but we are committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store,\" the company added.",
      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \"on-demand\" mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid. Whole Foods disputed the worker was fired in retaliation.",
      "The union has also accused Whole Foods of withholding region-wide wage increases from employees at the Philadelphia store because of the union activities.",
      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",
      "The company said it was delaying the pay bumps until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the vote with raises.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon has resisted union organizing efforts by its workers. Amazon delivery drivers went on strike in a handful of U.S. cities before Christmas to exert pressure on the the company to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are scheduled to vote next month on whether they want to be represented by an upstart union called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment.",
      "The retail giant has challenged the structure of the National Labor Relations Board in court. Amazon accused the federal agency of tampering in the 2022 union election at the Staten Island warehouse, in part by bringing a lawsuit against the company to reinstate a fired organizer close to when voting began.",

      "The self-serve condiment bars, home to creamers, milk, sweeteners and stirrers, were removed from Starbucks locations during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Starbucks previously said the return to letting customers do it themselves will help free up baristas to make other drinks.",

      "\"Offering customers who sit and stay their beverages in ceramic mugs and glassware is one way we're returning our cafes to warm welcoming coffeehouses,\" a Starbucks spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \"It's also another way that Starbucks is reducing waste and making each visit a more sustainable choice.\"",
      "More than 75% of Starbucks' U.S. beverage sales are cold drinks, often served in plastic cups. Though the caf\u00e9s offer recycling bins, a recent CBS News investigation found that many of those cups don't actually end up getting recycled. It's a problem that goes far beyond Starbucks \u2014 few recycling facilities around the country accept this type of single-use plastic for processing.",
      "Starbucks says it aims to reduce its overall waste by 50% by 2030, and it rolled out redesigned cups last year made with up to 20% less plastic.",
      "Customers who order their drinks \"for here,\" in a reusable cup or mug, will also be eligible for free refills during that visit if they get hot or iced brewed coffee or tea at participating locations in the U.S. and Canada. But fans of cold brew, nitro cold brew, iced tea lemonade, flavored ice tea and Starbucks Refreshers are out of luck \u2014 those drinks are not included in the refill deal.",
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol last year shared his vision of Starbucks becoming \"a welcoming coffee house where people gather and where we serve the finest coffee.\"",
      "Under his leadership, Starbucks also recently reversed its open-door policy, requiring people to make a purchase if they want to hang out at its coffee shops or use the restrooms.

      "\"SSA's ability to implement the law in a timely manner and without negatively affecting day-to-day customer service relies on funding,\" according to the agency. \"Though SSA is helping some affected beneficiaries now, under SSA's current budget, SSA expects that it could take more than one year to adjust benefits and pay all retroactive benefits.\"",

      "The first proposal, which ByteDance hasn't responded to, sought to create a new structure that would merge San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
      "The new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity's proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.",

      "ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Under the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a \"full U.S. board control,\" the person said.",
      "Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok's U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.",
      "The proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during President Donald Trump's first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures \u2014 that a new investor in TikTok could simply \"dilute down\" the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.",

      "\"Numerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary. ... I'd only do it if the United States benefits.\"",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Mr. Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.",
      "Mr. Trump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \"right down the road\" from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \"I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I've spoken to many people about TikTok and there's great interest in TikTok.\"",
      "TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Mr. Trump said he would postpone the ban. Mr. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year's presidential election.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Mr. Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, along with some other tech leaders who've been forging friendlier ties with the new administration.",
      "Congress voted to ban TikTok in the U.S. out of concern that TikTok's ownership structure represented a security risk. The Biden administration argued in court for months that it was too much of a risk to allow a Chinese company to control the algorithm that fuels what people see on the app. Officials also raised concerns about user data collected on the platform.",
      "However, to date, the U.S. hasn't provided public evidence of TikTok handing user data to Chinese authorities or allowing them to tinker with its algorithm.",

      "As a result of a poorly seated input shaft ring, the vehicles' \"power transfer unit (PTU) may become damaged and disengage the transmission and differential, resulting in a loss of drive power and/or loss of park function,\" the recall documents state. \"A loss of drive power can increase the risk of a crash.

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 16:20:29 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump revoked a 1965 rule that prohibited federal contractors from discriminating against employees or job applicants.",
    "story": [
      "Among the flurry of executive orders since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Donald Trump has taken aim at\u00a0rooting out diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs within the federal government. But his efforts go beyond DEI, with one recent order rescinding a Civil Rights-era rule that has helped protect millions of workers from discrimination.",
      "Mr. Trump's Jan. 21\u00a0order \u2014 \"Ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity\" \u2014 revokes the\u00a0Equal Employment Opportunity\u00a0rule signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u2014 which is still law today \u2014 had a loophole that excluded federal employees.",
      "Johnson signed the Equal Employment Opportunity rule to close the loophole, and those protections were signed into law in 1972. That rule bars federal contractors, who today employ 3.7 million people, from discriminating against job applicants or workers on the basis of race, gender, religion and other protected characteristics. It also gave the Labor Department the authority to take action against discrimination.",
      "Mr. Trump's order does not invalidate the law, and private and federal employees are still protected from discrimination as laid out under the Civil Rights Act. But his order does strike down the 1965 rule prohibiting contractors that do business with the government from taking race, gender and the other protected criteria into account.",
      "More broadly, revoking the 60-year-old Equal Employment Opportunity order eliminates a bedrock of civil rights protection for American workers, signaling an effort to target workplace issues that go beyond DEI, labor experts say. While DEI is shorthand for programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups, the Equal Employment Opportunity rule prohibited federal contractors from engaging in acts of discrimination, such as refusing to hire someone due to their race or paying an employee less because of their gender.",
      "\"It is still stunning to me that he took such an extraordinary step,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, CEO of the National Women's Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on gender justice. Revoking the rule signals \"he is going after something bigger: the basic and foundational idea that we should be able to work at workplaces without discrimination.\"",
      "She added, \"We agreed to that 60 years ago, and I'll add that people in this country support it, too.\"",
      "What was the Equal Employment Opportunity rule?",
      "The rule required federal contractors to \"take affirmative action\" to ensure that workers aren't discriminated against based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin. This covered everything from hiring to promotions and pay, with the Department of Labor tasked with overseeing and enforcing the rule.",
      "How does revoking the rule impact protections for workers?",
      "It's still illegal under U.S. law for employers to discriminate on the basis of race, gender or other traits, labor experts said.",
      "But rescinding the Equal Employment Opportunity rule could have a chilling effect on cases where workers at federal contractors allege they have been treated unfairly and could impact the Department of Labor's ability to pursue workplace discrimination cases, Josh Boxerman, government affairs manager at the National Employment Law Project, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Taking away this set of tools puts workers at a disadvantage,\" he added.",
      "Does this have an impact on private employers?",
      "While the Equal Employment Opportunity rule focuses on federal contractors, Mr. Trump's executive orders could spill over to private employers, said Alex Hontos, a partner at law firm Dorsey & Whitney and expert on government contracting.",
      "\"It's not just about government contractors and grantees,\" Hontos said. \"It is clearly a stepwise approach and is going to apply to the private sector. You see that at the back end of the [executive order], where attorneys general have been directed to put a plan together to either call out private-sector companies that are involved in DEI or to actually seek enforcement actions in some way.\"",
      "Even before Mr. Trump's orders banning DEI from federal agencies, corporations, including Meta,\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart, have been stepping back from these programs. Those decisions followed a 2023 Supreme Court decision\u00a0banning affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.",
      "Why is President Trump banning DEI and revoking the Equal Employment Opportunity rule?",
      "Mr. Trump's aim is to restore what the administration considers to be a merit-based hiring system, according to officials and his executive orders.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence and hard work,' the president wrote in the order to revoke the 1965 rule.",
      "DEI policies, he wrote, have led to \"illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing.\"",
      "Numerous lawsuits have taken aim at DEI programs, with some alleging that the policies discriminate against people who aren't minorities or that they violate some workers' rights to free speech, among other allegations,\u00a0according to New York University's Meltzer Center.",
      "\"The Trump administration isn't getting rid of the concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion as they are typically understood,\" a viewpoint from Erec Smith, research fellow at the Cato Institute and co-founder of Free Black Thought, a nonprofit dedicated to highlighting viewpoint diversity within Black communities. \"He's getting rid of the critical social justice version, which is inherently divisive.\"",
      "The order sends a clear message that the Trump administration does not support such initiatives.",
      "What will happen with DEI programs?",
      "DEI programs are being scrubbed from the federal government, according to the Trump administration's directives.",
      "All federal employees in DEI roles were placed on leave by 5 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday. Agencies were also told to \"take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) of DEIA [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility] offices\"; cancel upcoming DEI trainings; and terminate contracts with DEI-related contractors by the same time Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's Jan. 21 executive order requires federal agencies to come up with \"up to nine potential civil compliance investigations\" of publicly traded companies, large nonprofits and other private institutions with DEI programs that \"constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.\"",
      "That part of the executive order \"seems to be an attempt to intimidate the private sector,\" NELP's Boxerman said of the requirement to pursue civil investigations in the private sector. \"This seems to be a clear effort to name and shame companies that are doing the right thing,\" he said.",

      "The Minneapolis-based retailer said the changes to its \"Belonging at the Bullseye\" strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.",
      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year. The company said Friday that it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.",
      "The goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.",
      "Target has long been a fierce corporate advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people.

      "\"Many years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,\" Fernandez wrote in the memo, which Target shared Friday. \"And as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future.\"",
      "There's no doubt the U.S. civil rights landscape has undergone a massive transformation in the five years since much of corporate America adopted DEI goals in response to the Black Lives Matter protests that followed Floyd's death in Minneapolis.",

      "President Donald Trump this week signaled his administration's agreement with conservatives who argue that policies designed to increase minority representation by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unconstitutional.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending DEI programs within the federal government.

Target said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they're connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.",
      "Getting corporations to withdraw from the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and to stop sponsoring Pride activities have been goals of DEI opponents.",
      "Steering clear of a backlash from conservative customers and organizations is something that Target has tried to navigate for a while.

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:20:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Republican lawmakers are floating a range of ideas to pay for an extension of President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
    "story": [
      "A key economic priority for President Trump this year is to extend the provisions in his signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a 2017 law that lowered tax rates for most Americans, before they expire at the end of 2025. Now, Republican lawmakers have developed a 50-page laundry list of ideas for how to pay for those planned cuts.",
      "The plan from congressional Republicans,\u00a0published earlier by the New York Times, was confirmed by a person familiar with the document, who noted that it represents a menu of policy options for lawmakers to consider. The document also cites several new tax breaks proposed by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail last falls, such as eliminating taxes on overtime and tips.",
      "But extending the TCJA's provisions alone could prove costly, with the Congressional Budget Office forecasting a cost of $4.6 trillion over 10 years. Adding new tax breaks, such as Mr. Trump's promise to ditch taxes on overtime pay, could push up the bill even higher at a time when the nation's debt has spiraled to more than $36 trillion.",
      "According to the document, some ideas for funding those tax breaks include eliminating the mortgage home deduction, a popular break for homeowners, and the deductibility of student loan interest. Other methods to drum up more money include an across-the-board 10% import tariff \u2014 essentially, a universal tax on U.S. imports that would be paid by consumers.",
      "The plan also outlines ideas for cutting federal spending, primarily by trimming outlays for social safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. Overall, the document points to a potential tax overhaul that could put more money in the pockets of wealthier \u00a0Americans while cutting assistance for low- and middle-class taxpayers, experts say.",
      "\"If you are extending the tax cuts and enacting tariffs and cutting Medicaid, that will deliver benefits more among higher-income households, and more of a cost will be born by lower-income households,\" Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Adding a blanket 10% tariff could raise $1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the document shared with Republican lawmakers. But tariffs are largely paid by consumers because companies tend to raise their prices to cover the extra import duties. Mr. Trump's tariffs could add $2,600 a year in costs for the typical U.S. family, according to an August\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",

      "While campaigning last year, Mr. Trump proposed scrapping the $10,000 cap on the SALT deduction, which he introduced in his 2017 tax bill. The issue has become increasingly unpopular among Republicans and Democrats alike, as rising home values and property taxes across the nation means more homeowners are feeling the pinch from the deduction limit.",
      "\"The SALT cap was effectively one of the biggest pay-fors in the 2017 legislation, and raising it is expensive,\" the Tax Policy Center's Rosenberg said. \"The president recently signaled again that the most likely direction is for the SALT cap to be raised rather than to be eliminated.\"",

      "Economic losses from hurricanes and other natural disasters soared in the U.S. last year and were above average globally, reflecting another year of costly severe storms, floods and droughts.",
      "Damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton helped push total economic losses from natural disasters in the U.S. to $217.8 billion last year, according to insurance broker Aon PLC. That figure represents an 85.3% increase from 2023, when losses totaled about $117.5 billion. It's also the largest annual tally of economic losses from natural disasters since 2017.",
      "Insured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022. In some areas, homes are such great a risk that they're\u00a0too expensive to insure \u2014 if private insurance is even available at all.",
      "Hurricane Helene tore across six southeastern states last fall, costing $75 billion in economic losses, mainly due to inland and coastal flooding. according to Aon. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the west coast of Florida, causing some $25 billion in economic losses.",
      "\"In 2024, one of the big differences is we had significant U.S. hurricane events that happened,\" said Liz Henderson, global head of climate risk advisory at Aon. \"When those events happen, they affect a large area and they affect areas with large values in terms of properties and people and content. So the losses from those events tend to be significantly higher.\"",
      "At least two other hurricanes, several severe \"convective\" storms and a draught contributed to the losses from natural disasters in the U.S. last year.",
      "In addition to the severe storms in the U.S., deadly floods in the Valencia region of Spain and other natural disasters drove worldwide economic losses from natural disasters to $368 billion last year, according to Aon. That's a 7.3% decline from 2023, but about 14% higher than the annual average going back to 2000. Global insured losses, meanwhile, climbed 15.1% to $145 billion.",
      "While it's impossible to predict the timing, location and losses from natural disasters, 2025 is not off to an encouraging start. The devastating wildfires that erupted in Los Angeles County on Jan. 7, killing at least 28 people and destroying more than 14,000 structures, are already projected to be among the costliest natural disasters.",
      "In a separate report last week, Aon estimated that total economic and insured losses for the two largest wildfires \u2014 the Palisades fire and the Eaton blaze burning just outside Los Angeles \u2014 could reach into the lower tens of billions of dollars, likely making them the costliest wildfires in U.S. history.",
      "Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles neighborhood that's been\u00a0devastated by the Palisades fire, is emblematic of the insurance nightmare increasingly facing homeowners residing in regions prone to climate disasters.",

    "summary": "Costco's public support of DEI programs contrasts with positions taken in recent months by other big U.S. brands",
    "story": [
      "Costco shareholders voted down a shareholder proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices.",
      "According to preliminary results shared by Costco executives at its annual meeting Thursday, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal.",
      "In a pre-recorded statement which was played at Costco's 2025 annual shareholders meeting on Jan. 23, the shareholder proposing the anti-DEI resolution, The National Center for Public Policy Research, said that \"Diversity, equity and inclusion may sound benign on the surface, but in reality it is weaponized language concealing a radical Marxist agenda.\"",
      "The shareholder continued to say that DEI \"comes at the expense of merit by not hiring and promoting completely, irrespective of race and sex.\"",
      "Prior to the shareholder meeting, Costco's board of directors had voted unanimously to ask investors to reject the motion. The board had said it believes \"our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.\"",
      "Costco's defense of its DEI practices comes as other large U.S. corporations are shifting away from programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups. In recent weeks, companies including\u00a0Meta,\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0have ended their DEI programs, decisions that follow the 2023 Supreme Court decision\u00a0banning affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.",
      "\"Our commitment to inclusion ... does not and has never included quotas or systematic preferences, nor does it mean compromising merit,\" said Tony E. James, Costco's board chair, said at Thursday's meeting. \"The demands of our business and our steadfast commitment to serve our members mean that we cannot afford to do anything but hire and promote the most qualified individuals,\"",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank based in Washington, had earlier submitted a\u00a0proposal\u00a0asking Costco to examine the risks of its DEI program, arguing that such initiatives hold \"litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\"",
      "The think tank, which has made a similar proposal to Apple, cited the U.S. Supreme Court decision in July 2023 that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.",
      "Costco: Diversity fosters \"creativity and innovation\"",
      "The directors' message to shareholders details how having diverse employees and suppliers has, in their view, fostered \"creativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer\" and led to greater customer satisfaction among Costco members.",
      "In advance of the meeting, Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting firm GlobalData's retail division, said Costco could be confident the proposal would be rejected.",
      "\"I think people generally have confidence in Costco's management, and there's an attitude of 'Why rock the boat? It's sailing very nicely,'\" Saunders said.",
      "Costco's public stance in support of diversity, equity and inclusion programs contrasts with the positions taken in recent months by other big consumer brands that have backed away from DEI. Last week, more than 30 Walmart shareholders, including Amalgamated Bank and Oxfam America, asked the CEO of the nation's largest retailer to explain the business impact of curbing the company's DEI policies, a move they called \"disheartening.\"",
      "Emboldened by the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "On Monday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at terminating DEI programs within federal agencies. Conservatives have long condemned them, arguing they violate the U.S. Constitution by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation.",
      "The Trump administration's plan includes leveraging the Justice Department and other agencies to probe private companies pursuing training and hiring practices that conservative critics consider discriminatory against people who do not belong to minority groups, such as white men.",
      "Costco's financial performance",
      "As for Costco, the National Center for Public Policy Research alleged that at least 200,000 of the company's 300,000 employees worldwide \"are potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight.\" If only a fraction of those employees were to sue Costco, the legal costs could be significant, the center said.",
      "Costco has a chief diversity officer, but the company's executive ranks do not reflect the diversity of its customers. Nearly 81% of the executives Costco had in place last year were white, and 72% of them were men, according to data published on its website. Saunders said members of Costco's management team typically stay a long time given the company's solid and stable financial performance.",
      "The warehouse giant's sales rose 7.5% in its most recent quarter versus the year-earlier period, while net income jumped 13% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, Costco's stock has soared about 36% during the past 12 months, outpacing the S&P 500's 26% gain over the same period.",
      "In other ways, Costco has been a bit of a maverick in the corporate world. It doesn't have an official corporate public relations team, and it hasn't focused on building up online business as much as rivals Walmart and Target.",
      "Apple's support of DEI",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research intends to present a proposal at Apple's Feb. 25 shareholder meeting that goes beyond what the think tank wants from Costco. The center's resolution asks the tech company to abolish its inclusion and equity department, policies and goals, describing them as \"consistent with, if not more radical than, most corporate DEI programs.",
      "Apple's board wants shareholders to vote down the proposal, saying the company strives \"to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\"",
      "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this week joined the corporate leaders taking a stand in support of the expanded diversity goals some companies added after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. Dimon defended his bank's DEI policies during an interview with CNBC.",
      "\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,\" he said, speaking Wednesday from the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. \"And wherever I go, red states, blue states, green states, mayors, governors and they said they like what we do.\"",
      "Trump's actions this week increase the potential legal risks for companies that resist the conservative backlash against DEI, according to David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law. But most big companies will have consulted their lawyers or performed an internal self-audit after the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling, Glasgow said.",
      "\"So if you are an Apple or another company who's done that, and you're confident in the legality of your existing DEI program, ... I think what you should do right now is stand firm,\" he said.",

      "Whippany, New Jersey \u2014 Tom Maoli, the owner of a new and used car dealership in New Jersey, says drivers could see a big jump in prices if President Trump follows through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada.",
      "\"Every car that comes out of any dealership is going to raise the prices,\" Maoli said. \"Parts come from all over the world.\"",
      "The average price of a new passenger vehicle in the U.S. in December was $49,740, according to Kelly Blue Blook.",
      "Maoli speculates that if tariffs are implemented, prices for new cars could jump anywhere from 5% to \"up to 15%.\"",
      "With higher prices for new cars, prices for used vehicles would also rise because of increased demand.",
      "Some of the biggest car brands, including Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, have plants in Mexico and Canada.",
      "And according to Maoli, more than half of the parts \u2014 such as batteries and motor components \u2014 for cars assembled at production plants in the U.S. are sourced elsewhere and could also get hit with tariffs, especially with the president also proposing new tariffs on China.",
      "\"I think the manufacturer has no choice but to pass that along to the consumer, because they need to drive profits,\" Maoli said.",
      "How quickly could consumers see prices increase?",
      "\"Anything that has not been shipped yet \u2014 or is at the dock that's getting shipped into these ports \u2014 that's ultimately going into a vehicle to be manufactured,\" Maoli said. \"It's immediate.\"",

    "summary": "Nearly 60% of Americans don't have enough money put away to handle common financial emergencies, according to Bankrate.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's a busted refrigerator, car trouble or medical issues, unexpected costs are a part of life. But even such routine curveballs often spell serious financial trouble for many Americans.",
      "That's according to a new Bankrate report that surveyed more than 1,000 U.S. adults about their ability to handle a surprise bill. Despite the country's current\u00a0low unemployment rate, the annual study found that 59% of Americans in 2025 don't have enough savings to cover an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense.",
      "\"We are essentially a paycheck-to-paycheck nation,\" Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick said in a statement. \"Fewer Americans have the equivalent of a financial safety net to cover inevitable unexpected expenses, despite low unemployment and steady growth. This is one of the consequences of elevated prices stemming from inflation, the impacts of which are still being felt.\"",
      "A key issue in the 2024 presidential election, inflation and the rising\u00a0cost of everyday items\u00a0continues to impact Americans. Grocery inflation during the height of the coronavirus epidemic reached a\u00a0peak of 13.5% in 2022, while the overall rate of inflation for all products and services topped out at 9.1%.",
      "Although inflation has cooled to an annual rate of 2.9% as of December, prices for food, shelter and many other items remain elevated. Consumers also have found that many common products, from snacks to paper towels, have gotten smaller, a retailing tactic\u00a0known as \"shrinkflation\u00a0aimed at cutting a manufacturer's costs.",
      "In his Jan. 20 inaugural speech, President Trump said he would direct his cabinet \"to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.\"",
      "Whether the Trump administration can engineer such a feat remains to be seen, while polls suggest that many Americans are skeptical that prices will return to earth. Economists also warn that Mr. Trump's policies, which could include steep new tariffs on U.S. imports and the deportation millions of undocumented immigrants, could prove inflationary.",
      "Younger Americans worry most",
      "To be sure, the meteoric rise in the cost of food, housing and health care over the past several years has made it hard for many households to make ends meet, let alone save money. Bankrate's survey shows that 73% of Americans said they're saving less for unexpected expenses, compared with 68% in 2024.",
      "\"Though inflation is no longer rising as quickly as it did in recent years, more people this year feel the economy has affected their savings,\" according to the Bankrate report.",
      "Younger Americans tend to have the strongest concerns about their savings. A whopping 80% of Gen Zers worry about being able to cover immediate expenses if they were to suddenly lose their primary source of income, compared with 72% for Millennials and Gen Xers. Some 58% of Baby Boomers say they regularly fret about having enough money put away, a particular concern given that many are already retired.",
      "Borrower nation",
      "Only 41% of Americans said they would be able to tap their savings to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense, according to Bankrate's report. That's down 3% from 2024 and the lowest the percentage since 2021 (39%)",
      "Another 25% said they would use a credit card to pay for a $1,000 bill, 13% said they would turn to a family member for the money and 5% said they would take out a personal loan. In total, about 43% of respondents told Bankrate they would have to borrow money to pay for an emergency expense of $1,000.",
      "That's a concern given consumers collectively owe a record $1.14 trillion in credit card debt, figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u00a0show. Meanwhile, credit card rates continue to soar, hovering round 24%.",
      "\"The cost of living continues to rise, prompting more individuals and households to turn to credit cards when in a bind,\" Hamrick said. \"They are a terrific tool when used wisely and effectively. But with interest rates still high, we need to avoid a deepening debt burden which could make it more challenging to save.\"",
      "Another 13% of Americans said they would pay for a surprise $1,000 debt by curbing their spending, On a positive note, while 36% of adults said their credit card debt exceeded what they had in emergency savings, Bankrate found that more than half of survey respondents, at 55%, had more emergency savings in 2024 than credit card debt. That's the highest percentage since 2018.",
      "Asked how much they have in emergency savings, 28% of respondents said they had enough to cover six months of expenses; 16% said they had enough to cover three to five months; 29% had enough to cover less than three months' worth of bills; and 27% said they had no emergency savings at all.",
      "Tips for saving now",
      "For people who consider themselves among the roughly one-third of Americans who want to reduce their debt and boost their emergency savings in 2025, Bankrate offers three tips:",
      "Calculate how much you need to save.\u00a0As a general target, experts recommend saving three to six months' worth of expenses in case of emergencies. To figure out how much to put away, add the total amount you spend each month on food, housing, gas and other bills. So if your monthly bills amount to $2,000 a month, you'll need $6,000 in savings to stay afloat in case of an emergency, such as a job loss.",

      "As interest rates climbed, major banks charged borrowers more for mortgages and auto loans, yet never increased payouts to savers, despite telling lawmakers they would do so, say two U.S. senators in letters to seven CEOs, shared exclusively with CBS News.",
      "In March 2022, the Federal Reserve started raising the federal funds rate, with banks following suit by hiking rates for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. But those increases were not matched with high interest rate payouts on savings accounts at banks including Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo, according to the lawmakers.",
      "\"This tactic \u2014 charging borrowers more, paying savers a little, and pocketing interest paid by the Federal Reserve \u2014 has enabled U.S. banks to rake in record profits of $1 trillion and JPMorgan alone to make record profits of $49.6 billion in 2023,\" according to Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island), the authors of the letters. Meanwhile, \"savers have struggled to keep up with inflation,\" they added.",
      "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and his counterparts at half a dozen other financial institutions\u00a0testified\u00a0before the Senate Banking Committee in September of 2022 that their respective banks expected to increase rates for savers, albeit at a slower pace. While interest rates on the accounts JPMorgan keeps at the Fed rose from 3.15% to 4.65%, JPMorgan's customers continue to earn .01% on their savings, the lawmakers stated.",
      "\"These banks pledged in front of the United States Congress they would meaningfully pass on higher savings rates to their customers after hiking the cost of loans to pad their profits. Families across the country are struggling with inflation \u2014 these CEOs need to keep their word, not double-dip at the expense of their customers' savings,\" Warren told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "\"Experts have called megabanks' current net interest income a 'Goldilocks situation,' where banks have benefitted from higher Federal Reserve interest rates and kept deposit rates low,\" Warren and Reed noted in their letters, which called on the CEOs to explain what portion of their compensation had been based on their banks' \"interest-rate profiteering over the last two years.\"",
      "Wells Fargo declined to comment, while none of the other six banks responded to requests for comment.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 13:30:15 -0500",
    "summary": "The Sackler family will pay the vast majority of the settlement \u2014 a total of $6.5 billion over 15 years.",
    "story": [
      "The Sackler family and Purdue Pharma, the maker of the addictive painkiller oxycontin, have reached a $7.4 billion settlement with a bipartisan coalition of 15 states for fueling the opioid crisis, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday.",
      "The settlement bars the Sackler family from selling opioids in the U.S. and ends its control of Purdue. This comes seven months after the Supreme Court overturned a prior deal with Purdue that would have given the Sackler family immunity from future opioid lawsuits, a provision that is not part of the new deal.",
      "This is the largest settlement with contributors to the opioid crisis in the U.S. The Sackler family will pay the vast majority of the settlement \u2014 a total of $6.5 billion over 15 years \u2014 while Purdue will pay nearly $900 million up front, if it's approved by the court.",
      "Over half of the settlement will be distributed over the first few years, including almost $3 billion from the Sacklers. The Sacklers will make a $1.5 billion initial payment, adding another $500 million after one year, $500 million after two years and the remaining $400 million after three years.",
      "The funds will go to communities nationwide to support opioid addiction treatment, prevention and recovery programs over the next 15 years.",
      "\"Families throughout New York and across the nation are suffering from the immense pain and loss wrought by the opioid crisis,\" James said in a release announcing the settlement Thursday. \"The Sackler family relentlessly pursued profit at the expense of vulnerable patients and played a critical role in starting and fueling the opioid epidemic. While no amount of money will ever fully repair the damage they caused, this massive influx of funds will bring resources to communities in need so that we can heal.\"",
      "\"The Sacklers' no longer have control of Purdue will never be allowed to sell opioids in the United States again,\" she added.",
      "The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The states involved in the settlement will appoint a board of trustees to oversee the company and determine its future.",
      "The previous Purdue bankruptcy settlement was struck down by the Supreme Court in June 2024. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic. The original settlement would have required the Sacklers and Purdue to pay over $4.5 billion.",
      "\"Hundreds of millions of dollars that would have gone to victims was stuck, and we had to go back to square one,\" said Cheryl Juaire, a mother who lost two sons to opioid addiction, at a press conference with James announcing the settlement.",
      "\"Three and a half years ago, in the midst of this case, I lost my second son Sean, also to an overdose. I buried him in the midst of an ongoing mediation,\" she said. \"I truly hope that no one ever has to feel the devastation I have felt in losing two of my three children.\"",
      "Juaire noted that the new deal is \"even more than the original deal\" but emphasized that \"this will only happen if the parties that stood in the way the last time will not do so again.\"",
      "James has secured up to $250 million for New York from the settlement to support opioid treatment and recovery programs. She negotiated the settlement along with attorney generals from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.",
      "\"I will continue to go after the companies that caused the opioid epidemic and fight to get justice for those who have suffered,\" said James.",

      "More than two years after recalling about 1.7 million Ionic smartwatches sold globally, Google-owned Fitbit will pay a $12.2 million penalty for failing to alert consumers that the products can overheat and cause burns, federal regulators said Thursday.",
      "Fitbit received numerous reports of the lithium-ion batteries in the watches overheating during 2018, 2019 and continuing into 2020, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). In early 2020, Fitbit made an update to address the defect, but continued to hear from people suffering burns and did not report the issue to regulators as legally required.",
      "\"While health-conscious people wore Fitbit Ionic smartwatches to track their fitness, they had no idea that the watches were putting their safety at risk. They didn't know about the hazard because Fitbit said nothing,\" CPSC Commissioner Rich Trumka Jr. said Thursday in a statement.",
      "The CPSC and Fitbit announced a recall of the Ionic smartwatches in March of 2020, saying the company had received 115 reports in the U.S. of the batteries in the devices overheating. Domestic customers reported 78 burn injuries, two involving third-degree burns and four of second-degree burns; another 40 incidents were reported internationally.",
      "Fitbit discontinued production of its Ionic model, which was used to track activity, heart rate and sleep, in 2020.",

      "About 1 million of the recalled smartwatches were sold in the U.S. at retailers including Best Buy, Kohl's and Target, as well as online at Amazon.com and Fitbit.com from September 2017 through December 2021. The products retailed for between $200 and $330 each. Another 693,000 were sold internationally, according to the company.",
      "The 2020 recall came eight years after Fitbit\u00a0recalled\u00a0its Fitbit Force activity-tracking wristband after the company received roughly 9,900 reports of the wristband irritating skin and 250 reports of blistering.",
      "In addition to the $12.25 million civil penalty, the settlement agreement requires Fitbit to maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure compliance with the Consumer Product Safety Act. The company also agreed to submit an annual report regarding its compliance program and internal controls, the CPSC stated.",

      "Mr. Trump's 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration's close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well.",
      "The comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported early Thursday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, came in a phone call with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"The crown prince affirmed the kingdom's intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,\" the report said.",
      "The readout didn't elaborate on where those investments and trade could be placed. The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which were the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports, as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment.",
      "There was no immediate readout from the White House on the call. It also wasn't immediately clear if Mr. Trump's call with the crown prince was his first with a foreign leader since re-entering the White House. However, it was the first such call to be reported.",
      "The crown prince, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early Thursday.",
      "On Monday after his inauguration, Mr. Trump talked about possibly heading to the kingdom again as his first foreign trip, as he did in 2017.",
      "\"The first foreign trip typically has been with the U.K. but ... I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,\" Mr. Trump told journalists in the Oval Office. \"If Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 - we'll up it for all the inflation - I think I'd probably go.\"",

The kingdom also had been talking for years with the Biden administration about a wider deal to recognize Israel in exchange for U.S. defense protections and other support.",

    "story": [
      "In one of his first acts after returning to the Oval Office this week, President Trump tasked federal agencies with developing ways to potentially ease prices for U.S. consumers. But experts warn that his administration's crackdown on immigration could both drive up inflation as well as hurt a range of businesses by shrinking the nation's workforce.",
      "\"A reduction in labor supply means upward pressure on wages, which has different sector implications including inflationary pressure, especially for food prices,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said labor shortages stemming from the Trump administration's push to remove undocumented immigrants could curtail the production of some products and services.",
      "\"Ultimately, the main way immigration affects inflation is that if jobs are left open and production is unable to keep up with demand, that's going to lead to higher prices,\" he said.",
      "What sectors depend most on immigrant labor?",
      "According to\u00a0estimates\u00a0from the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies of New York and other groups, roughly 8.3 million undocumented immigrants work in the U.S, or just over 5% of the country's workforce.",
      "Undocumented immigrants account for about 20% of the agriculture industry's overall workforce, although that figure can rise to roughly half for some speciality farms, according to Capital Economics, which advises large investors.",
      "\"It's the key sector that comes up time and time again,\" Brown said, noting that harvesting delicate fruit is more labor-intensive than, for example, growing cereal crops. That means mass deportations could lead to price hikes in the fruit aisle.",
      "\"The inflationary impact could affect food overall, but particularly fresher fruits, rather than the ingredients in more processed foods,\" he said.",
      "Construction companies, including businesses focused on home renovations and landscaping, have the next highest share of undocumented workers and would also likely face a labor shortage if the government clamps down.",
      "\"With regard to home improvement projects those prices, they might become unaffordable to the point where people feel they can't do them anymore. And the lack of supply will be a big issue there, too,\" Brown said.",
      "Restaurants and food service businesses, which employ large numbers of undocumented workers, could be at particular risk if deportations flare. A shortage of workers would likely force such enterprises, including millions of small eateries around the U.S., to raise their wages to attract new employees. But that would also lead to hikes in menu prices, potentially driving away customers.",
      "\"They don't necessarily have the ability to bid up wages, so it might be that those places just shut down because they don't have the labor,\" Brown said.",
      "\"Removing large numbers of immigrants would drastically reduce the labor force, which could lead to rising wages, but potentially just higher prices for food, building and repairing homes, hotel stays and more things Americans hope to see lower prices for,\" added Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "That's because there are some jobs where even higher pay generally fails to attract U.S. born workers, like farming. \"Wages might not rise and instead we'd just see a short-term lack of availability of workers for harvesting crops,\" she said.",
      "Bier of the Cato Institute notes that removing undocumented workers could also have a ripple effect on legally employed workers. For example, the construction industry has an estimated 2 million undocumented workers, but their bosses are mostly Americans.",
      "\"A lot of immigrants do jobs that support jobs held by Americans,\" he said.",
      "\"The same thing is true in hospitality. Americans are more likely to be in management and supervisory roles, so if you pull a bunch of workers you're supervising, there will be fewer jobs for those supervisors and you'll see everyone leveling down,\" Bier added. \"The economic effects are going to be much more diffuse than people expect.\"",

    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the new $500 billion Stargate AI venture from OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle on Tuesday, he promised it would ensure \"the future of technology\" in the U.S. So far, Wall Street appears to agree, with some analysts speculating about its potential to transform the tech industry.",
      "But the project is also sparking some questions and skepticism, including pointed criticism from one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\"They don't actually have the money,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media app he owns. \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\"",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman countered that claim,\u00a0replying to Musk, \"wrong, as you surely know.\"",
      "Whatever the case might be, there are plenty of questions swirling about Stargate, which takes its name from a science-fiction movie and TV show about portals that transport people to other galaxies.",
      "At a White House briefing on Tuesday for the project's announcement, the executives behind the venture described Stargate as an AI project that could also prove to be transformative, albeit via Earth-based tech rather than intergalactic travel.",
      "\"This will help people's lives. This will help solve many, many issues ... with the power of AI,\" said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who joined Mr. Trump at the briefing, along with Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.",
      "\"I think this will be the most important project of this era,\" added Altman.",
      "Here's what we know about the project so far.",
      "What is the Stargate project?",
      "Stargate is a venture that has the backing of OpenAI, Oracle and Japanese company Softbank, with the latter promising an initial investment of $100 billion, according to Tuesday's announcement.",
      "The goal, said Son, is to ramp that investment to $500 billion within 4 years, or before the end of Mr. Trump's current term.",
      "Softbank will hold financial responsibility for the project, while OpenAI will oversee the operations, according to a research note from Capital Economics chief economist John Higgins. \"Donald Trump's ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of his second presidency,\" he noted.",
      "Where will Stargate be located?",
      "Stargate investment will be directed toward constructing data centers to support AI development, according to the announcement.",
      "Already, there are data centers under construction in Texas, with the first one located in Abilene, Oracle's Ellison said at the press conference. The goal is to construct 10 data centers initially, with plans to expand to 20 locations of about half a million square feet each, he added.",
      "Other potential sites for data centers across the nation are also being evaluated, according to a person familiar with the project.",
      "What type of projects will Stargate AI pursue?",
      "The data centers will be used by OpenAI, according to the person familiar with the project.",
      "During the press conference, Ellison highlighted AI's ability to transform health care, saying that the tools provided by OpenAI and Softbank are helping to develop a cancer vaccine.",
      "\"You can do early cancer detection with a blood test, and, using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancer that is seriously threatening the person,\" Ellison said. \"Once we gene sequence that gene tumor, you can vaccinate the person against that cancer, and you can make that mRNA vaccine robotically using AI within 48 hours.\"",
      "How many jobs could Stargate create?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed the venture would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately,\" while OpenAI, in a statement on its website, says Stargate will \"create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\"",
      "New hires for the project will be situated close to the data center locations, according to the person familiar with the venture. Stargate will hire people for construction, operations and other areas, they said.",
      "What is President Trump's AI policy?",
      "Mr. Trump is signaling a sharp divergence from former President Biden's AI policy. Within hours after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing Biden's guardrails for the fast-developing technology.",
      "What will come next from Mr. Trump and how it will diverge from his predecessor's effort to safeguard AI technology remains unclear. The new administration didn't respond to requests for comment about the repealed Biden policy.",
      "Even so, Wall Street interpreted the Stargate project as a sign the Trump administration will encourage investment and growth of the AI sector, especially as a way to bolster the nation's AI capabilities as it competes with China for tech dominance.",
      "\"The key role of Softbank, a Japanese company, in Stargate, highlights how Trump isn't hell-bent on excluding foreign firms from participating in America's quest for dominance in AI \u2013 provided they are headquartered in countries that are close allies of the U.S.,\" Capital Economics' Higgins wrote.",
      "He added, \"The new president seems much less keen than his predecessor on imposing checks and balances on the spread of AI.\"",
      "Why are some skeptical about Stargate?",
      "Aside from Musk, others have raised questions about whether Stargate's investment will actually reach $500 billion, with Higgins of Capital Economics writing, \"Whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen.\"",
      "Musk also has a public feud with OpenAI and Altman, alleging in a lawsuit last year that the company and its CEO violated OpenAI's original mission statement by putting profits over benefiting humanity. After helping found OpenAI in 2015, Musk broke with the company, claiming that the AI firm had veered away from its founding agreement that it would use its technology to benefit the public and that it would open its technology for public use.",

      "Diane Yentel, the president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, issued a statement on social media calling the order a \"potential 5-alarm fire for nonprofits.\"",
      "\"From pausing research on cures for childhood cancer to closing homeless shelters, halting food assistance, reducing safety from domestic violence, and shutting down suicide hotlines, the impact of even a short pause in funding could be devastating and cost lives,\" Yentel said. \"This order could decimate thousands of organizations and leave neighbors without the services they need.\"",
      "The memo is likely to prompt legal challenges from entities who were set to receive the now-frozen funds, and they could come quickly. Orders from lower courts directing agencies to turn the spigot back on while legal proceedings continue could eventually lead the Justice Department to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "Critics of the most recent action from the Trump administration have argued that the budget office's move to temporarily withhold federal funds violates the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that lays out the framework for the president's ability to freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress.",

    "summary": "The directive to the CDC to halt communications with the World Health Organization was imposed to comply with President Trump's executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Staff across the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were ordered Monday to cut off all communications with the World Health Organization, multiple federal health officials confirmed to CBS News, to comply with President Trump's executive order last week.",
      "Beyond calling for the U.S. to begin the yearlong process to formally withdraw from funding the U.N. health agency, Mr. Trump's executive order had also instructed federal agencies to \"recall and reassign\" any U.S. government personnel from working with the WHO.",
      "The sweeping directive to implement the order was issued by the CDC's Deputy Director for Global Health John Nkengasong in an email Monday, one official said, pending further guidance for when and how exceptions might be carved out.",
      "CDC staff assigned to work for the WHO are also being told not to come into the office, the email said, pending further guidance from leadership.",
      "Mr. Trump has long been critical of the WHO, blaming the organization for mishandling COVID-19 and saying it gets too much money from the U.S., which donates the most of any country.",
      "At an event in Las Vegas on Jan. 25, he said the WHO had offered to cut the U.S. funding commitment down to around the amount given by China.",
      "\"Maybe we would consider doing it again. I don't know. Maybe we would. They have to clean it up a little bit,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Former health officials tell CBS News they worry the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO could endanger efforts to respond to diseases, both undermining the U.N. agency and also making it harder for American officials to prepare.",
      "The first way U.S. officials would sometimes hear about worrying outbreaks was through the WHO, especially in countries wary of working with American authorities. The WHO also relies on disease experts dispatched by the U.S. and other countries to fill its ranks.",
      "\"As has been repeated many times, infectious diseases know no boundaries and in today's world of rapid travel, an outbreak anywhere is a threat everywhere,\" said James LeDuc, an adjunct professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch.",
      "Between working for the U.S. Army's medical research and heading the Galveston National Laboratory, LeDuc worked for CDC as a WHO medical officer and later one of the agency's top-ranking global health officials.",
      "\"The fact is that there is no alternative to WHO. WHO has the global mandate that allows health issues to be addressed on a global scale in a coordinated manner,\" LeDuc said.",
      "A World Health Organization spokesperson declined to comment on the move. The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Preparing for seasonal and pandemic influenza",
      "The gag order comes ahead of a key committee meeting next month, where CDC officials were scheduled to help the WHO pick out strains for next winter's influenza vaccine.",
      "Influenza vaccine manufacturers and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rely on the data and findings by that panel to decide on the shots used every fall around the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "The CDC also plays a key role as a WHO \"collaborating center\" for flu, serving as one of the world's one of the world's top laboratories for testing and studying the virus.",
      "Many countries send samples of worrying influenza cases to the CDC's Atlanta laboratory for scrutiny of mutations that might pose a pandemic threat, like after deaths from bird flu or swine flu.",
      "Responding to viruses like polio and Marburg",
      "CDC staff assigned to work for the WHO often serve as liaisons with the agency's disease experts, offering insights into worrying new germs the WHO is responding to around the world.",
      "Others work with other countries to stomp out lingering diseases, like the Global Polio Eradication Initiative backed by both agencies.",
      "The WHO also plays a key role in issuing licenses and coordinating trials that allow for the use of medicines to respond to diseases, especially for smaller countries facing outbreaks of new diseases.",
      "Multiple former federal health officials said the WHO also played a key role in facilitating the response and rollout of a U.S. vaccine to respond to an outbreak of Marburg, an Ebola-like disease, in Rwanda last year.",
      "Authorities are closely watching another outbreak of Marburg this year in Tanzania, which the WHO announced confirming last week.",
      "Replacing U.S. expertise at the WHO",
      "\"The expertise provided by CDC and other U.S. government agencies is absolutely essential to the success of WHO activities and to the well-being of the United States,\" said LeDuc.",
      "LeDuc recalled that U.S. staff were once proud to don WHO uniforms, working steps away from scientists from former Cold War adversaries to stem emerging disease threats out of the international organization's Geneva office.",
      "\"I don't think we want, particularly as public health experts, to feel like they can only wave the U.S. flag in those positions. The reason why it worked is because we were able to be American and also to be global citizens,\" said Loyce Pace, director of global affairs for HHS under the Biden administration.",
      "Pace said there are hundreds of American health agency officials who work with the WHO. She said it is likely other countries will likely try to step to fill the void left by American public health officials.",
      "Another former federal official said China has been seeking to fill more posts within the U.N. agency, worrying some U.S. officials about how they may seek to use their positions.",
      "\"My hope is that there's a part of us that will continue to work to see that not as a weakness but as a strength, to distinguish us from other actors who don't have that approach and, frankly, have not been as effective in building partnerships to protect the world,\" said Pace.",

      "The GOP letter came after Costco shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that the wholesale club operator evaluate any risks associated to its DEI practices.

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is expected to vote Tuesday on the confirmation of former Rep. Sean Duffy as transportation secretary, with wide bipartisan support expected, as some of President Trump's more controversial nominees face confirmation hearings this week.",
      "Duffy, 53, represented Wisconsin in the Senate from 2011 to 2019 and previously served as the district attorney of Ashland County, Wisconsin. He joined Fox News as a contributor and co-hosted a show on Fox Business after leaving Congress, until President Trump announced his selection for transportation secretary. He and his wife, whom he met on a reality television show, have nine children.",
      "The Senate voted unanimously to advance Duffy Monday night, after he appeared before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee earlier this month. At the hearing, he was introduced by the two Wisconsin senators \u2014 Republican Ron Johnson and Democrat Tammy Baldwin.",
      "\"I am confident that Sean is the right person for this job in this upcoming administration,\" Baldwin said, adding that Duffy will work with \"both sides of the aisle to improve our infrastructure and address the challenges that arise in the years ahead.\"",
      "Duffy said in his opening statement that \"transportation impacts every aspect of life,\" pledging that with Mr. Trump and support from Congress, \"I would hope to usher in a golden age of transportation and travel.\"",
      "\"President Trump, he's a builder. He wants to invest in rebuilding our nation's crumbling infrastructure,\" Duffy said, adding that Trump asked him to focus on the \"big, the durable projects that connect our country and connect our people.\"",
      "Duffy said he would work to reduce red tape that slows critical infrastructure projects. And he pledged to prioritize road safety and keep safety as a top priority in aviation. He urged that the nation needs to modernize its systems, pledging to work to restore global confidence in Boeing and \"ensure that our skies are safe.\"",
      "\"Transportation is an extraordinary new era we're entering in,\" Duffy said. \"We're in a global race to out-innovate and out-compete the rest of the world. If confirmed, we will craft clear regulations which balance safety, innovation and cutting edge technology, but always focused on safety.\"'",
      "Duffy has received widespread bipartisan support for his confirmation. Senate Majority Leader John Thune praised Duffy Monday as a five-term congressman and a co-chair of the Great Lakes task force, whom he said \"worked with Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate on a number of infrastructure projects.\"",
      "\"Mr. Duffy brings valuable experience that will help him in managing our nation's sprawling transportation system,\" Thune said. \"And he has some important work ahead of him.\"",

      "He also signed an executive order to establish a process to develop what the administration is calling an American Iron Dome \u2014 a missile defense shield for the homeland. (Iron Dome is the name often used for\u00a0Israel's system\u00a0for intercepting rockets, which was developed with U.S. support.)",
      "Mr. Trump signed the four orders aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington from a stop in Florida.",

About 8,200 service members were discharged for refusing to comply with the Pentagon's COVID-19 vaccine mandate, according to data provided by the service branches. However, the mandate was rescinded in January 2023 by the Biden administration, and since then, about 110 service members have rejoined the military.",
      "The president also signed an executive order directing the Pentagon to determine a policy for transgender service members based on readiness within 30 days. The action does not immediately ban transgender service members; however, it does state that the Defense Department's policy for troop readiness is \"inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria.\"",
      "The order also states that identifying as a gender that is \"inconsistent\" with one's biological sex \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life\" and that those doing so \"cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",
      "Speaking about his plans at a retreat with House Republicans Monday at his property in Doral, Florida, Mr. Trump said, \"To ensure we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It's going to be gone.\"",
      "SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit organization for trans service members and veterans, said in a\u00a0statement: \"Transgender service members have been serving openly for almost ten years, and currently fill critical roles in every branch and specialty, including infantry, aviation, nuclear engineering, law enforcement, and military intelligence, many requiring years of specialized training and expertise. ... The readiness and physical capabilities of transgender service members is not different from that of other service members.\"",
      "Another order addresses diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the military, banning the use of race- or sex-based preferences in the armed forces, the Defense Department and the Homeland Security Department.",
      "\"I ordered the end to all of the lawless diversity, equity and inclusion nonsense policies across the government and all across the private sector and the military,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP retreat. \"We're getting it out and we've gotten it out pretty much. We did that in one week, and it wasn't that easy, but everybody wanted it.\"",
      "Under this order, the defense secretary and homeland security secretary are to review the curriculum at the service academies and other academic institutions to ensure DEI and \"gender ideologies\" are eliminated.",

      "Parents enrolling children in Oklahoma public schools would be required to provide proof of their child's U.S. citizenship or legal immigration status under a proposal aimed at helping President Trump's immigration policies.",
      "The proposed rules, which Oklahoma's education board was set to vote on Tuesday, are in the early stages and would still need approval from lawmakers and the governor to take effect. The proposal from Republican State Superintendent Ryan Walters, the state's education chief, wouldn't prohibit students without legal status from attending schools but would require districts to keep a tally.",
      "A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1982 affirmed the right of children living in the country illegally to attend public schools, although some conservative lawmakers have questioned whether immigrants without legal residency should have the right to a public education.",
      "Walters has said he would support efforts by Mr. Trump to enforce immigration laws, including allowing federal agents with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement into Oklahoma schools. But there haven't been any instances yet of immigration agents entering schools in Oklahoma, reports CBS Tulsa affiliate KOTV.",
      "\"Schools are crippled by the flood of illegal immigrants and the Biden/Harris open border policy,\" Walters said in a statement. \"Oklahomans and the country elected President Trump and we will do everything possible to help put Oklahoma students first.\"",
      "Walters has spent much of his first term in office attacking what he describes as \"woke\" ideology in public schools, requiring Bible instruction in Oklahoma classrooms and attempting to ban books from school libraries.",

      "\"The community is scared, obviously,\" Alonso-Sandoval said. \"The conversations I've had with parents, all they're doing is trying to provide the best opportunity for their kids, like any parents. They are starting to question: Do I unenroll my child from school?\"",
      "At Oklahoma City Public Schools, one of the state's largest districts with a student population that is 57% Hispanic, Superintendent Jamie Polk said in a letter to parents and staff last month after the rule was first proposed that federal law guarantees every child's right to public education regardless of immigration status.",

      "Alabama attempted a similar requirement for public schools to ask the immigration status of students as part of a sweeping immigration law in 2011, but the state ultimately agreed to permanently block those provisions after they had been temporarily halted by a federal appeals court.",

    "story": [
      "About a dozen Justice Department employees who worked for former special counsel Jack Smith on the investigation and prosecution of President Trump are being fired, two sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. The federal prosecutors were informed of the decision to terminate their positions via a letter sent over email after Justice Department leadership determined they were unable to carry out Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "\"Acting Attorney General James McHenry made this decision because he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,\" a Justice Department official told CBS News.",
      "Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 and took over two ongoing investigations of the president, one related to his handling of classified records and the other tied to his conduct following the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Both cases were dismissed after Mr. Trump won the 2024 presidential election. Smith informed the judges overseeing the cases that Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Throughout his probes, the former special counsel amassed a staff of prosecutors and agents to conduct grand jury investigations and try the cases in court. It is not immediately clear which members of Smith's team were fired, but the move makes good on a Trump campaign promise to clean house in the Justice Department. Last week, the president signed an executive order to take on the \"weaponization of the federal government,\" a characterization he applied to Smith's prosecutions.",
      "Fox News was first to report on the firings.",
      "The news of the firings came on the same day that Washington, D.C.'s top federal prosecutor launched an internal review of the charging decisions behind hundreds of Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot cases. Two people familiar with the move confirmed to CBS News that Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin ordered prosecutors in his office to turn in documents, emails and other information related to the previous administration's decision to bring an obstruction charge against more than 200 Capitol attack defendants.",
      "The cases at issue are those in which defendants were charged with obstruction of an official proceeding, a charge that the Supreme Court later ruled was too broadly applied by federal prosecutors.",
      "Throughout the sprawling Jan. 6 investigation that abruptly came to an end last week after President Trump pardoned more than 1,500 individuals, defendants and their attorneys brought challenges against the obstruction case on multiple fronts as they contested the Justice Department's application of the law in the Capitol riot cases. The Supreme Court ultimately limited prosecutors' use of the statute.",
      "The new review is set to examine the decision making behind the use of that charge, the people said.",
      "News of the review was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "The U.S. attorney's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Smith \u2014 who resigned from his position following the completion of his investigation \u2014\u00a0 wrote in his report on the probe that his team had collected evidence \"sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial,\" if the case involving Mr. Trump's alleged conduct around the 2020 election had gone to trial.",
      "Only the first volume of Smith's report, which described the investigation into Mr. Trump's post-2020 election conduct, was released to the public. The second volume is currently shielded from public view while an appeal in the classified documents case is ongoing.",
      "In the report, Smith defended his work as apolitical. And in a letter accompanying the final draft, he wrote, \"To all who know me well, the claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called Smith \"desperate\" and \"deranged\" and consistently denied wrongdoing throughout the investigations.",
      "Also on Monday, the chief of the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section resigned from his position after being reassigned, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. The official was appointed to the position during the first Trump administration, and his political corruption unit later advised Smith on various aspects of cases against Mr. Trump, according to court documents.",
      "NBC News first reported the resignation. The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "summary": "Senate Democrats are asking for documents related to allegations the nominee to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, prematurely confirmed hostage rescue details.",
    "story": [
      "Days before this week's high-stakes confirmation hearing of Kash Patel to be FBI director, a bureau insider has come forward with new information questioning Patel's judgment during sensitive hostage rescue missions, CBS News has learned.",
      "The whistleblower, whose identity is being withheld by Senate Democrats for fear of retaliation, worked with the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which leads the government's missions to rescue hostages overseas. The whistleblower alleges that Patel violated firmly entrenched protocols to keep such operations under wraps until the captives are safely in U.S. hands and their families have been notified.",
      "In a letter obtained by CBS News, Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote that Patel, while serving on the National Security Council during the first Trump term, \"broke protocol regarding hostage rescues by publicly commenting without authorization on the then-in-progress retrieval of two Americans held captive by Iranian-backed militants in Yemen in October 2020.\"",
      "According to the letter, on Oct. 14 at 10:55 a.m., the Wall Street Journal published a story in which Patel confirmed that the two American captives and the remains of a third were exchanged for two hundred Houthi fighters who were being held in Saudi Arabia. According to the letter, the news report was published \"several hours before the hostages were in the confirmed custody of the United States.\" In the end the Americans returned home safely, but FBI officials involved in the mission were livid over Patel's leak, which they regarded as reckless and potentially risking tragic results.",
      "Democratic senators sent the letter Monday morning to Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Acting Treasury Secretary David Lebryk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. It asks for all records of communications between Patel and the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell concerning the rescue of the captives, as well as any records reflecting authorization for him to disclose the hostage deal before there was confirmation that the Americans were safely in U.S, hands.",
      "No Republican senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee signed the letter.",
      "A source close to the confirmation said in response to the allegations, \"Mr. Patel was a public defender, decorated prosecutor and accomplished national security official that kept Americans safe. He has a track record of success in every branch of government, from the court room to congressional hearing room to the situation room. There is no veracity to this anonymous source's complaints about protocol.\"",
      "Alex Gray, former chief of staff for the National Security Council during the first Trump administration, said in a statement, \"The anonymous allegations in this letter are simply absurd to anyone who has ever actually worked with Kash Patel. In everything he did at the NSC and DoD, Kash put the interests of the American people, and particularly the interests of American hostages and unlawful detainees and their families, first.\"",
      "\"The success President Trump and his NSC had on the counter terrorism and hostage recovery missions was in no small part due to Kash's skill and professionalism,\" Gray said. He referred to the whistleblower's allegations as \"baseles\" and \"the last gasp of discredited political opponents of President Trump.\"",
      "The Durbin letter offers a glimpse into the Democratic strategy for Thursday's confirmation hearing. Knowledgeable sources tell CBS News that senators will seek to show that Patel has engaged in a pattern of poor judgment and self-aggrandizement regarding sensitive life-and-death missions and use that portrayal to cast doubt on his fitness to lead the FBI.",
      "The letter says any official \"who puts missions or the lives of Americans in jeopardy for public notoriety and personal gain is unfit to lead the country's primary federal law enforcement and investigative agency.\"",
      "The Democrats plan to highlight another instance where Patel has been criticized for his handling of a sensitive operation aimed at freeing American captives. Two weeks after the Yemen hostage deal, Patel found himself in the middle of another high-risk operation. Philip Walton was a 27-year-old American who had been seized by armed men at his farm in Niger, near the Nigerian border.",
      "The kidnappers transported Walton to Nigeria and demanded a million dollars in ransom. There were also indications that the kidnappers were contemplating turning him over to a terrorist group operating in the region. Patel was accompanying President Trump on a visit to Fort Bragg, the military installation in North Carolina that is home to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command. While they were there, Patel received intelligence that Walton would be held at an encampment for several hours, enough time to stage a daring Seal Team 6 raid to rescue the hostage. Mr. Trump signed off on the operation, which involved parachuting into Northern Nigeria and trekking for miles to the compound where Walton was being held.",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper had greenlit the plan, but there were still some final questions that needed to be answered before he could give the go order \u2013 primarily whether the Nigerian government had given the U.S. permission to use its air space. According to Esper's memoir, Patel, who was the senior director for counterterrorism at the time, assured Defense Department officials that the State Department had received the necessary permission from the Nigerians. But Patel's information was incorrect: the Nigerians had not given their approval.",
      "By this time, Air Force planes carrying the Navy SEALs were in the air just a few miles from the Nigerian border. Esper wrote in his memoir, \"A Sacred Oath,\" he realized the government had to make an agonizing decision. He told the White House they could go forward with the operation and risk having their planes shot down \u2014 or abort the mission and miss a crucial opportunity to save Walton.\u00a0 But at the last minute, word came that the State Department had received clearance to use Nigerian airspace. The mission went forward, was executed flawlessly, and Walton was returned to safety.",
      "But Esper and other officials were furious at the role Patel had played, believing he had inserted himself into the operation in violation of regular protocol, and then nearly botched it by transmitting false information. According to Esper's account, Patel's carelessness carried significant risk for the SEALs.",
      "\"I was concerned that being packed in an aircraft burning holes in the sky for an extra hour or so would wear on the special operators, that it might affect their readiness somehow,\" he wrote in his memoir.",
      "Esper also wrote of the incident, \"My team suspected Patel made the approval story up, but they didn't have all the facts.\"",
      "Patel has denied Esper's version of events. In his own book, \"Government Gangsters,\" Patel portrays Esper as a \"deep-state\" actor who \"always seemed to be subverting the president's agenda,\" including by putting up obstacles to counterterrorism raids in Africa and the Middle East.\" He argued that Mr. Trump had the ultimate authority to order the mission.",
      "Last week, Durbin met with Patel and asked him about Esper's account of his role in the nearly botched Nigerian raid. Sources said Patel again refuted Esper's version of events. Durbin did not yet have the whistleblower's information about the Yemen hostage deal, but he is expected to closely question the FBI nominee about that episode at Thursday's confirmation hearing.",
      "However Patel's answers those questions, there is no suspense as to how Durbin and his fellow Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote. After his meeting with Patel, Durbin issued a statement saying he will not vote to confirm Patel.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump will hold off on imposing steep tariffs on Colombia after the country's government agreed to accept deported migrants being returned on military planes, the White House said Sunday night.",
      "Mr. Trump earlier on Sunday vowed swift and punishing retaliation after the Colombian government over the weekend blocked the arrival of deportation flights from the U.S., objecting to the Trump administration's efforts to use military planes to deport migrants.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on social media on Sunday that his administration would put in place several actions against Colombia, including a 25% tariff \u2014 that he said would be raised to 50% after one week \u2014 on all goods coming into the U.S. from Colombia.",
      "He also announced a travel ban and \"immediate visa revocation\" for Colombian government officials and \"their allies,\" visa sanctions on Colombian authorities and their relatives and enhanced customs inspections on travelers and cargo from Colombia.",
      "\"These measures are just the beginning,\" Mr. Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States!\"",
      "But late Sunday night, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"The Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump's terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay. Based on this agreement, the fully drafted IEEPA tariffs and sanctions will be held in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to honor this agreement.\"",
      "\"The visa sanctions issued by the State Department, and enhanced inspections from Customs and Border Protection, will remain in effect until the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned,\" Leavitt's statement said.",
      "Colombia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement the country had \"overcome the impasse\" with the U.S., and said its foreign minister and ambassador would travel to Washington, D.C., \"in the next few hours\" to continue discussing the agreement.",
      "\"We will continue to receive Colombians who return as deportees, guaranteeing them dignified conditions, as citizens subject to rights,\" the Foreign Ministry said. The ministry's statement made no mention of U.S. military planes, but said Colombia's presidential plane would be used to return migrants who had been scheduled to be deported Sunday morning.",
      "A senior Trump administration official had earlier told CBS News the use of the presidential plane would not be enough to stave off Mr. Trump's proposed tariffs and sanctions.",
      "A senior administration official earlier Sunday said Mr. Trump's actions amounted to \"a clear message\" to countries that they \"have an obligation to accept repatriation flights.\"",
      "Prior to Sunday night's announced agreement, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said on social media \"Your blockade doesn't scare me,\" and said Colombia would respond to the raised tariffs with a 50% tariff of its own on U.S. goods. In reference to the travel ban, Petro said, \"I don't really like traveling to the U.S., it's a bit boring.\"",
      "Petro also predicted the U.S. could \"try to carry out a coup with your economic strength and your arrogance, like they did with Allende. ... Overthrow me, President, and the Americas and humanity will respond,\" Petro wrote.",
      "In a statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was Colombia's responsibility to take back citizens who are illegally in the U.S. \"in a serious and expeditious manner.\"",
      "\"Colombian President Petro had authorized flights and provided all needed authorizations and then canceled his authorization when the planes were in the air,\" Rubio said. \"As demonstrated by today's actions, we are unwavering in our commitment to end illegal immigration and bolster America's border security.\"",
      "Later Sunday, the State Department confirmed Rubio had \"ordered a suspension of visa issuance at the U.S. Embassy Bogota consular section.\"",
      "\"Secretary Rubio is now authorizing travel sanctions on individuals and their families, who were responsible for the interference of U.S. repatriation flight operations,\" the State Department said. \"Measures will continue until Colombia meets its obligations to accept the return of its own citizens. America will not back down when it comes to defending its national security interests.\"",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that U.S. Customs and Border Protection was already implementing a travel ban on Colombian government officials and diplomats traveling with what are known as A and G visas as of Sunday night. The agency had also started enhanced customs inspections on cargo from Colombia, the official added. CBP later confirmed those actions in a public statement.",
      "Earlier on Sunday, Petro said he rejected the deportation flights because the deportees were being transported in military aircraft, arguing such a move treated migrants as criminals.",
      "\"The United States must establish a protocol for the dignified treatment of migrants before we receive them,\" Petro wrote on social media. He added that he would accept deportation flights, as long as they were conducted on civilian planes.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS that the Colombian migrants who were scheduled to be deported on Sunday on these planes were back in the U.S. and will remain in DHS custody until a new agreement was reached.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News there were two Department of Defense planes with migrant deportees expected to land in Colombia on Sunday, after departing the San Diego area near the southern border. But those plans were scrapped overnight.",
      "One of the U.S. officials said the plan was to deport roughly 80 Colombian migrants on each military plane.",
      "Colombia's decision to block the U.S. deportation flights over the weekend was an early diplomatic setback for the Trump administration as it lays the foundation for its promised mass deportation campaign and crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "As part of that crackdown, President Trump has moved to vastly increase the role the U.S. military plays in immigration enforcement, declaring a national emergency to deploy an additional 1,500 Army soldiers and Marines to the southern border. The troops have been assigned to erect border barriers and help Customs and Border Protection in an operational capacity. Long-standing legal limits bar the use of soldiers for the civil enforcement of laws, including U.S. immigration law.",

    "story": [
      "The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic most likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has \"low confidence\" in its own conclusion.",
      "The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director.",
      "\"CIA assesses with low confidence that a research-related origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely than a natural origin based on the available body of reporting. CIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,\" a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement, noting they \"will continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information that could change CIA's assessment.\"",
      "Jake Sullivan, the Biden administration national security adviser, ordered a classified review in December of U.S. intelligence that had been gathered on the origins of COVID-19, one current and one former U.S. official confirmed to CBS News. Sullivan convened a panel of outside experts to assess the intelligence and asked the intelligence community to review its data and form a conclusion. Both officials told CBS News there was no new \"smoking gun,\" but rather a low-confidence assessment based on the same data. Burns ordered the review before leaving the CIA, citing high policymaker interest.",
      "The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory.",
      "Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities.",
      "Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs.",
      "China said Monday it disagreed with the assessment.",
      "\"The conclusion that a laboratory leak is extremely unlikely was reached by the China-WHO joint expert team based on field visits to relevant laboratories in Wuhan,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said. \"This has been widely recognized by the international community and the scientific community.\"",
      "U.S. lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths. It's a question with significant domestic and geopolitical implications as the world continues to grapple with the pandemic's legacy.",
      "Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Saturday he was \"pleased the CIA concluded in the final days of the Biden administration that the lab-leak theory is the most plausible explanation\" and he commended Ratcliffe for declassifying the assessment.",
      "\"Now, the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a plague on the world,\" Cotton said in a statement.",
      "Chinese authorities have dismissed speculation about COVID's origins as unhelpful and motivated by politics. On Saturday, a spokesperson for China's U.S. embassy said the CIA report has no credibility.",
      "\"We firmly oppose the politicization and stigmatization of the source of the virus, and once again call on everyone to respect science and stay away from conspiracy theories,\" embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press.",
      "While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably raccoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "Some official investigations, however, have raised the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago a report by the Energy Department concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding.",
      "The same year then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency believed the virus \"most likely\" spread after escaping from a lab.",
      "Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario, too.",
      "\"The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,\" Ratcliffe said in 2023.",

    "summary": "Perplexity is seeking to create a new $300-billion public company with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
    "story": [
      "Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok's parent company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "The proposal, submitted last week, is a revision of a prior plan the artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok's parent ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went into effect.",
      "The first proposal, which ByteDance hasn't responded to, sought to create a new structure that would merge San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
      "The new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity's proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.",
      "If the plan is successful, the shares owned by the government would not have voting power, the person said. The government also would not get a seat on the new company's board.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Under the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a \"full U.S. board control,\" the person said.",
      "Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok's U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.",
      "The proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during President Donald Trump's first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures \u2014 that a new investor in TikTok could simply \"dilute down\" the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.",
      "\"But the technology needs to be disconnected from China,\" he added. \"It needs to be disconnected from ByteDance. There's absolutely no way that China would ever let us have something like that in China.\"",
      "The Perplexity proposal comes as several investors are expressing interest in TikTok. Mr. Trump said late Saturday that he expects a deal will be made in as soon as 30 days.",
      "On\u00a0a flight from Las Vegas to Miami on Air Force One, Mr. Trump also said he hadn't discussed a deal with Larry Ellison, CEO of software maker Oracle, despite\u00a0a report\u00a0that Oracle, along with outside investors, was considering taking over TikTok's global operation.",
      "\"Numerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary. ... I'd only do it if the United States benefits.\"",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Mr. Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.",
      "Mr. Trump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \"right down the road\" from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \"I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I've spoken to many people about TikTok and there's great interest in TikTok.\"",
      "TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Mr. Trump said he would postpone the ban. Mr. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year's presidential election.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Mr. Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, along with some other tech leaders who've been forging friendlier ties with the new administration.",
      "Congress voted to ban TikTok in the U.S. out of concern that TikTok's ownership structure represented a security risk. The Biden administration argued in court for months that it was too much of a risk to allow a Chinese company to control the algorithm that fuels what people see on the app. Officials also raised concerns about user data collected on the platform.",
      "However, to date, the U.S. hasn't provided public evidence of TikTok handing user data to Chinese authorities or allowing them to tinker with its algorithm.",

His other executive actions, including the ICE order, could face legal challenges.",
      "However, it was the church and schools order that drew ire from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Mark. J Seitz, migration committee chairman U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, told CBS News \"Many of these policies we see going against the basic tenets of our faith.\"",
      "Vance, a devout Catholic, sharply rebuked the bishops' condemnation. \"Because as a practicing Catholic, I was actually heartbroken by that statement,\" he said.",
      "Vance told Brennan the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops \"has, frankly, not been a good partner in common sense immigration enforcement that the American people voted for.\"",
      "Brennan asked Vance if he specifically supported immigration agents going into churches and schools, and \"conducting a raid or enforcement action in a church service, at a school.\"",
      "Vance said he \"supports us doing law enforcement against violent criminals, whether they're illegal immigrants or anybody else, in a way that keeps us safe.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Mike Turner, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday that TikTok \"remains a national security threat\" despite President Trump's effort to maintain access to the popular video-sharing app in recent days.",
      "\"Let's be clear. Tiktok is absolutely a national security threat,\" Turner said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "TikTok briefly shut down services in the U.S. last week facing a divestment deadline for its China-based parent company, ByteDance. But within hours, TikTok began restoring service to users when Mr. Trump vowed to intervene. And on Monday, the newly sworn-in president signed an executive order directing the Justice Department not to enforce the law, which the Supreme Court recently upheld, for 75 days.",
      "Turner, an Ohio Republican, outlined the reasoning behind the law passed last year by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden that gave ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest or be cut off from U.S. app stores, saying that TikTok poses a national security risk on two fronts: \"its access to data and its ability to use itself as a propaganda tool.\"",
      "Turner argued that \"the only thing that would protect the United States and protect our citizens is divestiture,\" adding that \"the law that is the law of the land says that ByteDance needs to divest itself.\"",
      "Meanwhile, reports have circulated in recent days that the president is working on a deal to save TikTok through its sale. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One Saturday that \"numerous people\" are talking to him about buying TikTok, noting that he'll make a decision over the next 30 days. The president previously sought to ban the app over national security concerns during his first term.",
      "\"If we can save TikTok I think it would be a good thing,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he has a \"warm spot\" for the app, citing his support among young people.",
      "Asked Sunday about the possibility of the president reaching a deal, Turner said \"we certainly hope that he gets a deal that recognizes the issue of national security.\"",
      "\"There is no role in which they can remain active, in which China can have access to this data,\" Turner added.",
      "The comments come after Turner was ousted\u00a0by House Speaker Mike Johnson as Intelligence Committee chairman earlier this month. Turner said at the time that the speaker fired him citing \"concerns from Mar-a-Lago.\" But Johnson has denied the claim. And on Sunday, the Ohio Republican said he'd been in touch with the president's team and was informed \"that was not the case.\"",
      "\"The one thing that he has said is that he wanted to take the committee in a different direction,\" Turner said, adding that he's \"a little concerned\" that the new direction could include a focus on \"the elusive Deep State\" rather than national security.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation, our exclusive interview with the new vice president, J.D. Vance.",
      "Washington's been a whirlwind of activity in the first week of the Trump 2.0 administration. But what's real and what's just on the president's wish list?",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Vice President, if you're ready, we will dive right in.",
      "J.D. VANCE, (Vice President of the United States): Ready to go.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a new era of governing in the nation's capital. You will hear what the V.P. has to say about immigration, lowering prices for American consumers, reforming the agency that handles disaster aid, those tech titans supporting Trump, and the pardons of 1,500 people charged with crimes in the January 6 Capitol attack.",
      "Plus, House Republican Mike Turner and Democrat Jason Crow.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We want to get right to our interview with Vice President J.D. Vance, his first since taking office. We spoke with him yesterday in a ceremonial office adjacent to the White House.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Pete Hegseth, it was a tie, bipartisan opposition, smallest margin since the job was created. You had to break that tie.",
      "If the nominee can't unite your party, how is he going to lead three million people?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, look, I think Pete is a disrupter, and a lot of people don't like that disruption, but, Margaret, that disruption is incredibly necessary.",
      "If you think about all of those bipartisan massive votes, we have to ask ourselves, what did they get us? They got us a country where we fought many wars over the last 40 years, but haven't won a war about as long as I have been alive. They've got us a military with a major recruitment crisis, a procurement price crisis that's totally dysfunctional, where we buy airplanes for billions and billions of dollars, terrible cost overruns.",
      "The delivery dates are always delayed. So we need a big change. Now, admittedly, there are people who don't like that big change, but it is necessary, and it's explicitly what Donald J. Trump ran on and I think part of the reason why the American people elected him their 47th president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the main objective is changing all of that, that it's going to be Pete Hegseth alone?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I would say the main problem is \u2013 or \u2013 excuse me \u2013 the main thing that we want Pete Hegseth to do is to fix the problems at the Department of Defense. And, unfortunately, there are many.",
      "We've gotten into way too many wars that we don't have a plan for winning. We've gotten into way too many misadventures that we shouldn't have got into in the very first place. And our procurement process, Margaret, is incredibly broken. We're in an era\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are policy decisions.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, of course, they're policy decisions, but they're also logistical and implementation decisions.",
      "If you look at where we are with the rise of artificial intelligence, with the rise of drone technology and drone warfare, we have to really, top to bottom, change the way that we fund the procurement of weapons, the way that we arm our troops. This is a major period of disruption, and we think Pete Hegseth is the guy to lead the job.",
      "Now, there's another element to this, Margaret, too, which is we believe that military morale, at least until the election of President Trump, was historically low. You had the Army missing recruitment goals by tens of thousands of soldiers, and, already, recruitment is starting to pick up because Pete Hegseth is fundamentally a war fighter's leader at the Department of Defense.",
      "He is a guy who sees, not through the perspective of the generals or the bureaucrats. He looks at things through the perspective of the men and women that we send off to fight in our wars.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Both \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"The National Review,\" conservative publications, as you know, have been critical of Tulsi Gabbard.",
      "\"The Review\" called her an atrocious nominee who deserves to be defeated. They compared her defense of Edward Snowden, the fugitive, to \u2013 who stole U.S. secrets, to an attorney general who thinks the mob gets a bad rap.",
      "Her refusal to accept U.S. intelligence findings that Assad gassed his own people, they said was like a nominee for OMB director not being able to count.",
      "Does any of this give you pause putting her in charge of the U.S. intelligence community, yes or no?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: No, Margaret, look, these are publications that attacked Donald J. Trump obsessively, but those publications don't determine who the president is. The American people do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And ultimately supported him.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: And Donald J. Trump is the person who determines who his cabinet is, not these publications that I think, frankly, have lost relevance.",
      "Here's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Senate will ultimately decide.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Here's Tulsi Gabbard's \u2013 well, the Senate will provide advice and consent, as is its constitutional obligation, but I feel confident that Tulsi Gabbard will ultimately get through.",
      "Two things that are important to know about Tulsi. First of all, she is a career military servant who's had a classification at the highest levels for nearly two decades. She has impeccable character, impeccable record of service, and she also is a person who I think is going to bring some trust back to the intelligence services.",
      "The bureaucrats at our intelligence services have gotten completely out of control. They've been part of the weaponization of our political system, the weaponization of our justice system. We need to have good intelligence services who keep us safe, but part of that is restoring trust in those services, and we think Tulsi is the right person to do it.",
      "That's why the president\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She doesn't trust those intelligence services.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: She recognizes the bureaucrats have gotten out of control, and we need somebody there who's going to rein them in and return those services to their core mission of identifying information that's going to keep us safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You campaigned on lowering prices for consumers. We've seen all of these executive orders. Which one lowers prices?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: We have done a lot.",
      "And there have been a number of executive orders that have caused, already jobs to start coming back into our country, which is a core part of lowering prices. More capital investment, more job creation in our economy is one of the things that's going to drive down prices for all consumers, but also raise wages, so that people can afford to buy the things that they need.",
      "If you look at our slate of executive orders\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, grocery prices aren't going to come down?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: No, Margaret, prices are going to come down, but it's going to take a little bit of time, right?",
      "The president has been president for all of five days. I think that, in those five days, he's accomplished more than Joe Biden did in four years. It's been an incredible breakneck pace of activity. We're going to work with Congress. We're, of course, going to have more executive orders, and we're going to try \u2013 the way that you \u2013 you lower prices is that you encourage more capital investment into our country.",
      "And you asked specifically, what executive order is going to help lower prices. All of the stuff that we've done on energy, to explore more energy reserves, to develop more energy resources in the United States of America. One of the main drivers of increased prices under the Biden administration is that we had a massive increase in energy prices.",
      "Donald Trump has already taken multiple executive actions that are going to lower energy prices, and I do believe that means consumers are going to see lower prices at the pump and at the grocery store, but it's going to take a little bit of time. Rome wasn't built in a day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: And while we've done a whole lot, we can't undo all of the damage of Joe Biden's presidency in four days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there were a lot of things that contributed to higher energy prices. And there was record oil and gas production.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Yes, Joe Biden did many\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the price of eggs\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 many terrible things to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 the things that people see\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 lead to an increase in prices. I agree, Margaret.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but all the things you experience at the grocery store are what people touch and feel. That's what \u2013 you were talking about bacon on the campaign trail.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Of course. Of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those things, when do consumers actually get to touch and feel a difference in their lives?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, but, Margaret, how does bacon get to the grocery store? It comes on trucks that are fueled by diesel fuel. If the diesel is way too expensive, the bacon is going to become more expensive. How do we grow the bacon? Our farmers need energy to produce it.",
      "So, if we lower energy prices, we are going to see lower prices for consumers, and that is what we're trying to fight for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the flurry of executive orders, most of them weren't about the economy. Many of them\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Many of them were, though, Margaret. We had \u2013 I think we've had \u2013 we've taken over\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You had a promise of tariffs by February 1.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: We've taken over 200 executive actions, some executive orders, other executive actions. Again, this is in less than a week, and a lot of them were focused on the economy, bringing investment into our country and lowering energy prices.",
      "We've also focused on safety, restoring public safety, ending weaponization of the Department of Justice. We've done a lot. And I think the president is to be commended for actually coming in and doing something with this incredible mandate the American people gave him. He's not sitting in the Oval Office doing nothing. He's doing the American people's business. And I think they're going to see a lot of good effects from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a lot of these announcements have yet to take effect.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president did say he wants to do something with an executive order in relation to federal emergency response. He said he may reform or eliminate FEMA.",
      "Instead of sending emergency responders, he may start to send a percentage of money to states to take care of themselves. But you know FEMA has specialized expertise that some of these states just don't have\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Oh, Margaret, I\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 in their arsenal.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I wish that they\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And how will states who are \u2013 who are lower-income states, the Mississippis, the Kentuckys, the Alabamas, be able to do this for themselves without federal help?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, the president, to be clear, is not saying we're going to leave anybody behind.",
      "He's saying that, in the way that we administer these resources, some of which is coming from the federal level, some of which is coming from the state level, we've got to get the bureaucrats out of the way and get the aid to the people who need it most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are the first responders.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Let's be honest, Margaret. You talk about the expertise from FEMA. FEMA in North Carolina, in California, in Florida with some of the hurricanes has often been a disaster. And it's not because we don't have good people at FEMA.",
      "It's because bureaucratic red tape and garbage prevents the rapid deployment of resources to the people who need it the most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the states are now going to have to do this themselves?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: The president is trying to encourage us to reform the way that we deliver emergency response in a way that gets resources to people who need it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, don't take him literally, is what you're saying?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: No, we should take the president at his word that FEMA needs desperate reform, because it does.",
      "Margaret, when I went to North Carolina as V.P.-elect, but before we were sworn in, people would talk about how FEMA would get resources, food, medicine, water to a warehouse, but then would have no plan to get it from the warehouse to the people in the mountains who were literally starving and thirsting to death.",
      "We can do so much better. And, under Donald Trump's leadership, we will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they work with the state and local officials. So, now\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: They often don't work well enough. And, again, that's not because of the\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 it's going to be on the state and local officials?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: They \u2013 no, the FEMA management officials don't work well enough with state and local officials to get resources to the people who need it.",
      "We should expect \u2013 and this is, I think, one of the fundamental premises of President Trump's leadership. The American people should expect more of their government. When there's a terrible disaster, they should expect food, medicine and water to get to the people who need it.",
      "When there's a terrible fire in California, the fire hydrants ought to actually turn on. I am sick of the American people having such low expectations for their government. They should demand more of us, because it's the greatest country in the world, and that's what Donald Trump's leadership promises to bring back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So still count on the federal government, but watch that space.",
      "Let me ask you about another area that you campaigned on quite a lot, and there was a flurry of activity on. And that has to do with immigration.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops this week condemned some of the executive orders signed by President Trump, specifically those allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enter churches and to enter schools.",
      "Do you personally support the idea of conducting a raid or enforcement action in a church service, at a school?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, let me \u2013 let me address this.",
      "Of course, if you have a person who is convicted of a violent crime, whether they're an illegal immigrant or a non-illegal immigrant, you have to go and get that person to protect the public safety. That's not unique to immigration.",
      "But let me just address the \u2013 this particular issue, Margaret, because, as a practicing Catholic, I was actually heartbroken by that statement. And I think that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns, or are they actually worried about their bottom line?",
      "We're going to enforce immigration law. We're going to protect the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Donald Trump promised to do that. And I believe the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, if they're worried about the humanitarian costs of immigration enforcement, let them talk about the children who have been sex-trafficked because of the wide-open border of Joe Biden.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you \u2013 you personally support them going into schools and churches?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Let them talk about people like Laken Riley, who were brutally murdered.",
      "I support us doing law enforcement against violent criminals, whether they're illegal immigrants or anybody else, in a way that keeps us safe. Let me ask this question, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Let's separate the immigration issue. If you had a violent murderer in a school, of course I want law enforcement\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 to go and get that person out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: So, then what's the point of the question?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You changed the regulation this week. That's the point of the question.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Exactly, to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Giving the authority to go into churches\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Yes, exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and go into schools.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: We empowered law enforcement to enforce the law everywhere to protect Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that also has a knock-on effect, a chilling effect, arguably, to people to not send their kids to school.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I \u2013 I desperately hope it has a chilling effect\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the churches\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 on illegal immigrants coming into our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think the U.S. Conference of Catholics Bishops is \u2013 are actively hiding criminals from law enforcement?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I think the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has, frankly, not been a good partner in commonsense immigration enforcement that the American people voted for.",
      "And I hope, again, as a devout Catholic, that they'll do better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are five legal challenges already to one of the other immigration actions, the order on birthright citizenship.",
      "A federal judge, appointed by Ronald Reagan, who I think you'd agree has some conservative credentials\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 paused the order to end birthright citizenship, calling it blatantly unconstitutional.",
      "How do you reconcile this challenge to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: So, I obviously disagree with that judge.",
      "And these things, some of them will be litigated. That's the nature of our constitutional system. But here's the basic idea of President Trump's view on this. If you are a lawful permanent resident or a legal immigrant who plans to stay, your children, of course, should become American citizens.",
      "But let's say you're the child of an ambassador. You don't become\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not part of it.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, that's an important principle.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's already a carve-out having to do with kids of diplomats.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: But we're saying that that carve-out should apply to anybody who doesn't plan to stay here.",
      "If you come here on vacation and you have a baby in an American hospital, that baby doesn't become an American citizen. If you're an illegal alien and you come here temporarily, hopefully, your child does not become an illegal \u2013 American citizen by virtue of just having been born on American soil.",
      "It's a very basic principle in American immigration law that, if you want to become an American citizen, and you've done it the right way, and the American people in their collective wisdom have welcomed you into our national community, then you become a citizen.",
      "But temporary residents, people who come in here, whether legally or illegally, and don't plan to stay\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 their children shouldn't become American citizens. I don't know any country that does that, or why we would be different.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but this is a country founded by immigrants.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, this is a country founded by\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a unique country.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: This is a very unique country, and it was founded by some immigrants and some settlers.",
      "But just because we were founded by immigrants doesn't mean that, 240 years later, that we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world. No country says that temporary visitors, their children will be given complete access to the benefits and blessings of American citizenship.",
      "America should actually look out for the interests of our citizens first, and that means, again, if you're here permanently and lawfully, your kid becomes an American citizen. If you're not here permanently, if you're not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 and don't plan to be, why would we make those people's children American citizens permanently?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about refugee admissions, which were just suspended by the president.",
      "That has nothing to do with the U.S. border. Refugee screening takes 18 to 24 months to go through. They are heavily vetted. Left literally at the airport this week were thousands of Afghans who \u2013 some of whom had worked with the United States government and were promised to come here.",
      "When you talked to us in August, you said: \"I don't think we should abandon anybody who's been properly vetted and helped us.\"",
      "Do you stand by that?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, Margaret, I don't agree that all these immigrants, or all these refugees have been properly vetted. In fact, we know that there are cases of people who allegedly were properly vetted and then were literally planning terrorist attacks in our country.",
      "That happened during the campaign, if you may remember. So, clearly, not all of these foreign nationals have been properly vetted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but there are 30,000 people in the pipeline, Afghan refugees. Do you stand by it?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: But my primary concern as the vice president, Margaret, is to look after the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: And now that we know that we have vetting problems with a lot of these refugee programs, we absolutely cannot unleash thousands of unvetted people into our country. It's not good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These people are vetted. These people are vetted.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Just like the guy who planned a terrorist attack in Oklahoma a few months ago? He was allegedly properly vetted, and many people in the media and the Democratic Party said that he was properly vetted. Clearly, he wasn't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I don't want my children to share a neighborhood with people who are not properly vetted. And because I don't want it for my kids, I'm not going to force any other American citizens' kids to do that either.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And that was a very particular case. It wasn't clear if he was radicalized when he got here or while he was living here, but\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I don't really care, Margaret. I don't want that person in my country, and I think most Americans agree with me.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back in one minute with more of our interview with Vice President Vance.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with more from our conversation with the vice president.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two weeks ago, you were on FOX News, and you said: \"If you protested peacefully on January 6 and had Merrick Garland's Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned. If you committed violence on that day, obviously, you shouldn't be pardoned.\"",
      "Did you counsel the president against these blanket pardons for 1,500 people\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, Margaret, I notice that you\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 including those who committed violence?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Margaret, I notice that you cut off the thing that I said immediately after that.",
      "The full quote is that, of course, there are gray areas. And here's the nature of the gray area. Merrick Garland's Department of Justice denied constitutional protections in the prosecutions. There were double standards in how sentences were applied to the J6 protesters versus other groups. What the president said consistently on the campaign\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Case-by-case basis.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 is that he was going to look at a case-by- case basis\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is blanket.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: And that's exactly what we did. We looked at 1,600 cases.",
      "And the thing that came out of it, Margaret, is that there was a massive denial of due process of liberty, and a lot of people were denied their constitutional rights. The president believes that. I believe that, and I think he made the right decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Daniel Rodriguez used an electroshock weapon against a policeman who was dragged out of the defensive line by plunging it into the officer's neck. He was imprisoned, sentenced to 12 years, seven months. He got a pardon.",
      "Ronald McAbee hit a cop while wearing reinforced brass-knuckle gloves, and he held one down on the ground as other rioters assailed the officer for over 20 seconds, causing a concussion.",
      "If you stand with law enforcement, how can you call these people unjustly imprisoned?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Margaret, you're separating \u2013 there's an important issue here.",
      "There's what the people actually did on January the 6th, and we're not saying that everybody did everything perfectly. And then what did Merrick Garland's Department of Justice do in unjustly prosecuting well over 1,000 Americans in a way that was politically motivated?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is violence like that against a police officer ever justified?",

      "But that doesn't mean that you should have Merrick Garland's weaponized Department of Justice expose you to incredibly unfair process, to denial of constitutional rights, and, frankly, to a double standard that was not applied to many people, including, of course, the Black Lives Matter rioters who killed over two dozen people and never had the weight of a weaponized Department of Justice come against them.",
      "The pardon power is not just for people who are angels or people who are perfect. And, of course, we love our law enforcement and want people to be peaceful with everybody, but especially with our good cops. That's a separate issue from what Merrick Garland's Department of Justice did. We rectified a wrong, and I stand by it.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER:: Well, this is very common that there's turnover when a new president comes in to do a review of what's happening within these agencies and in the I.G.s.",
      "I think there'll be a review as they put these individuals back, and some of the individuals will be replaced, obviously. But, you know, clearly they need to bring in their own team now. They need to look at what the performance is for these individuals. And it's very common as new administrations come in that specifically these positions be replaced.",

      "Inauguration Day, January 20th, the CEO of TikTok, whose company seemed a national security threat was U.S. law, was seated next to Tulsi Gabbard, the pick to run the intelligence community. Despite this national security law. You can see the picture of them right there.",
      "And Mr. Trump seems to have given them a reprieve. The editorial board of \"The Wall Street Journal\" said, \"Mr. Trump's TikTok order shows a Biden- like disdain for limits on his power.\"",
      "What do you make of this decision not to implement the law for at least a period of time?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-OH): Well, let's be clear, TikTok is absolutely a national security threat. The law passed by Congress, that came out of the House China Select Committee that was chaired by Michael Gallagher, that drafted this law, found that TikTok was a national security risk because of two things, its access to data and its ability to use itself as a propaganda tool by China itself, and the laws in China that allowed China to compel TikTok to manipulate itself, both its data and its access to China and its use of propaganda.",
      "The Supreme Court upheld this. It remains a national security threat. And because of that, the United States Congress, the law - that is the law of the land says that ByteDance need to divest itself.",
      "Now, the only thing that would protect the United States, and protect our citizens, is divestiture.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Maning, sell it.",

      "Now, Elon Musk has said something very interesting. He has said, you know, of course he's noted that Twitter, his X, does not have access to China. And that's sort of an admission by China as to what they're doing with TikTok. They won't let Twitter or X in, almost an admission as to what they're doing.",
      "Also, you know, ByteDance have said, well, we don't sell it. Another admission that it's really not a business. This is a propaganda tool. It is an access to data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Donald Trump's not convinced of that, because he issued an executive order saying he'll figure out a deal.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, he has said - and we certainly hope that - that he gets a deal that recognizes the issue of national security, because there is no role -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there was over 200 days to come to that deal and -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: There is - there is no role in which -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not selling.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: There is - there is no role. That's what they've said, there is no role in which they can remain active in which China can have access to this data.",
      "Let me give you just two examples. And, by the way, I commend to people the - the Supreme Court decision because it lays out in incredible detail the national security threat. If there aren't - fi the data - if the app is on your phone, they have access to the data on your phone. And, you know, President Trump -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Outside of that app?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Outside of that app. And even the - the threat is to access that your phone has to other app and other datas. And that's why governments have prohibited the app being on government phones, U.S., U.K. And India has banned the - the whole app in its - in its country.",
      "And then, of course, there's the propaganda aspect of how this can be manipulated. Romania just set aside its entire presidential election because of concerns that TikTok has manipulated data and propaganda with respect to its presidential election. Grave concerns as to what can be done with this - with TikTok.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about what's happening on Capitol Hill. You've been on this program many times as chair of the House Intelligence Committee. Speaker Johnson ousted you from that position as chair recently. What can you share about - with us about the conversation you had and the explanation? Because you've run it in a bipartisan way.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes. And I think, you know, I think certainly bipartisanship is incredibly important. And after I had the conversation with the speaker, you and I - you and I spoke.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: The speaker related, you know, certainly as we, discussed, that, you know, an element included concerns from Mar-a-Lago. He's sense walked that back. President Trump's staff has been in touch with me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he flatly denied it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: President Trump's staff has been in touch with me and said that that was not the case. The one thing that he has said is that he wanted to take the committee in a different direction.",
      "I'm a little concerned because his different direction indicates, you know, pursuing the elusive deep state. And, you know, my concern is, the focus should be on the committee of national security, which has what my focus has been. And, you know, state actors, non-state actors, those individuals who want to do our country harm. There certainly are - are bad actors and people that we need to pursue. And we certainly have done so. We find that there are laws that - that need to be changed to pursue people, to criminalize bad actions. And we certainly have done that.",
      "But there are people every day who get up in the intelligence community, who work hard to make certain that China, Russia, North Korea and Iran are prevented from doing Americans harm. And we need to focus on how we can work together to make certain we protect our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because protecting the safety of Americans is a fundamental responsibility. But just to button one thing up, when you say the White House and Mar-a-Lago said that's not the case, they didn't ask for you to be replaced -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Correct. That's what -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you saying the speaker lied?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I - you know, I - I am - the speaker and I have, you know, a good relationship. The speaker has, at this point, appointed me to lead the - the NATO Parliamentary Assembly on behalf of the House. I remain on the Armed Services Committee. I'm going to remain in - with a strong role in national security. And I'm going to continue to focus on national security and on protecting the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The new chair had voted against Ukraine aid. When you say the mission is pursuing the elusive deep state, what does that mean, weaponizing the committee?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Going after the intelligence committee?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I - I know that that's going to be a concern. We'll have to see what direction they go. I - I do know that national security is going to continue to be an area of concern. It certainly was my focus.",

      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW (D-CO): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is so much news this week. And I want to just pick up, though, on the conversation about January 6th that we had with the vice president.",
      "You've spoken about your experiences that day in very, very vivid terms. You talked about helping other lawmakers shelter. They were fearing for their lives. To help them put on gas masks. There's a picture of you that day even fighting your way out of the chamber since you had combat experience.",
      "What's your response to the vice president's defense of pardoning some of these violent offenders?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, I don't want to hear Donald Trump or J.D. Vance or anyone else in this administration talk about backing the blue, talk about supporting law enforcement when they just released over 1,000 cop beaters, people who brutally beat our law enforcement.",
      "I was there. I saw it firsthand. America saw it firsthand. The video is available for anybody to view. The brutality, the injuries. Over 150 of these officers still have injuries, several of whom lost their lives because of the injuries and trauma incurred on that day. We even had the Fraternal Order of Police come out and issue a statement condemning the pardons.",
      "So, clearly, they're not interested in supporting law enforcement. This was a political decision and a really repugnant one at that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you more about that, but I have to address the elephant in the room too because Monday, hours before leaving office, Joe Biden, then still president, preemptively pardoned his own siblings and their spouses, even though they have not been charged with any crimes. Senator Tim Kaine said, \"the decision makes it harder for Democrats to stan on the high ground and make a critique of the Trump pardons.\"",
      "Do you agree it muddies moral clarity?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: No. What I think happens here is that it shows very clearly the decision of an outgoing president to try to protect his family when you have an incoming president, and those around him who are repeatedly threatening his family, right? That is the story here, that you have Donald Trump, who has doubled down, who has tripled down on threats against Joe Biden, on threats against outgoing administration officials, simply for doing their job in many cases. This is a president, President Trump, who continues to threaten political opponents and is making every move right now in the early days of his administration to try to put in motion things to go after and to use the force of government now to go after his political opponents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you on concerns about retribution. You were plain spoken when Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter, who had been convicted of multiple crimes. And, in fact, you said in very clear terms, you thought that it did create problems for Democrats.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, in that instance I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You see a difference?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You know, I thought that there was a conflict of interest that undermined the integrity of the process. And what I would like to see overall is pardon reform. Very clearly, there needs to be some guardrails put in place and some reform of the pardon process. And I think most Americans would agree with this, to make sure that it's not misused. Because a lot of this is about the perception of America. You know, people need to know that the person sitting in the Oval Office has their best interests in mind at all times. And certainly not with Donald Trump right now can they have that feeling of trust and confidence because in five days into this administration the abuse is already rampant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You - to go back to January 6th, because there are comparisons being made. And I hear your point on pardon reform, which is basically saying presidents need guardrails on this stuff, even if they're Democrats.",
      "But one of the people pardoned by Donald Trump was Stewart Rhodes. He was released from an 18-year prison sentence for conspiring to violently stop Congress' role in the transfer of power.",
      "He was at the Capitol this Wednesday after receiving a pardon. This is a man who was recorded having said in 2021 that he wished he had brought rifles on January 6th and he spoke about hanging Nancy Pelosi.",
      "How do you make sense of that? How do lawmakers make sense of that? And are you concerned about political violence, not specifically necessarily just to him, but - but that this encourages more of that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, well, I'm sitting here last week in my office on Capitol Hill, and I turn on the TV and I see that a couple of floors below me Stewart Rhodes, as you mentioned, one of the heads of an armed militia group in America, is having coffee at the Dunkin' Donuts in the basement of my office building. So, of course, I felt uncomfortable about that, as did most of my colleagues.",
      "And I'm very focused on public safety. I always have been in this job. And you just cannot tell me that releasing militia leaders, insurrectionists, criminals back onto the street because it's what you did to placate your political base is making us any more safe, right? In an era of political violence, of extremist, where threats against members of Congress have quadrupled in the last couple of years, none of this is making us safe. It's actually creating an environment that gives permission to extremists to be more bold, to assert themselves. And we're going to see more of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to switch to what's happening in Colorado. Aurora, Colorado, is in your district. That is a location that president and candidate Trump talked quite a lot about, specifically as an example of immigration run amuck. He talks about the migrant Venezuelan gang, TDA, taking over parts of your city. Something local officials have pushed back on certainly. They were designated as a terrorist group by President Trump. Or he started the process to designate them.",
      "What does that do for the people of Aurora?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Wel, you know, I've pushed back pretty fiercely on Donald Trump's lies because this is my hometown. I live there. And I can tell you that Aurora, Colorado, is a place of great pride and great strength. We are a community of immigrants and refugees. Nearly 20 percent of my constituents were born outside of the United States. These are our business owners. These are our friends. They go to school with my children. They work in our community. They grow businesses in our community.",
      "And the rhetoric of Donald Trump, both on the campaign trail and now, demonizing these folks and telling gross lies and exaggerations is not only - not only impugns the reputation of a strong and vibrant community -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: But it makes those folks less safe. And I will stand up over and over again and push back against those lies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: At the same time it does nothing to advance the cause of comprehensive immigration reform, which we desperately need, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Anybody knows that our system is badly broken. And Donald Trump is not making the moves to fix it.",

      "Cartels - returning to the subject of immigration, we're joined now by CBS immigration and politics reporter, Camilo Montoya-Galvez, who is arguably the busiest person in the entire CBS bureau right now.",
      "Camilo, I want to have you bottom line some things.",
      "I understand you have new reporting about some of the plans for migrants being deported.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. We can report that the Trump administration is currently working on striking an asylum agreement with the country of El Salvador to deport migrants from different countries across Latin America to the small country in Central America. This would be a so-called safe third country asylum agreement that would empower U.S. immigration officials, Margaret, to deport non-Salvadoran migrants to El Salvador with instructions to seek asylum there and not in the U.S.",
      "Importantly, I am told that one plan under consideration would allow the U.S. to deport Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador and have that country house them or detain them. And that would, obviously, be a significant development and break through potentially for the administration because, as you know, Venezuela, right now, currently does not accept U.S. deportations. And so, the administration is moving aggressively and quickly to really oversee a sweeping crackdown on immigration. We have seen the president invoke sweeping constitutional powers to essentially shut down the asylum system at the border. And he is also enlisting the vast resources of the military to really enhance immigration enforcement, not only deploying more troops, but using military planes to deport migrants.",
      "And, yes, there have been so far 1,500 troops deployed to the border. But one internal Customs and Border Protection memo we obtain, Margaret, shows that that number could rise to as many as 10,000 active duty troops.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's so much that you just laid out there. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to go to El Salvador in the coming days.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I imagine it's related to the news you just broke here.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And - and TDA is the gang we were just talking about with the congressman as well.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of how the U.S. military is being used, President Biden left 2,500 U.S. troops at the border.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what's actually different now that there's an extra 1,500?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Well, the work is not changing. What is changing is the number of troops on the ground. They are still assigned to do logistical and operational work and to assist Customs and Border Protection in an operational capacity by, for example, setting up border barriers to repel migrants from entering the country illegally and providing surveillance. They are not to be used to arrest or otherwise process migrants because, as you know, longstanding federal law prohibits the use of the military for civilian law enforcement. And that would include the enforcement of federal immigration laws.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it's the optics essentially that this is -",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: It's a show of force by the Biden -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a show of force?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: By the Trump administration, rather.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And what, in terms of the changes have occurred in terms of use of military? We were hearing about lots of deportations. Now it seems we're getting reports daily of military planes carrying migrants to Guatemala.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: An attempt, apparently, to Columbia as well.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. So, the administration has already used military planes to deport migrants to the country of Guatemala. And, overnight, it attempted to send two military aircraft to Columbia, sending about 160 deportees from that country to Bogota, Columbia, the capital. But we are told now that the president of Columbia, Gustavo Petro, objected to the use of military planes and blocked those deportations. So, this shows that the administration will still face significant diplomatic challenges as it tries to oversee this aggressive immigration plan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden team was deporting to those countries. They were using civilian aircraft.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: ICE charter flights, correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the military planes were the problem there?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: And, again, it's a show of force by the Trump administration.",

      "JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): Every morning, Capitol Police officers make good on their pledge to ensure that lawmakers, citizens and the press can move safely through the Capitol. They protect an idea that in that building passionate disputes can find peaceful resolution. Each day their willingness to sacrifice honors this American system, whether violence comes or not.",
      "On January 6, 2021, violence came, and they answered their oath's call. Heroes emerged. The lawmakers they protected praised their bravery.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-TX): Law enforcement went in, Capitol Police and Secret Service, they bravely confronted the terrorists. They bravely removed them. They secured the Capitol.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): One hundred and forty officers were injured, some sustained brain injuries, cracked ribs and even shattered spinal discs. In the following days, one officer, Brian Sicknick, would die from his physical wounds, while four others would take their own lives. A plaque was commissioned to honor them. Plaques are made of metal because they are meant to be as durable as the message, do not forget. A plaque transforms courage and sacrifice of an instant into lessons for the future in case lawmakers lose their way.",
      "The symbols of Inauguration Day do that, too. The Rotunda painting of General Washington giving up power, Lincoln's Bible, acts of heroism in service of democratic ideals, nourishment from the past to the present. All serve one idea, that the voice of the people is honored through a peaceful transfer of power. On Inauguration Day, both parties applauded this.",
      "Law enforcement stood guard over the peaceful transition, but the shared commitment to what they protected proved more fragile than their watch. By sundown, the president, sanctified by those symbols, and now the steward of the ideas they represent, pardoned the 1,500 rioters who had sought to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power on January 6th and overturn the vote of 81 million Americans. Among those whose crimes were erased, those who had pierced, electrocuted and smashed police officers. The lawmakers the officers had protected offered no defense.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Good morning. Good to have you here.",
      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot to get to with you. I want to ask you about this breaking news that President Trump fired 15 inspectors general. Those are the federal watchdogs who monitor for waste, fraud and abuse. He didn't give 30 days' notice, as legally required. Does this concern you that these agencies can't police themselves?",
      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Well, this is very common that there's turnover when a new president comes in to do a review of what's happening within these agencies and in the IGs. I think there'll be a review as they put these individuals back, and some of the individuals will be replaced, obviously. But you know, clearly they need to bring in their own team now. They need to look at what the performance is for these individuals. And it's very common as new administrations come in that specifically these positions be replaced.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're not concerned these are just going to be loyalists?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, every administration replaces them, so in the- in the end, they tend to be, I mean, what I have seen, and I think what we have seen throughout the- all administrations of these tend to be incredibly professional individuals that really are great watchdogs. And I think we'll see that from this administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What should happen now that the CIA has released this low-confidence assessment that it was most likely a lab leak, a research experiment versus naturally occurring virus that resulted in the COVID pandemic?",
      "REP. TURNER: The Biden administration really has been an impediment to getting to the answer here. Congress passed--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --This is their finding--",
      "REP. TURNER: --Right, but Congress passed, and the Biden administration signed an order declassifying the information concerning the lab leak theory and the issues with respect to COVID origins. And the administration still refused to release it. I think this is a great start, and really it's been unfortunate that the administration has been slow. This is a good turning point, because clearly this was not of natural origins.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have more to talk about on the China front, on the other side of this break. So, stay with us, and we hope all of you will as well. We'll be right back.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation now with Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Just to pick up on the topic of- of China, we've been talking about TikTok. The law stated that January 19, and the Supreme Court upheld this, that the owner ByteDance would have to sell TikTok to an American owner. Inauguration day, January 20, the CEO of Tiktok, whose company is deemed a national security threat under US law, was seated next to Tulsi Gabbard, the pick to run the intelligence community. Despite this national security law. You can see the picture of them right there, and Mr. Trump seems to have given them a reprieve. The editorial board of the Wall Street Journal said \"Mr. Trump's Tiktok order shows a Biden-like disdain for limits on his power.\" What do you make of this decision not to implement the law for at least a period of time?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, let's be clear. TikTok is absolutely a national security threat. The law passed by Congress that came out of the House China Select Committee, that was chaired by Mike Gallagher, that drafted this law, found that TikTok was a national security risk because of two things, its access to data and its ability to use itself as a propaganda tool by China itself and the laws in China that allowed China to compel Tiktok to manipulate itself, both its data and its access to China and its use of propaganda. The Supreme Court upheld this, it remains a national security threat, and because of that, the United States Congress, the law that is the law of the land, says that ByteDance needs to divest itself. Now, the only thing that would protect the United States and protect our citizens is divestiture.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Meaning selling--",
      "REP. TURNER: And that means that ByteDance needs to divest itself. Now, Elon Musk has said something very interesting. He said, you know- of course- he's noted that Twitter, his X, does not have access to China, and that's sort of an admission by China as to what they're doing with TikTok. They won't let Twitter or X in, almost an admission as to what they're doing. Also, ByteDance have said, well, we won't sell it, another admission that it's really not a business. This is a propaganda tool, it is access to data--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Donald Trump's not convinced of that, because he issued an executive order saying he'll figure out a deal.",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, he has said- and we certainly hope that he gets a deal that recognizes the issue of national security, because there--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But they had more than 200 days to come to that deal--",
      "REP. TURNER:\u00a0 -- There is no role to--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And they're not selling--",
      "REP. TURNER: -- There is- there is- that's what they've said. There is no role in which they can remain active, in which China can have access to this data. Let me give you just two examples. And by the way, I commend to people the- the Supreme Court decision, because it lays out in incredible detail the national security threat. If there- are if the data- if the app is on your phone, they have access to the data on your phone and President Trump--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- outside of that app?",
      "REP. TURNER: -- Outside of that app. And even the- the threat is to the access that your phone has to other app and other datas, and that's why governments have prohibited the app being on government phones, US, UK. And India has banned the- the whole app in its- in its country. And then, of course, there's the propaganda aspect of how this can be manipulated. Romania just set aside its entire presidential election because of concerns that Tiktok has manipulated data and propaganda with respect to its presidential election. Grave concerns as to what can be done with this, with- with Tiktok.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you as well about what's happening on Capitol Hill. You've been on this program many times as chair of the House Intelligence Committee. Speaker Johnson ousted you from that position as chair recently. What can you share about- with us about the conversation you had and the explanation, because you run it in a bipartisan way?",
      "REP. TURNER: Yes, and I think, you know, I think certainly, bipartisanship is incredibly important. And after I had the conversation with the Speaker, you and I- you and I spoke. The- the speaker related, you know, certainly, as we discussed that, you know, an element included concerns from Mar-a-Lago. He's since walked that back. President Trump's staff has been in touch with me--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well he flatly denied it--",
      "REP. TURNER: -- President Trump's staff has been in touch with me and said that that was not the case. The one thing that he has said is that he wanted to take the committee in a different direction. I'm a little concerned, because his different direction indicates pursuing the elusive Deep State. And my concern is the focus should be on the committee of national security, which is what my focus has been on state actors, non-state actors, those individuals who want to do our country harm. There certainly are bad actors and people that we need to pursue, and we certainly have done so where we find that there are laws that- that -that need to be changed to pursue people, to criminalize bad actions, and we certainly have done that. But there are people every day who get up in the intelligence community who work hard to make certain that China, Russia, North Korea and Iran are prevented from doing Americans harm, and we need to focus on how we can work together to make certain we protect our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because protecting the safety of Americans is a fundamental responsibility. But just to button one thing up, when you say the White House and Mar a Lago said that's not the case. They didn't ask for you to be replaced.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you saying the speaker lied?",
      "REP. TURNER: I'm not- I'm not- I'm not going to say that. I have- the Speaker and I have, you know- a good relationship to the Speaker, has at this point appointed me to lead the NATO Parliamentary Assembly on behalf of the House. I remain on the Armed Services Committee. I'm going to remain in- with a strong role in national security, and I'm going to continue to focus on national security and on protecting the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The new chair has voted against Ukraine aid. When you say the mission is pursuing the elusive deep state, what does that mean? Weaponizing the committee?",
      "REP. TURNER: I- I- we'll have to see as to what direction they go. I know that that's a concern\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Going after the Intelligence community?",
      "REP. TURNER: I know that that's going to be a concern. We'll have to see what direction they go. I do know that national security is going to continue to be an area of concern. It certainly was my focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you- so you are concerned that the oversight in the congressional branch of the intelligence community will not happen and will instead be focused in a politicized way? Is that what I hear you saying?",
      "REP. TURNER: I know that my focus was national security, and that's going to continue to be my focus in Congress--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Very quickly--",
      "REP. TURNER: --and we'll have to- and we'll have to stay tuned for the rest.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very diplomatic. Before I let you go, Donald Trump pulled security details from those who face active threats from Iran, including former CIA Director and Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. Would you ask him to reconsider that?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, obviously, I'm very concerned for Mike Pompeo.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright. Mike Turner, thank you for your time. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. JASON CROW: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is so much news this week, and I want to just pick up, though, on the conversation about January 6 that we had with the vice president. You've spoken about your experiences that day in very, very vivid terms. You talked about helping other lawmakers shelter. They were fearing for their lives. To help them put on gas masks. There's a picture of you that day, even fighting your way out of the chamber, since you had combat experience. What's your response to the vice president's defense of- of pardoning some of these violent offenders?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, I don't want to hear Donald Trump, or JD Vance, or anyone else in this administration talk about backing the blue, talk about supporting law enforcement, when they just released over 1000 cop beaters, people who brutally beat our law enforcement. I was there. I saw it firsthand. America saw it firsthand. The video is available for anybody to view. The- the brutality, the injuries. Over 150 of these officers still have injuries, several of whom lost their lives because of the injuries and trauma incurred on that day. We even had the Fraternal Order of Police come out and- and issue a statement condemning the- the pardons. So clearly, they're not interested in supporting law enforcement. This was a political decision and- and a really repugnant one at that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you more about that, but I have to address the elephant in the room too, because Monday, hours before leaving office, Joe Biden, then still president, preemptively pardoned his own siblings and their spouses, even though they have not been charged with any crimes. Senator Tim Kaine said the decision makes it harder for Democrats to \"stand on the high ground and make a critique of the Trump pardons.\" Do you agree it muddies moral clarity?",
      "REP. CROW: No. What I think happens here is that it- it shows very clearly the decision of an outgoing president to try to protect his family when you have an in- incoming president, and those around him, who are repeatedly threatening his family, right? That- that is the story here, that you have Donald Trump, who has doubled down, who has tripled down, on threats against Joe Biden, on threats against outgoing administration officials, simply for doing their job in many cases. This is a president, President Trump, who continues to threaten political opponents and is making every move right now in the early days of his- of his administration, to try to put in motion things to go after and to use the force of government now to go after his political opponents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you on concerns about retribution, but you were plain spoken when Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter, who had been convicted of multiple crimes. And in fact, you said in very clear terms you- you thought that it did create problems for Democrats.",
      "REP. CROW: Yeah, in that instance, I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You see a difference.",
      "REP. CROW: You know, I thought that there was a conflict of interest that undermined the integrity of the process. And what I would like to see overall is pardon reform. Very clearly, there needs to be some guardrails put in place and some reform of the pardon process, and I think most Americans would agree with this, to make sure that it's not misused, because a lot of this is about the perception of America. People need to know that the person sitting in the Oval Office has their best interests in mind at all times, and certainly not with Donald Trump right now, can- can they have that feeling of trust and confidence, because in- five days into this administration, the abuse is already rampant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You- to go back to January 6, because there are comparisons being made. And- and I hear your point on pardon reform, which is basically saying presidents need guardrails on this stuff, even if they're Democrats, but one of the people pardoned by Donald Trump was Stewart Rhodes. He was released from an 18 year prison sentence for conspiring to violently stop Congress's role in the transfer of power. He was at the capitol this Wednesday after receiving a pardon. This is a man who was recorded having said in 2021 that he wished he had brought rifles on January 6, and he spoke about hanging Nancy Pelosi. How do you make sense of that? How do lawmakers make sense of that? And are you concerned about political violence? Not specific, necessarily, just to him, but- but that this encourages more of that?",
      "REP. CROW: Yeah. Well, I'm sitting here last week in my office on Capitol Hill, and I turn on the TV and I see that a couple of floors below me, Stewart Rhodes, as you mentioned, one of the heads of a- an armed militia group in America, is having coffee at the Dunkin' Donuts in the basement of my office building. So of course, I felt uncomfortable about that, as did most of my colleagues, and I'm- I'm very focused on public safety. I always have been in this job. And you just cannot tell me that releasing militia leaders, insurrectionists, criminals, back onto the street because it's what you did to placate your political base, is making us any more safe, right? In an era of political violence, of extremism, where threats against members of Congress have quadrupled in the last couple of years. None of this is making us safe. It's actually creating an environment that gives permission to extremists to be more bold, to assert themselves. And we're going to see more of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to switch to what's happening in Colorado. Aurora, Colorado is in your district. That is a location that President and candidate Trump talked quite a lot about, specifically as an example of immigration run amok. He- he talks about this migrant Venezuelan gang, TdA, taking over parts of your city, something local officials have pushed back on, certainly. They were designated as a terrorist group by President Trump, or he started the process to designate them. What does that do for the people of Aurora?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, you know, I pushed back pretty fiercely on Donald Trump's lies, because this is my hometown. I live there, and I can tell you that Aurora, Colorado is a place of great pride and great strength. We are a community of immigrants and refugees. Nearly 20% of my constituents were born outside of the United States. These are our business owners. These are our friends. They go to school with my children. They work in our community. They grow businesses in our community. And the rhetoric of Donald Trump, both on the campaign trail and now, demonizing these folks and telling gross lies and exaggerations is not only- not only impugns the reputation of a strong and vibrant community, but it makes those folks less safe. And- and I will stand up over and over again and push back against those lies. At the same time, it does nothing to advance the cause of comprehensive immigration reform, which we desperately need--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, well--",
      "REP. CROW: --right? Anybody knows that our system is badly broken and Donald Trump is not making the move to fix it.",

      "\"America should actually look out for the interests of our citizens first,\" Vance said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"If you're here permanently and lawfully, your kid becomes an American citizen.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order targeting birthright citizenship directs federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents to children born on U.S. soil to parents in the country illegally or under temporary visas, and came among a wave of executive actions he signed shortly after returning to office last week.",
      "The U.S. government has long interpreted the Constitution to mean that those born on American soil are citizens at birth, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution says \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "But Trump has for years touted the idea of ending birthright citizenship, arguing that it encourages illegal immigration.",

      "Vance said he disagrees, noting that the issue will be litigated, which he said is \"the nature of our constitutional system.\"",
      "Vance explained that the \"basic idea\" behind the move is that lawful permanent residents or the children of a legal immigrant who plans to stay in the U.S. \"should become American citizens.\" But he said anyone who doesn't plan to stay and gives birth in the U.S. shouldn't become a citizen \"by virtue of just having been born on American soil.\"",

      "\"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\"",
      "The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said.",
      "As A23a ultimately melted it could seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",

      "Uranus and Neptune will also be there, but they won't be bright and visible without a telescope.",
      "So-called planetary parades are not super rare, according to NASA, but they don't happen every year. There was\u00a0planetary parade in June 2024 when six planets \u2014 Mercury, Jupiter, Uranus, Mars, Neptune and Saturn \u2014 all aligned.",
      "These events are often called a planetary alignment, but planets always appear in a line in the sky because they orbit the sun \u2014 the difference is that they will appear closer to each other and Earth, making them visible from our planet.",
      "Saturn and Venus will be making a close approach in January. Their closest approach to each other occurred on Jan. 17 and 18.",
      "Mars and Earth will also align in their orbits, and this will occur around the time when Mars is at its closets to Earth, so it will appear bigger and brighter in the night sky. This is called an opposition and it happens about every two years.",
      "In February, seven planets will be in alignment \u2013 Saturn, Mercury, Neptune, Venus, Uranus, Jupiter and Mars. Most will be visible to the naked eye, but to see Uranus and Neptune, you may need a telescope or binoculars,\u00a0according to Starwalk, a sky-gazing app that tracks space events for astronomers and amateur stargazers. This alignment will be most visible worldwide on February 28.",
      "Those who want to see this event should start looking for the alignment as soon as the sun sets. Some places might have a better view of the alignment on different days. For example, in New York, you might see the event best on Feb. 25, according to Starwalk.",

    "summary": "Chinese startup DeepSeek has debuted an AI app that challenges OpenAI's ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, sending a shock through Wall Street.",
    "story": [
      "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after Mr. Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:56:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The $500 billion Stargate project is projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Here's what's known so far.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the new $500 billion Stargate AI venture from OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle on Tuesday, he promised it would ensure \"the future of technology\" in the U.S. So far, Wall Street appears to agree, with some analysts speculating about its potential to transform the tech industry.",
      "But the project is also sparking some questions and skepticism, including pointed criticism from one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\"They don't actually have the money,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media app he owns. \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\"",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman countered that claim,\u00a0replying to Musk, \"wrong, as you surely know.\"",
      "Whatever the case might be, there are plenty of questions swirling about Stargate, which takes its name from a science-fiction movie and TV show about portals that transport people to other galaxies.",
      "At a White House briefing on Tuesday for the project's announcement, the executives behind the venture described Stargate as an AI project that could also prove to be transformative, albeit via Earth-based tech rather than intergalactic travel.",
      "\"This will help people's lives. This will help solve many, many issues ... with the power of AI,\" said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who joined Mr. Trump at the briefing, along with Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.",
      "\"I think this will be the most important project of this era,\" added Altman.",
      "Here's what we know about the project so far.",
      "What is the Stargate project?",
      "Stargate is a venture that has the backing of OpenAI, Oracle and Japanese company Softbank, with the latter promising an initial investment of $100 billion, according to Tuesday's announcement.",
      "The goal, said Son, is to ramp that investment to $500 billion within 4 years, or before the end of Mr. Trump's current term.",
      "Softbank will hold financial responsibility for the project, while OpenAI will oversee the operations, according to a research note from Capital Economics chief economist John Higgins. \"Donald Trump's ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of his second presidency,\" he noted.",
      "Where will Stargate be located?",
      "Stargate investment will be directed toward constructing data centers to support AI development, according to the announcement.",
      "Already, there are data centers under construction in Texas, with the first one located in Abilene, Oracle's Ellison said at the press conference. The goal is to construct 10 data centers initially, with plans to expand to 20 locations of about half a million square feet each, he added.",
      "Other potential sites for data centers across the nation are also being evaluated, according to a person familiar with the project.",
      "What type of projects will Stargate AI pursue?",
      "The data centers will be used by OpenAI, according to the person familiar with the project.",
      "During the press conference, Ellison highlighted AI's ability to transform health care, saying that the tools provided by OpenAI and Softbank are helping to develop a cancer vaccine.",
      "\"You can do early cancer detection with a blood test, and, using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancer that is seriously threatening the person,\" Ellison said. \"Once we gene sequence that gene tumor, you can vaccinate the person against that cancer, and you can make that mRNA vaccine robotically using AI within 48 hours.\"",
      "How many jobs could Stargate create?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed the venture would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately,\" while OpenAI, in a statement on its website, says Stargate will \"create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\"",
      "New hires for the project will be situated close to the data center locations, according to the person familiar with the venture. Stargate will hire people for construction, operations and other areas, they said.",
      "What is President Trump's AI policy?",
      "Mr. Trump is signaling a sharp divergence from former President Biden's AI policy. Within hours after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing Biden's guardrails for the fast-developing technology.",
      "What will come next from Mr. Trump and how it will diverge from his predecessor's effort to safeguard AI technology remains unclear. The new administration didn't respond to requests for comment about the repealed Biden policy.",
      "Even so, Wall Street interpreted the Stargate project as a sign the Trump administration will encourage investment and growth of the AI sector, especially as a way to bolster the nation's AI capabilities as it competes with China for tech dominance.",
      "\"The key role of Softbank, a Japanese company, in Stargate, highlights how Trump isn't hell-bent on excluding foreign firms from participating in America's quest for dominance in AI \u2013 provided they are headquartered in countries that are close allies of the U.S.,\" Capital Economics' Higgins wrote.",
      "He added, \"The new president seems much less keen than his predecessor on imposing checks and balances on the spread of AI.\"",
      "Why are some skeptical about Stargate?",
      "Aside from Musk, others have raised questions about whether Stargate's investment will actually reach $500 billion, with Higgins of Capital Economics writing, \"Whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen.\"",
      "Musk also has a public feud with OpenAI and Altman, alleging in a lawsuit last year that the company and its CEO violated OpenAI's original mission statement by putting profits over benefiting humanity. After helping found OpenAI in 2015, Musk broke with the company, claiming that the AI firm had veered away from its founding agreement that it would use its technology to benefit the public and that it would open its technology for public use.",

    "summary": "Monterey County supervisors on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in response to last week's major fire at the Vistra lithium battery plant in Moss Landing.",
    "story": [
      "Monterey County supervisors on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in response to last week's major fire at the Vistra lithium battery plant in Moss Landing.",
      "The emergency declaration came during a special meeting where officials gave updates on the fire and ongoing response. While the fire has burned itself out, there are still a lot of questions from local leaders and neighbors about what's next.",
      "\"This was the beginning,\" said Josh Contreras as he showed photos he took of the incident from his houseboat.",
      "The images show a fireball on the horizon, not even a mile away.",
      "\"I walked up the docks, and then I took more photos,\" he said. \"Because you could see the flames, probably almost as tall as the towers that stand here.\"",
      "The fire at the Moss Landing Vistra Power Plant, located about 90 miles south of San Francisco,\u00a0broke out last Thursday afternoon, escalating in the early evening to the point where the incident\u00a0triggered evacuations for about 1,200 Monterey County residents\u00a0in the area and shut down a section of Highway 1 in both directions.",
      "Concerned over the potentially toxic runoff if fire crews turned hoses on the burning lithium batteries, officials instead are allowing the to burn itself out.",
      "Officials\u00a0said the fire was largely out as of late Friday morning\u00a0during a press conference, but it flared up significantly for a few hours that afternoon before dying down again. Officials were eventually able to lift the evacuation orders by early Friday evening. The stretch of Highway 1 near the plant remained closed until Sunday.",
      "Now that the fire is out, he is one of the many people living in the area what lies in the future for the facility.",
      "\"If they do battery packs, they should keep it in more deserted areas,\" Contreras said.",
      "\"This technology is ahead of the government's ability to regulate it,\" Monterey County Supervisor Glenn Church said during the emergency meeting Tuesday. \"And the industry's ability to control it.\"",
      "Supervisors were asking similar questions about the fire. A representative from Vistra said were just getting access to the burned-out lithium battery facility. The incident was enough for Church, who last week likened the fire to a \"Three Mile Island\" event for the emerging industry -- to draw this conclusion:",
      "\"Battery storage is essential for the future. And that's the direction we're going,\" Church noted. \"But -- as I said last night and I've tried to emphasize -- we just can't put that above safety. That's got to be the priority at this point.\"",
      "Church is calling for the Vistra facility to remain closed until an independent investigation can determine the cause of the incident.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we're on a pretty steep learning curve with battery safety still,\" said Dustin Mulvaney, a professor of environmental sciences at San Jose State University. \"And we're still figuring out ways that these batteries catch on fire. We're still figuring out how to best suppress them.\"",
      "Mulvaney  said the Moss Landing facility fire will be a wake-up call for the entire industry, right down to the people who insure the batteries. A lot of people will want to know what went wrong, and where, in a plant that is a hodgepodge of lithium battery technology.",
      "\"That site is actually an example of different ways to design it,\" Mulvaney explained. \"Because it was built in different phases. They took advantage of different opportunities to put things in different places. But this example will cause the industry to reflect on how they built these things. Because they have to be better neighbors to the community.\"",
      "Those who live in the community are reflecting on what it means to have this plant as a neighbor.",
      "\"Yeah. It should be out in the desert,\" said plant neighbor Julie Nieman. \"Somewhere in Nevada, out in the desert where people aren't around. Why would you put it where people live, in this beautiful area by the ocean?\"",
      "With the exception of one closed roadway beside the plant, things in Moss Landing are pretty much back to normal. The parks and beaches have to reopened, though some people have raised additional questions about the impact the fire had on the environment, particularly the sensitive Elkhorn Slough Reserve. The wetlands area is home to a number of endangered sea otters.",
      "The county says it is going to start water quality testing this week, but they say that is not as high of a concern as the air quality was during the fire.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is also issuing bans and restrictions on legal immigration, including refugees displaced by violence.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration's swift crackdown on immigration\u00a0has moved beyond those living in or entering the U.S. illegally, with officials also issuing bans and restrictions on legal immigration, including programs for refugees displaced by violence.",
      "President Trump made getting tough on illegal immigration a pillar of his presidential campaign, and he has already enacted far-reaching measures targeting those who violated U.S. immigration law. They include sealing the U.S. asylum system for those without proper documents; tasking the military\u00a0with deporting immigration violators; and empowering deportation officers to target most unauthorized immigrants, including those without criminal records.",
      "But, with less fanfare, Mr. Trump's actions have closed pathways for vetting and legally admitting hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war-torn Ukraine, Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and other troubled parts of the world, including crisis-stricken Haiti and Venezuela.",
      "Refugee admissions suspended",
      "Hours after taking office, Mr. Trump indefinitely paused the U.S. refugee admissions program, instructing officials to ban the entry of all refugees, a special legal classification for people vetted overseas who prove they are fleeing persecution based on their political beliefs, religion or other factors.",
      "Unpublished State Department statistics obtained by CBS News show the move stranded more than 22,000 refugees who had been approved for departure to the U.S. after undergoing a process that, on average, takes between 18 and 24 months due to rounds of interviews, security screenings and medical checks.",
      "As part of its suspension of foreign aid, the administration instructed the resettlement agencies that integrate refugees into American communities to stop using certain federal funds \u2014 a directive advocates believe will prevent them from providing critical services to those refugees already in the U.S.",
      "Refuge admissions will only be restarted if Mr. Trump determines that doing so \"is in the interests of the United States,\" according to his directive. In that order, he argued refugees were a strain on American communities.",
      "Immigration process for Afghans, Ukrainians and others halted",
      "The Trump administration has also directed officials to cease allowing immigrants into the U.S. through an immigration policy known as parole, which can be used to grant entry to foreigners on humanitarian or public interest grounds. The Biden administration used that law at an unprecedented scale, including to dissuade migrants from traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "An internal directive by the acting head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services last week ordered officials to stop granting parole to Ukrainians sponsored by Americans through the Uniting for Ukraine policy, which the Biden administration set up to offer a safe haven to those fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Roughly 240,000 Ukrainians came to the U.S. under the process, according to unpublished government data.",
      "It also instructed officials to refrain from renewing the parole status of Afghans brought to the U.S. following the fall of Kabul in 2021. While many of the more than 70,000 Afghan\u00a0evacuees have gained asylum or special visas for those who aided the American military, the move could prompt some to lose their legal status.",
      "The order suspended processing for other parole-based programs, including a sponsorship initiative for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans and an Obama-era policy that allowed some Central American youth to come to the country legally to reunite with relatives. Both policies were designed to be alternatives to trekking to the U.S. southern border.",
      "While those paroled into the country are, on paper, in the U.S. legally and with the ability to work lawfully, Trump administration officials have argued the Biden administration improperly used the authority, which they believe should only be used in very limited cases.",
      "Just minutes after Mr. Trump was sworn in, his administration shut down a mobile application, known as CBP One, that allowed migrants in Mexico to request a time to enter the U.S. at official border entry points. U.S. border officials were welcoming 1,500 migrants per day under that app during the Biden administration, which touted the process as the right way to seek asylum since crossing between ports of entry is illegal.",
      "Last week, Trump officials authorized Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to revoke the parole status of those allowed into the U.S. under the Biden administration and seek their deportation. That would include more than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who flew to the U.S. under the sponsor policy and nearly 1 million migrants allowed into the country through CBP One, government figures show.",
      "Other actions targeting legal migration channels",
      "Trump officials moved quickly to cease operations at offices that the Biden administration established in four Latin American countries to vet and screen migrants for legal immigration programs and discourage them from unlawfully crossing the southern border. Those hubs, known as \"Safe Mobility Offices,\" also vetted migrants for resettlement in Spain and Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump's move to upend birthright citizenship \u2014 for now, halted in the courts \u2014 would deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to immigrants on temporary visas (as well as to those with parents who are in the country illegally).",
      "Other restrictions on legal immigration are also expected further into Mr. Trump's term. He already tasked federal agencies to recommend partial or total immigration bans for countries whose citizens officials determine cannot be properly vetted.",
      "Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, a refugee resettlement group, said she appreciated some of the comments Mr. Trump has made in support of legal immigration. But she said she was deeply troubled by his move to halt refugee arrivals.",
      "\"Canceling flights for already approved refugees who have waited years as they've gone through extreme vetting betrays promises we made in creating this bipartisan legal program,\" Vignarajah said, calling the refugee process the \"gold standard\" in legal immigration.",
      "Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for cutting legal immigration, said Mr. Trump is cracking down on immigration programs he believes former President Biden \"unlawfully created or unlawfully abused.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 11:03:09 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has painted a bullseye on diversity, equity and inclusion. But what exactly is DEI, and what has it achieved?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government is renewing debate over what DEI is and whether it has benefited workers and companies.",
      "DEI has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion and other criteria. In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity.",
      "This push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0order, issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as \"illegal and immoral,\" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave.",
      "What is DEI in the workplace?",
      "DEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation.",
      "Many critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism.",
      "But DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees.",
      "\"DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'\" David Glasglow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool.\"",
      "In defining DEI, Glasglow described \"diversity\" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. \"It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status.",
      "\"These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,\" she explained.",
      "The equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work.",
      "\"It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,\" Fulton said. \"It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive.\"",
      "Corporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton.",
      "\"It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,\" Fulton said.",
      "Given the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford,\u00a0Harley Davidson,\u00a0McDonald's, Meta and more.",
      "How is success measured?",
      "Many corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues.",
      "Glasglow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. \"It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,\" he said. \"It also depends on what you are trying to achieve.\"",
      "One tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired \u2014 patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness.",
      "By contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool.",
      "Corporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line.",
      "\"The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,\" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry.\"",
      "In one noted study, McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research, the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management \u2014 women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015.",

      "A memo from the White House budget office is calling for a spending freeze on federal assistance by 5 p.m. Tuesday, which could affect everything from aid to nonprofits, universities, small business loans and state and local government grants.",
      "The freeze could have wide-ranging implications, with the White House noting that $3 trillion was spent in 2024 on federal assistance programs.",
      "\"This memorandum requires Federal agencies to identify and review all Federal financial assistance programs and supporting activities consistent with the President's policies and requirements,\" the memo says.",

      "The Monday night memo from the Office of Management and Budget is directing federal agencies to assess compliance with President Trump's executive orders \u2014 specifically targeting \"DEI, woke gender ideology and the Green New Deal.\" It does not give specifics on what these policies refer to, especially since the Green New Deal was never signed into law.",
      "\"The use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,\" the memo says.",
      "The White House memo said it will not affect Medicare or Social Security benefits.",
      "Democrats were already on the offensive on Tuesday morning. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer strongly condemned the move at a news conference, saying \"in an an instant, Donald Trump has shut off billions, perhaps trillions, of dollars, that directly support states, cities, towns, schools, hospitals, small businesses, and most of all, families.\"",
      "\"This is a dagger at the heart of the average American family,\" Schumer said, adding that he and his Democratic colleagues are receiving a \"deluge\" of calls to their offices from people panicked over what the memo means for them.",
      "\"This decision is lawless, dangerous, destructive, cruel. It's illegal, it's unconstitutional,\" Schumer said. \"Plain and simple, this is Project 2025.\"",
      "Diane Yentel, the president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, issued a statement on social media calling the order a \"potential 5-alarm fire for nonprofits.\"",
      "\"From pausing research on cures for childhood cancer to closing homeless shelters, halting food assistance, reducing safety from domestic violence, and shutting down suicide hotlines, the impact of even a short pause in funding could be devastating and cost lives,\" Yentel said. \"This order could decimate thousands of organizations and leave neighbors without the services they need.\"",
      "The memo is likely to prompt legal challenges from entities who were set to receive the now-frozen funds, and they could come quickly. Orders from lower courts directing agencies to turn the spigot back on while legal proceedings continue could eventually lead the Justice Department to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "Critics of the most recent action from the Trump administration have argued that the budget office's move to temporarily withhold federal funds violates the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that lays out the framework for the president's ability to freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress.",
      "But Russ Vought, Mr. Trump's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, told the Senate panel holding his confirmation hearing last week that the president believes the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional, and said he agrees with that assessment.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democratic appropriator, said she's urging Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican appropriator, to hold Vought's nomination for OMB director, while calling the memo a \"brazen and illegal move\" with an \"unprecedented\" scope.",

      "Duffy, 53, represented Wisconsin in the Senate from 2011 to 2019 and previously served as the district attorney of Ashland County, Wisconsin. He joined Fox News as a contributor and co-hosted a show on Fox Business after leaving Congress, until President Trump announced his selection for transportation secretary. He and his wife, whom he met on a reality television show, have nine children.",
      "The Senate voted unanimously to advance Duffy Monday night, after he appeared before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee earlier this month. At the hearing, he was introduced by the two Wisconsin senators \u2014 Republican Ron Johnson and Democrat Tammy Baldwin.",

      "\"President Trump, he's a builder. He wants to invest in rebuilding our nation's crumbling infrastructure,\" Duffy said, adding that Trump asked him to focus on the \"big, the durable projects that connect our country and connect our people.\"",
      "Duffy said he would work to reduce red tape that slows critical infrastructure projects. And he pledged to prioritize road safety and keep safety as a top priority in aviation.

      "The president also signed an executive order directing the Pentagon to determine a policy for transgender service members based on readiness within 30 days.

      "Speaking about his plans at a retreat with House Republicans Monday at his property in Doral, Florida, Mr. Trump said, \"To ensure we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It's going to be gone.\"",

The article contained numerous scientific and factual errors and was eventually retracted. Decades of research has established there is no such link.",

      "Employees at the Philadelphia store at 21st Street and Pennsylvania Avenue cast 130 votes \u2014 or about 57% of the ballots cast \u2014 in favor of joining a local chapter of The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union for the purposes of collective bargaining. According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",
      "\"This fight is far from over, but today's victory is an important step forward,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of UFCW Local 1776. \"We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers' needs and priorities.\"",
      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon's grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",
      "In a statement after the votes were counted Monday night, Whole Foods said it \"is proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.\"",
      "\"We are disappointed by the outcome of this election, but we are committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store,\" the company added.",
      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \"on-demand\" mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid. Whole Foods disputed the worker was fired in retaliation.",
      "The union has also accused Whole Foods of withholding region-wide wage increases from employees at the Philadelphia store because of the union activities.",
      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",
      "The company said it was delaying the pay bumps until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the vote with raises.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon has resisted union organizing efforts by its workers. Amazon delivery drivers went on strike in a handful of U.S. cities before Christmas to exert pressure on the the company to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",

    "story": [
      "A California woman was sentenced to more than three years behind bars for her role in a \"birth tourism\" scheme in which women traveled to the U.S. to give birth, giving the child birthright citizenship, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central District of California confirmed.",
      "Jing Dong, also known as Phoebe Dong, and her husband, Michael Wei Yueh Liu, were convicted in September on one charge each of conspiracy and 10 counts of international money laundering. Liu was sentenced last year to 41 months in prison, the same sentence Dong received.",
      "While the case is years old, the sentencing comes as President Donald Trump seeks to end birthright citizenship. He instituted an executive order in an attempt to end it, but a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked the order. Under the 14th Amendment, children born in the U.S. are considered American citizens. Some expectant mothers travel to the U.S. to give birth as a way of gaining American citizenship for their children.",
      "Dong and Liu were among more than a dozen people indicted in 2019 on birth tourism charges. The 19 individuals charged, who were linked to three different schemes, allegedly helped thousands give birth in the U.S. According to\u00a0authorities, the three businesses advertised the U.S. as being \"the most attractive nationality\" with better educational resources, including \"free education from junior high school to public high school.\"",
      "\"America's way of life is not for sale,\" Joseph Macias, then special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations Los Angeles, said in a 2019 press release about the indictments. \"HSI will aggressively target those who would make a mockery of our laws and our values to benefit and enrich themselves. No one needs to be reminded about the national security and public safety implications of visa fraud and the crimes associated with it. Anyone who would exploit our nation's generosity and our legal immigration system should be on notice - they may end up being the ones to pay a very steep price.\"",
      "Between January 2012 and March 2015, Dong and Liu charged Chinese clients tens of thousands of dollars to help them give birth in the U.S., according to the Department of Justice. They ran a maternity house in Rancho Cucamonga, California, and rented apartment units to pregnant Chinese women. The women would usually return to China within one to two months of giving birth.",
      "While pregnant individuals can visit the U.S., Customs and Border Protection on its website notes that officers will take into account a pregnant individual's due date and the length of time they plan to stay in the U.S. when deciding if that person will be allowed into the country.",
      "Liu and Dong would advise their customers on how to hide their pregnancies, authorities said. Through their business USA Happy Baby Inc., they'd advise customers to fly into the U.S. through \"ports of entry with perceived less customs scrutiny, such as Hawaii, before flying to Los Angeles, to wear loose fitting clothing, to favor certain lines at customs that they perceived to be less strict, and on how to answer the customs officials' questions,\" the Justice Department said.",

    "summary": "About a dozen Justice Department employees who worked for former special counsel Jack Smith on his investigation of Donald Trump are being fired.",
    "story": [
      "About a dozen Justice Department employees who worked for former special counsel Jack Smith on the investigation and prosecution of President Trump are being fired, two sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. The federal prosecutors were informed of the decision to terminate their positions via a letter sent over email after Justice Department leadership determined they were unable to carry out Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "\"Acting Attorney General James McHenry made this decision because he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,\" a Justice Department official told CBS News.",
      "Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 and took over two ongoing investigations of the president, one related to his handling of classified records and the other tied to his conduct following the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Both cases were dismissed after Mr. Trump won the 2024 presidential election. Smith informed the judges overseeing the cases that Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Throughout his probes, the former special counsel amassed a staff of prosecutors and agents to conduct grand jury investigations and try the cases in court. It is not immediately clear which members of Smith's team were fired, but the move makes good on a Trump campaign promise to clean house in the Justice Department. Last week, the president signed an executive order to take on the \"weaponization of the federal government,\" a characterization he applied to Smith's prosecutions.",
      "Fox News was first to report on the firings.",
      "The news of the firings came on the same day that Washington, D.C.'s top federal prosecutor launched an internal review of the charging decisions behind hundreds of Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot cases. Two people familiar with the move confirmed to CBS News that Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin ordered prosecutors in his office to turn in documents, emails and other information related to the previous administration's decision to bring an obstruction charge against more than 200 Capitol attack defendants.",
      "The cases at issue are those in which defendants were charged with obstruction of an official proceeding, a charge that the Supreme Court later ruled was too broadly applied by federal prosecutors.",
      "Throughout the sprawling Jan. 6 investigation that abruptly came to an end last week after President Trump pardoned more than 1,500 individuals, defendants and their attorneys brought challenges against the obstruction case on multiple fronts as they contested the Justice Department's application of the law in the Capitol riot cases. The Supreme Court ultimately limited prosecutors' use of the statute.",
      "The new review is set to examine the decision making behind the use of that charge, the people said.",
      "News of the review was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "The U.S. attorney's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Smith \u2014 who resigned from his position following the completion of his investigation \u2014\u00a0 wrote in his report on the probe that his team had collected evidence \"sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial,\" if the case involving Mr. Trump's alleged conduct around the 2020 election had gone to trial.",
      "Only the first volume of Smith's report, which described the investigation into Mr. Trump's post-2020 election conduct, was released to the public. The second volume is currently shielded from public view while an appeal in the classified documents case is ongoing.",
      "In the report, Smith defended his work as apolitical. And in a letter accompanying the final draft, he wrote, \"To all who know me well, the claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called Smith \"desperate\" and \"deranged\" and consistently denied wrongdoing throughout the investigations.",
      "Also on Monday, the chief of the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section resigned from his position after being reassigned, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. The official was appointed to the position during the first Trump administration, and his political corruption unit later advised Smith on various aspects of cases against Mr. Trump, according to court documents.",
      "NBC News first reported the resignation. The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Last week, numerous career Justice Department officials who held high-profile positions were reassigned.

    "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2025 20:09:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The FBI and NCIS say \"virtual espionage\" by China is ensnaring American troops in growing numbers.",
    "story": [
      "The Chinese intelligence officer who convinced Thomas Zhao to hand over sensitive information about the U.S. military seemed to know the 24-year-old U.S. Navy petty officer had a passion for the stock market.",
      "The agent approached Zhao in a stock trading chat group on the Chinese-owned social media network WeChat, CBS News learned in interviews with people involved in the case. But chats about investment strategies soon veered into sensitive areas, including questions about Naval exercises in the Pacific and designs for radar installations.",
      "The Zhao case represents a new dimension to Chinese covert activities that counterintelligence officials are calling \"virtual espionage.\" The practice, in which Chinese intelligence officers target members of the military and others of high interest on social media, draw them into correspondence, and extract sensitive information from them, is a rising threat, officials told CBS News.",
      "\"They will turn over every stone to try and collect what they can,\" Kevin Vorndran, who leads the FBI's counterintelligence division, told CBS News in a rare television interview. \"They are certainly endeavoring to target as many people as they can.\"",
      "Over the course of two years, a Chinese intelligence officer paid Zhao, a U.S. citizen and Navy engineer, about $15,000 to take photographs and videos of restricted areas at the Southern California base where he worked, court records revealed.",
      "With his relatively low rank, as well as a low-level security clearance, Zhao may have seemed like an unlikely target. Yet Vorndran and other U.S. officials told CBS News that intelligence officers working for the Chinese government are trolling professional networking sites, including LinkedIn, to seduce an array of American service members and others who hold U.S. government security clearances into turning over sensitive information.",
      "\"On professional networking sites, members of the military, former members of the military, list their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s,\" Vorndran said. \"It exposes their expertise. And through that, it makes targeting by an intelligence service simple to accomplish.\"",
      "A LinkedIn spokesperson did not respond to a question about whether Chinese intelligence officers were using the platform to identify potential targets, but did say in a statement that fraudulent accounts violate the company's terms of service.",
      "\"Our teams use a variety of automated technologies, combined with a team of trained investigation experts and member reporting, to help stop bad actors and to keep experiences on LinkedIn professional,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The tactic is low risk and high reward \u2014 a hallmark of the kind of \"virtual espionage\" China began leaning on when COVID made it more difficult for spies to travel abroad, according to counterintelligence officials.",
      "\"The intelligence officer can sit behind their desk back in China and reach out to numerous individuals all at once,\" said Ryan Norris, a special agent with the Navy's Criminal Investigative Service. \"They are reaching out to as many people as possible and hoping to get some response.\"",
      "In the last two years, federal law enforcement has identified a dozen such cases and brought charges against four service members recruited by suspected undercover agents of China. Vorndran said given the difficulty in policing this kind of outreach, he's concerned the number could be far higher.",
      "\"We investigate everyone we can identify and predicate an investigation on,\" said Vorndran. \"The ones that we don't know are the ones that concern me and keep me up.\"",
      "A spokesperson for China's embassy denied knowledge of the Zhao case, and did not address a question about whether its intelligence officers were contacting U.S. servicemembers online and soliciting sensitive information.",
      "\"China hopes that the United States will stop hyping up the so-called 'Chinese espionage' risk and stop exaggerating the 'China threat theory,' and inject more stability into Sino-US relations instead of setting up obstacles,\" the embassy spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Easy money",
      "In August 2023, agents with the FBI and NCIS descended on the Ventura County Naval Base, apprehended Zhao, and took him into a small room for questioning. A video of the interrogation, obtained by CBS News, shows Zhao admitting he sent sensitive military information to an individual he met online.",
      "While Zhao said the individual seemed \"fishy,\" it does not appear he knew he was dealing with a Chinese intelligence officer. And while he considered passing along photographs of what he was working on as an easy way to make money, he stopped short of sending any classified information.",
      "\"When I tried to cut off the relationship with him, it's already kinda late,\" Zhao said in the interrogation, telling the federal agents he felt \"trapped.\"",
      "Following the interrogation, Zhao was arrested. He later pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges, and is currently serving a 27-month federal sentence. Prosecutors determined his actions did not rise to the level of espionage. Still, Norris said he believes Zhao's actions amount to a betrayal.",
      "\"He absolutely betrayed his country,\" said Norris, who questioned Zhao during the interrogation. \"I think over the past two years he'd had a relationship that he knew was nefarious, and I think he was finally caught in what he was doing.\"",
      "Tarek Shawky, Zhao's attorney, said his client was also to some degree a victim of a scam. He said their social media conversations revealed the Chinese intelligence officer sought to build up a level of trust before asking for sensitive information.",
      "\"At a certain point, I think the human condition is that you want to suspend a little bit of your better judgment because of that human connection,\" Shawky said. \"That's what makes it so dangerous.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Zhao's wife Jianyu Ren said her husband acknowledged making a mistake, but she denied he would ever willfully sell out his country.",
      "\"That's not him,\" Ren said. \"If he had known this person was working for the Chinese government or anybody in China, he wouldn't have done that.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2025 16:52:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Senate Democrats are asking for documents related to allegations the nominee to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, prematurely confirmed hostage rescue details.",
    "story": [
      "Days before this week's high-stakes confirmation hearing of Kash Patel to be FBI director, a bureau insider has come forward with new information questioning Patel's judgment during sensitive hostage rescue missions, CBS News has learned.",
      "The whistleblower, whose identity is being withheld by Senate Democrats for fear of retaliation, worked with the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which leads the government's missions to rescue hostages overseas. The whistleblower alleges that Patel violated firmly entrenched protocols to keep such operations under wraps until the captives are safely in U.S. hands and their families have been notified.",
      "In a letter obtained by CBS News, Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote that Patel, while serving on the National Security Council during the first Trump term, \"broke protocol regarding hostage rescues by publicly commenting without authorization on the then-in-progress retrieval of two Americans held captive by Iranian-backed militants in Yemen in October 2020.\"",
      "According to the letter, on Oct. 14 at 10:55 a.m., the Wall Street Journal published a story in which Patel confirmed that the two American captives and the remains of a third were exchanged for two hundred Houthi fighters who were being held in Saudi Arabia. According to the letter, the news report was published \"several hours before the hostages were in the confirmed custody of the United States.\" In the end the Americans returned home safely, but FBI officials involved in the mission were livid over Patel's leak, which they regarded as reckless and potentially risking tragic results.",
      "Democratic senators sent the letter Monday morning to Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Acting Treasury Secretary David Lebryk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. It asks for all records of communications between Patel and the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell concerning the rescue of the captives, as well as any records reflecting authorization for him to disclose the hostage deal before there was confirmation that the Americans were safely in U.S, hands.",
      "No Republican senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee signed the letter.",
      "A source close to the confirmation said in response to the allegations, \"Mr. Patel was a public defender, decorated prosecutor and accomplished national security official that kept Americans safe. He has a track record of success in every branch of government, from the court room to congressional hearing room to the situation room. There is no veracity to this anonymous source's complaints about protocol.\"",
      "Alex Gray, former chief of staff for the National Security Council during the first Trump administration, said in a statement, \"The anonymous allegations in this letter are simply absurd to anyone who has ever actually worked with Kash Patel. In everything he did at the NSC and DoD, Kash put the interests of the American people, and particularly the interests of American hostages and unlawful detainees and their families, first.\"",
      "\"The success President Trump and his NSC had on the counter terrorism and hostage recovery missions was in no small part due to Kash's skill and professionalism,\" Gray said. He referred to the whistleblower's allegations as \"baseles\" and \"the last gasp of discredited political opponents of President Trump.\"",
      "The Durbin letter offers a glimpse into the Democratic strategy for Thursday's confirmation hearing. Knowledgeable sources tell CBS News that senators will seek to show that Patel has engaged in a pattern of poor judgment and self-aggrandizement regarding sensitive life-and-death missions and use that portrayal to cast doubt on his fitness to lead the FBI.",
      "The letter says any official \"who puts missions or the lives of Americans in jeopardy for public notoriety and personal gain is unfit to lead the country's primary federal law enforcement and investigative agency.\"",
      "The Democrats plan to highlight another instance where Patel has been criticized for his handling of a sensitive operation aimed at freeing American captives. Two weeks after the Yemen hostage deal, Patel found himself in the middle of another high-risk operation. Philip Walton was a 27-year-old American who had been seized by armed men at his farm in Niger, near the Nigerian border.",
      "The kidnappers transported Walton to Nigeria and demanded a million dollars in ransom. There were also indications that the kidnappers were contemplating turning him over to a terrorist group operating in the region. Patel was accompanying President Trump on a visit to Fort Bragg, the military installation in North Carolina that is home to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command. While they were there, Patel received intelligence that Walton would be held at an encampment for several hours, enough time to stage a daring Seal Team 6 raid to rescue the hostage. Mr. Trump signed off on the operation, which involved parachuting into Northern Nigeria and trekking for miles to the compound where Walton was being held.",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper had greenlit the plan, but there were still some final questions that needed to be answered before he could give the go order \u2013 primarily whether the Nigerian government had given the U.S. permission to use its air space. According to Esper's memoir, Patel, who was the senior director for counterterrorism at the time, assured Defense Department officials that the State Department had received the necessary permission from the Nigerians. But Patel's information was incorrect: the Nigerians had not given their approval.",
      "By this time, Air Force planes carrying the Navy SEALs were in the air just a few miles from the Nigerian border. Esper wrote in his memoir, \"A Sacred Oath,\" he realized the government had to make an agonizing decision. He told the White House they could go forward with the operation and risk having their planes shot down \u2014 or abort the mission and miss a crucial opportunity to save Walton.\u00a0 But at the last minute, word came that the State Department had received clearance to use Nigerian airspace. The mission went forward, was executed flawlessly, and Walton was returned to safety.",
      "But Esper and other officials were furious at the role Patel had played, believing he had inserted himself into the operation in violation of regular protocol, and then nearly botched it by transmitting false information. According to Esper's account, Patel's carelessness carried significant risk for the SEALs.",
      "\"I was concerned that being packed in an aircraft burning holes in the sky for an extra hour or so would wear on the special operators, that it might affect their readiness somehow,\" he wrote in his memoir.",
      "Esper also wrote of the incident, \"My team suspected Patel made the approval story up, but they didn't have all the facts.\"",
      "Patel has denied Esper's version of events. In his own book, \"Government Gangsters,\" Patel portrays Esper as a \"deep-state\" actor who \"always seemed to be subverting the president's agenda,\" including by putting up obstacles to counterterrorism raids in Africa and the Middle East.\" He argued that Mr. Trump had the ultimate authority to order the mission.",
      "Last week, Durbin met with Patel and asked him about Esper's account of his role in the nearly botched Nigerian raid. Sources said Patel again refuted Esper's version of events. Durbin did not yet have the whistleblower's information about the Yemen hostage deal, but he is expected to closely question the FBI nominee about that episode at Thursday's confirmation hearing.",
      "However Patel's answers those questions, there is no suspense as to how Durbin and his fellow Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote. After his meeting with Patel, Durbin issued a statement saying he will not vote to confirm Patel.",
      "\"Kash Patel has neither the experience, the temperament, nor the judgment to lead the FBI,\" his statement said.",

      "U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta said Monday, \"[I]t would be improper for the court post-commutation to modify the original sentences,\" but because President Trump's clemency \"can reasonably be read to extinguish enforcement of Defendants' terms of supervised release,\" the judge vacated his order.",
      "Mehta on Friday had ordered the Oath Keeper members Rhodes, Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins, Roberto Minuta, Edward Vallejo, David Moerchel, and Joseph Hacket to be barred from entering Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Capitol building \"without first obtaining the permission from the Court.\"",
      "The decision prompted staunch opposition from Washington, D.C. Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin, who wrote that the defendants, including Rhodes, were \"no longer subject to the terms of supervised release and probation.\"",
      "Mehta, in reversing his decision, said he ultimately found Martin's interpretation of President Trump's unconditional commutation\u00a0 to be \"reasonable.\"",
      "Last week, as part of the mass clemency Mr. Trump extended to those tied to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, he pardoned over 1,500 defendants, but opted to commute the sentences of Rhodes, his co-defendants and certain members of the Proud Boys group who were also charged with seditious conspiracy. Not all of those who received commutations were ultimately convicted of the seditious conspiracy charge.",
      "Days after receiving commutation, Rhodes and other Jan. 6 defendants appeared on Capitol Hill.",
      "The judge wrote that while the parties initially operated \"as if the commutations addressed only the custodial portions of Defendants' sentences but not their terms of supervised release,\" upon further review and in response to objections from the defendants, he found that once a commutation is issued for a defendant, they are \"required to take no further action to receive its benefit.\"",
      "\"It is not for this court to divine why President Trump commuted Defendants' sentences, or to assess whether it was sensible to do so,\" Mehta added.",

      "The suspects were reportedly three men who covered themselves in face paint during the raids and became known for their ruthless attacks, the BBC reported. Some of the victims were tortured before being killed.",
      "The gang's members were dubbed the \"The Giant,\" \"The Killer\" and \"The Old Man,\" the BBC reported.",
      "Theories piled up over the years to explain the crime spree -- with the sums involved tiny, and money an unlikely motive.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2025 20:09:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The FBI and NCIS say \"virtual espionage\" by China is ensnaring American troops in growing numbers.",
    "story": [
      "The Chinese intelligence officer who convinced Thomas Zhao to hand over sensitive information about the U.S. military seemed to know the 24-year-old U.S. Navy petty officer had a passion for the stock market.",
      "The agent approached Zhao in a stock trading chat group on the Chinese-owned social media network WeChat, CBS News learned in interviews with people involved in the case. But chats about investment strategies soon veered into sensitive areas, including questions about Naval exercises in the Pacific and designs for radar installations.",
      "The Zhao case represents a new dimension to Chinese covert activities that counterintelligence officials are calling \"virtual espionage.\" The practice, in which Chinese intelligence officers target members of the military and others of high interest on social media, draw them into correspondence, and extract sensitive information from them, is a rising threat, officials told CBS News.",
      "\"They will turn over every stone to try and collect what they can,\" Kevin Vorndran, who leads the FBI's counterintelligence division, told CBS News in a rare television interview. \"They are certainly endeavoring to target as many people as they can.\"",
      "Over the course of two years, a Chinese intelligence officer paid Zhao, a U.S. citizen and Navy engineer, about $15,000 to take photographs and videos of restricted areas at the Southern California base where he worked, court records revealed.",
      "With his relatively low rank, as well as a low-level security clearance, Zhao may have seemed like an unlikely target. Yet Vorndran and other U.S. officials told CBS News that intelligence officers working for the Chinese government are trolling professional networking sites, including LinkedIn, to seduce an array of American service members and others who hold U.S. government security clearances into turning over sensitive information.",
      "\"On professional networking sites, members of the military, former members of the military, list their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s,\" Vorndran said. \"It exposes their expertise. And through that, it makes targeting by an intelligence service simple to accomplish.\"",
      "A LinkedIn spokesperson did not respond to a question about whether Chinese intelligence officers were using the platform to identify potential targets, but did say in a statement that fraudulent accounts violate the company's terms of service.",
      "\"Our teams use a variety of automated technologies, combined with a team of trained investigation experts and member reporting, to help stop bad actors and to keep experiences on LinkedIn professional,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The tactic is low risk and high reward \u2014 a hallmark of the kind of \"virtual espionage\" China began leaning on when COVID made it more difficult for spies to travel abroad, according to counterintelligence officials.",
      "\"The intelligence officer can sit behind their desk back in China and reach out to numerous individuals all at once,\" said Ryan Norris, a special agent with the Navy's Criminal Investigative Service. \"They are reaching out to as many people as possible and hoping to get some response.\"",
      "In the last two years, federal law enforcement has identified a dozen such cases and brought charges against four service members recruited by suspected undercover agents of China. Vorndran said given the difficulty in policing this kind of outreach, he's concerned the number could be far higher.",
      "\"We investigate everyone we can identify and predicate an investigation on,\" said Vorndran. \"The ones that we don't know are the ones that concern me and keep me up.\"",
      "A spokesperson for China's embassy denied knowledge of the Zhao case, and did not address a question about whether its intelligence officers were contacting U.S. servicemembers online and soliciting sensitive information.",
      "\"China hopes that the United States will stop hyping up the so-called 'Chinese espionage' risk and stop exaggerating the 'China threat theory,' and inject more stability into Sino-US relations instead of setting up obstacles,\" the embassy spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Easy money",
      "In August 2023, agents with the FBI and NCIS descended on the Ventura County Naval Base, apprehended Zhao, and took him into a small room for questioning. A video of the interrogation, obtained by CBS News, shows Zhao admitting he sent sensitive military information to an individual he met online.",
      "While Zhao said the individual seemed \"fishy,\" it does not appear he knew he was dealing with a Chinese intelligence officer. And while he considered passing along photographs of what he was working on as an easy way to make money, he stopped short of sending any classified information.",
      "\"When I tried to cut off the relationship with him, it's already kinda late,\" Zhao said in the interrogation, telling the federal agents he felt \"trapped.\"",
      "Following the interrogation, Zhao was arrested. He later pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges, and is currently serving a 27-month federal sentence. Prosecutors determined his actions did not rise to the level of espionage. Still, Norris said he believes Zhao's actions amount to a betrayal.",
      "\"He absolutely betrayed his country,\" said Norris, who questioned Zhao during the interrogation. \"I think over the past two years he'd had a relationship that he knew was nefarious, and I think he was finally caught in what he was doing.\"",
      "Tarek Shawky, Zhao's attorney, said his client was also to some degree a victim of a scam. He said their social media conversations revealed the Chinese intelligence officer sought to build up a level of trust before asking for sensitive information.",
      "\"At a certain point, I think the human condition is that you want to suspend a little bit of your better judgment because of that human connection,\" Shawky said. \"That's what makes it so dangerous.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Zhao's wife Jianyu Ren said her husband acknowledged making a mistake, but she denied he would ever willfully sell out his country.",
      "\"That's not him,\" Ren said. \"If he had known this person was working for the Chinese government or anybody in China, he wouldn't have done that.\"",

      "\"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\"",
      "The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said.",
      "As A23a ultimately melted it could seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",

      "The Japanese network Fuji Television and its parent company said Monday that its president and chairperson were resigning immediately to take responsibility for a widening sex assault scandal linked to one of Japan's top TV celebrities.",
      "The scandal centers on Masahiro Nakai, a former leader of Japan's once-hugely popular boy band SMAP, and his costly settlement with a woman over the alleged sex assault at a 2023 dinner party that Fuji TV staff allegedly helped to organize.",
      "The allegations surfaced in magazine articles in December and have since triggered claims of systematic cover-ups by Fuji TV executives. The public outrage over the lack of transparency and explanation at the network's news conference earlier this month have led to an avalanche of advertising losses at Fuji, one of the networks where Nakai worked.",
      "Fuji Television Network President Koichi Minato said his company mishandled the case.",

      "Minato said the case violated the woman's human rights, without providing details on grounds of privacy. He said it was handled as an \"extraordinary\" case requiring maximum confidentiality and sensitivity for the woman's mental health and was shared by a small group of officials. The company had continued allowing Nakai to appear on Fuji shows for a year and six months, he said, but denied covering up the case because it involved a big star.",
      "Minato said he did not think what happened was sexual assault and that the case was not reported to the company's compliance office until the magazine report came out.",
      "He also denied a Fuji TV employee's involvement but said allegations that the employee had previously organized barbecue and other parties for Nakai needed to be investigated.",
      "Fuji officials also acknowledged that female announcers and other female employees have in the past participated at parties for stars, talent agency executives and sponsors, though they denied any sexual services. Minato said he believed top officials were complacent about the outdated gender roles and they now need to \"update their mindset.\"",
      "Nakai last Thursday announced his retirement from show business\u00a0in Japan, which has already been hit by a series of sexual assault allegations in recent years in what is seen as a delayed #MeToo movement that began in Western nations in the 2010s. He said he was taking responsibility for the \"trouble\" and massive business losses as a result.",
      "\"I alone am responsible for everything\" and \"sincerely apologize,\" Nakai said.",
      "He had previously issued a statement saying some of what had been reported was \"different from the facts.\"",
      "Minato said he last saw the woman last summer when she visited his office to tell him she was quitting.",

      "The chair of the companies, Shuji Kanoh, was also resigning in a decision made at a board meeting prior to the Jan. 17 news conference, officials said.",
      "Japan's entertainment industry is in the midst of a wave of sexual assault cases, including the abuses of hundreds of boys and young men by late talent mogul Johnny Kitagawa, whose now-defunct agency Johnny & Associates managed many boy bands, including the one to which Nakai belonged.",

      "Doral, Florida \u2014\u00a0President Trump's push to have Egypt and Jordan take in large numbers of Palestinian refugees from besieged Gaza fell flat with those countries' governments and left a key congressional ally in Washington perplexed on Sunday.",
      "Fighting that broke out in the territory after ruling Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023 is paused due to a fragile ceasefire, but most of Gaza's population has been left homeless by the Israeli military campaign. Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday aboard Air Force One that moving some 1.5 million people away from Gaza might mean that \"we just clean out that whole thing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump relayed what he told Jordan's King Abdullah when the two held a call earlier Saturday: \"I said to him, 'I'd love for you to take on more because I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it's a mess.'\"",
      "He said he was making a similar appeal to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi during a conversation they were having while Trump was at his Doral resort in Florida on Sunday. Mr. Trump said he would \"like Egypt to take people and I'd like Jordan to take people.\"",
      "Hamas, Egypt and Jordan reject Trump's Gaza suggestion",
      "Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians were allowed by Israeli forces on Monday to start returning to their towns and villages in the decimated northern half of Gaza, sparking a mass migration seen as a powerful repudiation of the concept of any mass-deportation from Gaza.",
      "In a statement posted online Monday, spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou of the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group Hamas, which has ruled over Gaza for almost two decades, said the scenes of people returning in vast numbers to the north \"represent another failure of the occupation in achieving the goals of the war of extermination and destruction, and a message of defiance to any new attempt to displace them.\"",
      "\"The steadfastness of our people on their land and their return from the south of the Gaza Strip to its north represents the end of the Zionist dream of displacing them and liquidating their just cause,\" said al-Qanou.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, along with the Palestinians, worry that Israel would never allow the Palestinians to return to Gaza if they are made to leave. Both Egypt and Jordan also have perpetually struggling economies and their governments, as well as those of other Arab states, fear massive destabilization of their own countries and the region from any such influx of refugees.",
      "Jordan already is home to more than 2 million Palestinian refugees. Egypt has warned of the security implications of transferring large numbers of Palestinians to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, bordering Gaza.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that resettling most of Gaza's population of 2.3 million could be temporary or long term.",
      "Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said Sunday that his country's opposition to what Trump floated was \"firm and unwavering.\"",
      "Some Israel officials had raised the idea early in the war.",
      "Egypt's foreign minister issued a statement saying that the temporary or long-term transfer of Palestinians \"risks expanding the conflict in the region.\"",
      "In the statement, the ministry reaffirmed \"Egypt's commitment to the principles and parameters of a political solution to the Palestinian issue, stressing that it remains the central issue in the Middle East. The delay in resolving it, ending the occupation, and restoring the stolen rights of the Palestinian people is the root cause of instability in the region.",
      "\"In this context, Egypt reiterates its continued support for the steadfastness of the Palestinian people on their land and their adherence to their legitimate rights in their land and homeland, as well as to the principles of international law and international humanitarian law. It also emphasizes its rejection of any infringement upon those inalienable rights, whether through settlement activities, annexation of land, or the eviction of the rightful owners through displacement or encouraging the transfer or uprooting of Palestinians from their land, whether temporarily or permanently.\"",
      "Mr. Trump does have some leverage over Jordan, which is a debt-strapped, but strategically important U.S. ally and is heavily dependent on foreign aid. The U.S. is historically the single-largest provider of that aid, including more than $1.6 billion through the State Department in 2023. Much of that comes as support for Jordan's security forces and direct budget support.",
      "Jordan in return has been a vital regional partner to the U.S. in trying to help keep the region stable. Jordan hosts some 3,000 U.S. troops. Yet, on Friday, new Secretary of State Marco Rubio exempted security assistance to Israel and Egypt, but not to Jordan when he laid out the details of a freeze on foreign assistance that Mr. Trump ordered on his first day in office.",

      "In Italy, right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who attended Mr. Trump's inauguration and has sought to position herself as an interlocutor between the new U.S. administration and Europe, tried to downplay the president's Gaza suggestion.",
      "\"Trump is right when he says that the reconstruction of Gaza is obviously one of the main challenges we face, and that to succeed, however, a great deal of involvement from the international community is needed,\" she told reporters during a visit to Saudi Arabia. \"As for the issue of refugees, I don't think, here again, that we are faced with a defined plan [from Mr. Trump]. I think we are rather faced with discussions with regional actors, who certainly need to be involved in this.\"",
      "ga\"These are certainly very complex matters, but the fact that they are being discussed, even at an informal level with the actors in the region, in my opinion means that we want to work seriously on the issue of the reconstruction of Gaza,\" the Italian leader said.",

      "Meanwhile, in the U.S., even some Republicans loyal to Mr. Trump were left trying to make sense of his words.",
      "\"I really don't know,'' said Sen. Lindsey Graham, when asked on CNN's \"State of the Union\" about what the president meant by the \"clean out\" remark. Graham, who is close to Mr. Trump, said the suggestion was not feasible.",
      "\"The idea that all the Palestinians are going to leave and go somewhere else, I don't see that to be overly practical,\" said Graham, a veteran GOP senator from South Carolina. He said Mr. Trump should keep talking to Mideast leaders, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and officials in the United Arab Emirates.",
      "\"I don't know what he's talking about. But go talk to MBS, go talk to UAE, go talk to Egypt,\" Graham said. \"What is their plan for the Palestinians? Do they want them all to leave?\"",

      "Mr. Trump, a staunch supporter of Israel, also announced Saturday that he had directed the U.S. to release a supply of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. Former President Joe Biden had imposed a hold on the specific weapons due to concerns about their effects on Gaza's civilian population.",
      "Egypt and Jordan have made peace with Israel but support the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War. They fear that the permanent displacement of Gaza's population could make that so-called \"two-state solution\" impossible.",
      "Mr. Trump is also seen in the Middle East as being less supportive of an eventual two-state solution than previous U.S. administrations, and Israel's current government has all but ruled out the creation of an independent Palestinian state.",

      "Water is known to be a great resource for good health, but sparkling water could also offer unique benefits.",
      "A new report, published in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention and Health, suggests that carbonated water may support weight loss by enhancing glucose uptake and metabolism in red blood cells.",
      "The researchers aimed to analyze the physiological effects of carbonated water, as it has been found to induce satiety (feelings of fullness) and gastric motility (movement of food through the body), both of which could reduce hunger.",
      "KELLY RIPA SAYS QUITTING ALCOHOL HAD A SURPRISING EFFECT ON HER WEIGHT",
      "In analyzing a study from 2004, the team found that carbonated water may support weight loss by converting to HCO3 \u2013 a byproduct of metabolism \u2013 in red blood cells and increasing energy production.",
      "Carbonated water that is high in sodium has also been shown to lower blood glucose levels, the report noted. (iStock)",
      "But the effect of this is \"so small,\" the researchers concluded, that it is \"difficult to expect weight loss effects solely from the CO2 in carbonated water.\"",
      "Therefore, the researchers noted that sparkling water should not be used on its own as a weight-loss solution, and should instead be \"integrated into a broader strategy of healthy living.\"",
      "\u2018Unlikely\u2019 to do it alone",
      "Study researcher Dr. Akira Takahashi, head of medicine at Tesseikai Neurosurgical Hospital in Osaka, Japan, conducted the original research 20 years ago.",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Takahashi said this new report underscores how carbonated water impacts weight loss by promoting the sensation of fullness, which can reduce food intake and lower overall calorie consumption.",
      "OZEMPIC'S HEALTH BENEFITS KEEP GROWING, BUT ARE THE RISKS WORTH IT?",
      "Carbonated water burning calories through CO2 absorption is \"insufficient to make a significant difference,\" the researcher noted.",
      "\"For instance, during hemodialysis, even with a continuous supply of CO\u2082 for four hours, only about 9.5g of glucose is consumed,\" he said. \"It would be extremely challenging to drink carbonated water continuously for that duration.\"",

      "\"The sensation of fullness when drinking carbonated beverages is thought to result from their physical properties,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "Weight loss can occur when engaging in increased physical activity, decreasing caloric intake and eating a healthier selection of food, which includes minimizing ultraprocessed, fried and sugary foods, the nutritionist said.",
      "Carbonated consequences",
      "While bubbles in carbonated water can create a full feeling, there are also consequences of overindulging, according to DeCicco.",
      "\"I can see how drinking carbonated water can make people less hungry because the bubbles do create a feeling of more fullness, so with that being said, people may skip a snack if they\u2019re drinking seltzer, thus reducing caloric intake for the day,\" she commented.",

      "On the other hand, DeCicco cautioned, carbonated beverages can make individuals feel bloated and gassy, and can aggravate reflux issues.",

      "\"If you saw her on the street, you would have no idea that she\u2019s the only person in the world walking around with a pig organ inside them that\u2019s functioning,\" Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led Looney\u2019s transplant, said.",
      "Montgomery said Looney\u2019s kidney function is \"absolutely normal.\" She has been staying in New York temporarily so she can receive post-transplant checkups, but doctors hope she can return to her home in Gadsden, Alabama, in about a month.",
      "\"We\u2019re quite optimistic that this is going to continue to work and work well for, you know, a significant period of time,\" Montgomery said.",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs, so their organs are more human-like to support a severe shortage of human organs that can be used for transplants.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list. Most of these individuals need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration only allows pig organ transplants in special circumstances for people who have run out of other alternatives.",
      "Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the world\u2019s first pig kidney transplant last year and works with another pig developer, eGenesis, said how well Looney does is a \"very precious experience.\"",
      "Towana Looney sits for an NYU Langone Health press conference on Tuesday, December 17, 2024. (Fox News)",
      "Looney was far healthier than previous pig organ recipients, according to Kawai, who said her progress will help inform doctors about future attempts.",
      "\"We have to learn from each other,\" he said.",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999 and later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed, a rare circumstance among living donors.",
      "She spent eight years on dialysis before doctors determined she was unlikely to receive a donated organ, as she had developed very high levels of antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney.",
      "Looney, seeking an alternative, wanted to try out the pig organ experiment. Nobody knew how it would work in someone \"highly sensitized\" with the overactive antibodies.",
      "Montgomery\u2019s team has closely tracked Looney's recovery through blood tests and other measurements since the Nov. 25 surgery. About three weeks after the transplant, subtle signs were detected that rejection was beginning. They knew to look for these signs because of a 2023 experiment when a pig kidney worked for 61 days inside a deceased man whose body was donated for research.",

      "Montgomery said his team successfully treated Looney and there have not been signs of rejection since.",
      "It is impossible to predict how long Looney\u2019s new kidney will work. But if it were to fail, she could receive dialysis again.",
      "\"The truth is we don\u2019t really know what the next hurdles are because this is the first time we\u2019ve gotten this far,\" Montgomery said. \"We\u2019ll have to continue to really keep a close eye on her.\"",

      "A White House official told Fox News Digital that the memo was initially \"misreported\" and does not constitute a funding freeze on federal financial assistance across the board. The official said the pause is expressly limited to programs, projects, and activities that may be impacted by President Donald Trump's executive orders, such as ending diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), the Green New Deal, and funding nongovernmental organizations that the White House suspect undermine national interest.",
      "The memo exempts any program that provides direct benefits to Americans from the review process. That includes Social Security, Medicare and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the official said.",

      "\"This is a good government measure to ensure that taxpayer money is being spent in accordance with law and the President\u2019s policies,\" the official said in defense of the memo. \"The Biden Administration forced their extreme ideological views into every corner of government and weaponized the government against the American people. They were taking actions up until the last hours trying to tie the hands of President Trump from delivering for the American people.\"",
      "The White House official told Fox News Digital that the pause is not yet in effect and \"was designed to give agencies lead time to begin determining which programs are not affected and which programs will need to be reviewed for conformity with the President\u2019s executive orders.\" The official further explained that the directive includes a \"safety valve\" that the pause \"shall only occur as consistent with law, which will allow agencies to review spending in conformity with applicable laws.\"",
      "\"If the activity is not in conflict with the President\u2019s priorities, it will continue with no issues,\" the White House official told Fox News Digital. \"This is similar to how HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] stopped the flow of grant money to the WHO [World Health Organization] after President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the organization. Or how the State Department halted several million dollars going to condoms in Gaza this past weekend.\"",
      "The memo, which takes effect Tuesday at 5 p.m., said agencies \"must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the Green New Deal,\" according to the Journal.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., holds a news conference to speak out against the nomination of Russell Vought on Jan. 23, 2025. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",

      "Each agency must \"complete a comprehensive analysis of all their Federal financial assistance programs to identify programs, projects and activities that may be implicated by any of the President\u2019s executive orders,\" the memo continued, according to the Journal, adding that the pause must be applied \"to the extent permissible under applicable law.\"",
      "AFTER RAUCOUS FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE, DONALD TRUMP TO KEEP HIS FOOT ON THE GAS",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., condemned the memo, telling the Journal that pausing the funding puts \"billions upon billions of community grants and financial support that help millions of people across the country\" at risk.",
      "\"It will mean missed payrolls and rent payments and everything in between: chaos for everything from universities to non-profit charities, state disaster assistance, local law enforcement, aid to the elderly, and food for those in need,\" Schumer said, adding that Congress approved the funding for the federal assistance programs.",
      "However, the White House official denied that the memo would result in any devastating effects on programs, explaining to Fox News Digital that the OMB explicitly instructed agencies to identify programs with immediate deadlines so that \"exceptions can be granted without any program impact.\" It does not constitute a permeant stop of the funds.\u00a0The pause \"could be as short as a day if an agency determines that the funds at issue do not conflict with the Administration\u2019s policies,\" the official said. \"To act as faithful stewards of taxpayer money, new administrations must review federal programs to ensure that they are being executed in accordance with the law and the new President\u2019s policies. If the pause will have an adverse impact, the memo expressly provides that agencies can seek exemptions on a case-by-case basis.\"",

      "1) Verify directly with toll operators:\u00a0If you receive a message about unpaid tolls or fines, do not click on any links. Instead, visit the official website of your toll operator or contact their customer service directly to verify the claim.",
      "2) Install strong antivirus software: The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Do not share personal information:\u00a0Never provide sensitive details like payment card information, Social Security numbers or one-time passwords via text or unverified websites. Legitimate toll operators will not request such information through SMS.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for your accounts whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of protection by requiring two forms of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if some details are compromised.",
      "5) Be wary of urgency in messages:\u00a0Scammers often create a sense of urgency, claiming immediate action is required to avoid penalties. Take a moment to assess the situation and verify the legitimacy of the message through official channels.",
      "6) Report suspicious messages:\u00a0If you suspect a phishing attempt, report it to the Federal Trade Commission or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. Include details like the sender\u2019s phone number and any links in the message. Additionally, inform your mobile carrier to help block similar scams.",
      "7) Use a personal data removal service: Employ a reputable data removal service to reduce your online footprint and minimize the risk of scammers obtaining your personal information. These services can help remove your data from various data broker sites, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "With so much of our lives having moved online, identity thieves are having an easier time than ever. Your most important accounts \u2013 banking, credit, Social Security \u2013 are all digital. Thieves don\u2019t need to know much about you to steal your identity, just a few pieces of personal information can be enough. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics,\u00a024 million Americans reported identity theft in the past 12 months. In their lifetime,\u00a01 in 3 Americans (more than 110 million people) have experienced identity theft. Here\u2019s the part many people don\u2019t realize: You might have already been a target. Maybe your identity was stolen, and the thieves failed, or maybe your good online habits saved you without you even knowing, which brings us to the next lesson: prevention.",

      "1) Check your accounts regularly:\u00a0Review your bank, credit card and Social Security accounts for transactions you didn\u2019t make,\u00a0failed login attempts and password reset requests you didn\u2019t initiate.",

      "4) Use two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a02FA adds extra layers of security to your accounts. Even if a thief has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without a second step, like a code sent via text message or app-based verification. While logging in might take an extra moment, it\u2019s worth it; 2FA dramatically increases account security.",
      "5) Check your credit report annually: Visit AnnualCreditReport.com to get your free credit report once a year. Use it to spot suspicious activity early. If you see something unusual, take action right away.",
      "6) Use strong passwords: Use complex passwords and a\u00a0password manager to secure your online accounts. Strong passwords are your first line of defense against cyber threats.",

      "Another sneaky tactic is\u00a0phishing, where scammers trick you into giving away your card info by posing as legitimate companies via emails or fake websites.",
      "There\u2019s also the risk of \"card skimming,\" where devices at ATMs or gas stations secretly capture your card details when you swipe it. In some cases, fraudsters might also exploit weak security on\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks or compromised apps to access your information while you\u2019re shopping online.",

With four out of five American adults owning at least one credit card, the report found that three in five cardholders have faced unauthorized charges \u2014 an estimated 128 million victims. Even more concerning, 75% of these victims reported having their credit card information stolen more than once.",
      "The typical unauthorized transaction is around $100, which adds up to approximately $5 billion in criminal purchases each year. Interestingly, most unauthorized transactions involve credit cards that weren\u2019t physically lost or stolen, highlighting the growing risks of online fraud and data breaches.",

      "The need for identity theft protection",
      "Data breaches are one of the main ways credit card fraud happens. Hackers often get unauthorized access to sensitive information stored by businesses or institutions. When a retailer, financial institution or online store experiences a data breach, the hackers usually go after the payment systems where customer credit card details are kept.",
      "If these systems aren\u2019t properly secured, hackers can grab things like credit card numbers, expiration dates and sometimes even security codes. Once they have that info, they can either use it themselves or sell it to others.",
      "But it\u2019s not just credit card information at risk.\u00a0Data breaches can also expose personal details like names, email addresses and phone numbers. Scammers can then use this stolen info to launch phishing attacks, pretending to be trusted companies and tricking you into giving away more sensitive information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "This is why identity theft monitoring is so important. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "1. Notify your credit card issuer immediately: If you notice fraudulent charges on your credit card, start by calling the number on the back of your credit card. From there, you should get more detailed information on what to do next.",
      "2. Monitor your statements regularly: One of the best ways to catch credit card fraud early is to keep an eye on your statements. Review your transactions regularly to spot any unfamiliar charges. The sooner you notice something suspicious, the quicker you can report it to your credit card company and prevent further damage.",
      "3. Regularly check your credit report: In addition to monitoring your credit card statements, periodically review your credit report to catch any unauthorized accounts opened in your name.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords: Always use strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, especially those that store payment details. Avoid using easily guessable information, and consider using a\u00a0password manager to store and generate secure passwords. This reduces the chances of fraudsters accessing your accounts.",
      "5. Use credit card alerts:\u00a0Set up transaction alerts with your credit card company. This way, you\u2019ll receive a notification via email or text for every transaction made with your card. If you receive an alert for a purchase you didn\u2019t make, you can take immediate action to report it and prevent further charges.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Be Cautious with public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Avoid making purchases or entering sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks because they\u2019re often not secure. If you need to make an online purchase while on the go, consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt your connection and keep your credit card details safe from hackers.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Don't store credit card info on browsers and websites:\u00a0Storing your credit card information on browsers or websites can make it convenient, but it also exposes you to a higher risk of fraud. If your browser or the website\u2019s security gets compromised, hackers could gain access to your saved card details. To stay safe, avoid saving your credit card information and manually enter it each time you make a purchase. If a site offers to save your details for future use, think twice before accepting. It's better to take the extra step to enter your information each time, ensuring your data stays secure.",
      "8. Use EMV chip technology: When making in-person purchases, always use the chip reader instead of swiping your card. Chip technology provides an extra layer of security against fraud.",
      "9. Be wary of phishing attempts and have strong antivirus software: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, texts or phone calls asking for your credit card information. Legitimate companies typically don't request sensitive information through these channels. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10. Keep your card in sight:\u00a0When using your card in restaurants or stores, try to keep it within view. This reduces the risk of someone copying your card details.",

By staying vigilant and employing best practices \u2014 like monitoring your statements and using strong passwords \u2014 you can significantly reduce your risk.

      "It's easier than you think to check for tracking software on your device. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson offers you some tips to help stay secure.",
      "Nowadays, almost every app you download asks for location permissions, meaning it wants to track where you are and your movements. For an app like Google Maps, requesting location access makes perfect sense. It's also reasonable for apps like Uber or DoorDash, which rely on location for their services.",
      "However, many apps that have nothing to do with location still ask for it, and we often grant these permissions without thinking twice. When you give an app access to your location, that data is stored and, in some cases, might even be sold. According to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, this practice is not uncommon.",

The data was gathered through secretly embedded software in mobile apps, such as Life360.\u00a0\"Allstate and other insurers then used the covertly obtained data to justify raising Texans\u2019 insurance rates,\" the press release stated.",
      "The insurance provider allegedly collected trillions of miles' worth of location data from more than 45 million Americans nationwide. The data was reportedly used to build the \"world\u2019s largest driving behavior database.\" When customers sought a quote or renewed their coverage, Allstate and other insurance companies allegedly used the database to justify raising car insurance premiums.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from unwanted tracking",
      "1. Avoid installing the insurance company\u2019s app:\u00a0Many insurance companies encourage users to download their apps to \"simplify\" claims, payments or policy management. However, these apps often collect and track your location data under the guise of improving their services. If the app is not absolutely essential, manage your account through the company\u2019s website or contact customer service directly instead.",
      "2. Don\u2019t give location permissions unnecessarily:\u00a0When an app requests location access, ask yourself whether it genuinely needs this information to function. For example, a weather app may need approximate location data, but a flashlight app does not.\u00a0 Always choose \"Deny\" or \"Allow only while using the app\" unless absolutely necessary. Most modern devices also allow you to provide an approximate location rather than a precise one, which is a safer option when location access is unavoidable.",
      "3. Review and manage app permissions regularly:\u00a0Over time, you may forget which apps have been granted permissions. Regularly go through your device\u2019s app settings to check and adjust permissions. On most devices, you can access this under\u00a0settings >\u00a0privacy >\u00a0app permissions (specific steps vary by operating system). Revoke access for any apps that don\u2019t need it or seem suspicious.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Turn off location services when not in use:\u00a0Keep location services off when you don\u2019t need them. This reduces the chances of apps or devices tracking you passively in the background. For tasks like mapping or food delivery, turn location services on temporarily, then turn them off when you\u2019re done. For added security, avoid connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks, which can also be used to track your location indirectly.",
      "5. Use privacy-focused tools and apps: Invest in tools designed to safeguard your privacy. Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your location online and prevent unwanted tracking while browsing.\u00a0 VPNs will also protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFS AS THE LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If Allstate is indeed unlawfully collecting and selling people\u2019s location data, Attorney General Paxton is right to hold them accountable by filing a lawsuit. In an era where cybercriminals exploit every opportunity to scam individuals, companies that fail to protect customer data are unacceptable and should face consequences. Data has become the new oil, and everyone seems eager to exploit it \u2014 often at the expense of ordinary people.

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 15:31:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Here are five easy smartphone rules from the National Security Agency that you can follow to better protect your mobile device from hackers and scammers.",
    "story": [
      "Phone Free New York founder Raj Goyle joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss New York considering a ban on cellphones in classrooms",
      "Can\u2019t remember the last time you turned your phone off? Is Bluetooth always on? Do you plug into any charger you can find?",
      "Win a pair of $329 Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\u00a0Enter here, no purchase necessary!",
      "If you answered yes to any of these questions, the NSA says you\u2019re playing a crapshoot with your privacy. The National Security Agency\u2019s purpose is to listen and collect communications from satellites, cellphones and anywhere else, really.",
      "THESE MISTAKES COULD TANK YOUR CREDIT SCORE",
      "Let\u2019s take a deeper look at five smartphone rules they use that you can, too.",
      "1. Restart your phone once a week",
      "It\u2019s dead simple and absolutely worth doing. Turn off your phone, wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on. This works to combat zero-click exploits where a hacker can get in simply by sending you the right code.",
      "Heads up: A restart won\u2019t work for other types of malware. If your phone becomes infected,\u00a0you\u2019ll need to do a full factory reset.",
      "2. Disable Bluetooth when you don\u2019t need it",
      "Bluetooth works similarly to Wi-Fi and cellular networks but performs simpler tasks at shorter ranges. You don\u2019t need a cellular signal or network connection to use Bluetooth, and it doesn\u2019t use data. And like any other connection, it\u2019s not 100% safe.",
      "A driver is pictured holding an iced coffee and a mobile phone while in the car. (iStock)",
      "Hackers and scammers must be close to you to use Bluetooth to hijack your phone. But in just about any public space, you\u2019re arm\u2019s length from strangers.",
      "The NSA\u2019s advice: Turn off Bluetooth when you\u2019re not using it. It\u2019ll help battery life, too.",
      "On an iPhone, go to Settings > Bluetooth and switch it off. You can also swipe down from the top right of your screen to open the Control Center and tap the Bluetooth icon.The same steps work for Android phones. Go to Settings > Connected Devices > Connection Preferences > Bluetooth and switch it off. (Note: Steps may vary based on your phone\u2019s model. Look or search for Bluetooth if these steps don\u2019t match your phone.)",
      "On an iPhone, go to Settings > Bluetooth and switch it off. You can also swipe down from the top right of your screen to open the Control Center and tap the Bluetooth icon.",
      "The same steps work for Android phones. Go to Settings > Connected Devices > Connection Preferences > Bluetooth and switch it off. (Note: Steps may vary based on your phone\u2019s model. Look or search for Bluetooth if these steps don\u2019t match your phone.)",
      "Airplane mode also disables Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, among other things, so it works in a pinch \u2014 but you won\u2019t receive calls or texts.",
      "THE STEP I TAKE TO CLEAR MY INBOX EVERY JANUARY",
      "3. Skip public USB ports",
      "In spaces like the airport or coffee shop, hackers can use them to install malware or steal your data. Now, actual cases of juice jacking are rare in the U.S. but it\u2019s still a real threat. They happen through USB connections, so if a kiosk has actual power outlets to charge your phone using your own adapter, you\u2019re good to go.",
      "Stay away from USB ports of any size, especially when traveling overseas. USB standards are international, and foreign hackers can target USB ports in hotels or rentals to steal your data, even if you\u2019re not using a kiosk.",
      "More and more public kiosks have wireless charging pads instead of USBs. This method doesn\u2019t exchange data directly with your phone, so it\u2019s virus-free by default.",
      "If you\u2019re desperate for juice, you can use a USB connection safely \u2026 with the right cable. Pack a\u00a0charge-only cable for your trip. They\u2019re cheap and compact, and they don\u2019t allow for data transfers.",
      "A business person is seen working on a laptop. (iStock)",
      "4. Don\u2019t use public Wi-Fi",
      "It's a playground for snoopers. Public Wi-Fi is open to everyone, and every device is susceptible, whether it\u2019s your smartphone, laptop or tablet.",
      "Just because a public Wi-Fi network pops up and asks if you want to join doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s legitimate. If you\u2019re at a coffee shop or hotel, ask an employee for the specific name of their Wi-Fi network. Scammers will sometimes create networks called \"Coffee Shop\" or \"Hotel Guest\" to make you believe you\u2019re connecting to the real thing when, actually, you\u2019re not.",
      "Here\u2019s a good rule of thumb: If it requires a username and password to log in, you should only access that site from your own private network. If you do need to access sensitive sites or info on a public network, don\u2019t do it without a VPN enabled.",
      "AI ISN\u2019T GOING ANYWHERE: PROMPTS TO MAKE LIFE EASIER",
      "5. Cover your mic and camera",
      "The NSA says it\u2019s best to use a protective case that drowns out your microphone and covers your camera when you\u2019re not using it.",
      "In \"hot-miking\" attacks, hackers activate your microphone without you knowing it so they can listen into your conversations. It happens when your device has been compromised in some way, usually through malware or an app that\u2019s exploiting permissions you granted. Most folks aren\u2019t targets for attacks like this, but I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry.",
      "Start with app permissions to check what access you\u2019ve handed out:",

      "It\u2019s not just hackers to worry about.\u00a0Most of what you type, say, search and buy is being tracked in one way or another.",
      "The only unhackable layer of security is physically blocking the sound or camera feed.\u00a0There are expensive cases out there that do the job, or you can buy a\u00a0mic blocker for around $10.",
      "It slides into your headphone port to stop recording. You\u2019ll need an adapter unless your phone still has an audio jack. For a cheaper DIY option, grab your oldest corded headphones, snip them off and plug that into an adapter.",

It happens when criminals use stolen personal health information to obtain medical services or medications under another person\u2019s name. It can result in incorrect medical records being created that can include inaccurate diagnoses, allergies or treatments.",
      "And as you may have guessed, it can also result in financial repercussions, such as patients getting fraudulent claims and bills for services they did not receive. Resolving these issues with insurers and healthcare providers takes time and mental strength. And you\u2019re probably not in a hurry to see your breached healthcare provider ever again. That\u2019s normal. A study has shown that\u00a0up to 54% of patients consider switching providers after a data breach.",

      "Sensitive health information can easily be combined with personal identifiers from data brokers, creating comprehensive profiles that criminals can exploit. As a reminder, data brokers are companies that specialize in collecting, processing and selling personal information from various sources, including public records, online activities and social media.",
      "They aggregate this data to create detailed consumer profiles that can be sold to marketers, insurance companies and other entities for various purposes. The more detailed the profile, the higher the chance of identity theft and potential discrimination in employment and insurance. Employers might make hiring decisions based on perceived health risks, while insurers could deny coverage or increase premiums.",

      "2. Remove your personal data from data brokers\u2019 databases: Either by searching for your name on people search sites and requesting removals, one by one, or by using a data removal service. Data removal services automate data removal for you and let you track where exactly your data has been found and whether it was removed, not only on people search sites, which are public data brokers, but also on hidden, private databases where you can\u2019t look yourself up (and these are the worst).",
      "Once your data is removed, data removal services monitor data brokers for your data and remove it again as needed (because it has a tendency to be re-listed after a while).

      "5. Use a VPN (virtual private network) when browsing: Encrypt your online activities and mask your digital location to add an extra layer of anonymity and protection.

While you can\u2019t prevent breaches from happening, you can take steps to minimize the risks and protect your personal information. Think of it as adding locks to your digital doors: set your social media to private, use a VPN and clean up unused apps.

      "MNPS allegedly sent the Post a study showing that metal detectors can disproportionately impact students of color and instill more of a sense of fear than one of safety for some. However, Bush dismissed this reasoning as a \"bunch of bull.\"",

      "Throughout the 2024 campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to revamp the Justice Department and the FBI, accusing both of pursuing politically motivated \u201cwitch hunts\u201d against him.\u00a0Smith and former Attorney General Merrick Garland repeatedly said Trump\u2019s own actions, not political bias, resulted in the criminal prosecutions.",
      "Trump\u2019s election victory suggested that voters still support him and his vows to shake up Washington.\u00a0\u201cThe scales of justice will be rebalanced,\u201d Trump said in his inaugural address last week. \u201cThe vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.\u201d",
      "A former career Justice Department official who worked during Trump\u2019s first term and asked not to be named, citing fears of retribution, said the firings were driven by revenge but were also strategic.",
      "\u201cHe fired them out of anger and spite,\u201d the former Justice Department official said. \u201cHe is trying to intimidate other officials in an effort to get them to submit to him personally rather than to their jobs and the Constitution.\u201d",
      "A second former Justice Department official predicted that acts of retribution would continue if Kash Patel, Trump\u2019s nominee, is confirmed as FBI director.",
      "Patel, whose confirmation hearing is Thursday, has blamed career civil servants for being part of a\u00a0\u201cdeep state\u201d plot to undermine Trump\u2019s presidency. Patel published a list of 50 people in a 2023 memoir who he said were members of the \u201cexecutive branch deep state.\u201d",
      "The second former Justice Department official said: \u201cThe firings are designed not just to punish these career officials who were simply doing their jobs, but to send a chilling and sinister message to other career employees that they better not stand in the way of people like Kash Patel who have vowed to target Trump\u2019s political opponents.\u201d",
      "Multiple reassigments",
      "Last week, Justice Department officials\u00a0reassigned four senior career prosecutors\u00a0also involved in Trump investigations to a crackdown on sanctuary cities. The former officials warned that the loss of  prosecutors with decades of experience will slow federal counterterrorism, criminal and cyber investigations and potentially put the public at risk.",
      "The reassigned prosecutors were moved to a new Justice Department task force\u00a0created last week\u00a0that will investigate state or local officials who resist or fail to comply with federal immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "A third former Justice Department official said the demotions of the senior career prosecutors would weaken the department and the FBI.",
      "\u201cOnly a fool could think that introducing turmoil into \u2014 and removing expertise from \u2014 our national security mission is a good idea,\u201d said the third former official, who also requested anonymity because of concerns about retribution.",
      "George Toscas, a senior civil servant in the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division who was involved in the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s estate in Florida, in 2022, was reassigned to the sanctuary city task force last week,\u00a0NBC News reported last week.",
      "So was Eun Young Choi, a career prosecutor in the National Security Division, who helped convict Ross Ulbricht, a cryptocurrency backer who helped found Silk Road, a black market on the dark web that sold illegal drugs,\u00a0The Washington Post reported.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0promised to pardon Ulbricht, a folk hero in the libertarian and crypto communities, if they supported him.\u00a0On his first full day in office,\u00a0Trump pardoned Ulbricht and denounced the federal prosecutors who convicted him.",
      "\u201cThe scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern-day weaponization of government against me,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "The\u00a0second former Justice Department official said reassigning career prosecutors put the public at risk.",
      "\u201cThe senior career DOJ officials who have been targeted are in charge of investigating the most sensitive and complex national security threats facing the country \u2014 from active terrorist plots to Chinese cyberattacks,\u201d the former official said. \u201cThey are extraordinary public servants who have devoted their professional lives to national security. There\u2019s just no way to replace their decades of experience and leadership.\u201d",
      "Multiple Republicans in Congress, though, have said the Justice Department and the FBI need sweeping reform. Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn.,\u00a0said on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d\u00a0last month that\u00a0Patel \u201crepresents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI. ... The entire agency needs to be cleaned out.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are serious problems at the FBI,\u201d Hagerty added. \u201cThe American public knows it.\u201d",
      "Timothy Naftali, a senior research scholar at the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs and\u00a0former director of the Nixon Presidential Library,\u00a0said Trump\u2019s victory in November is a sign of the support he still enjoys from voters.",
      "Naftali said Trump and President Richard Nixon are similar in that they both tend to view the world in terms of allies or enemies. He said Trump, though, has been far more successful than Nixon at convincing Americans that all of the investigations of his conduct have been improper.",
      "Until that public perception fades, Naftali said, Trump is likely to continue to openly retaliate.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s managed to convince people that the exercise of investigative powers against Donald J. Trump is always illegitimate,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. That gives him latitude. That\u2019s the era we are living in.\u201d"

      "\u201cHe felt like the room was spinning and he was the only one and there was nobody to help him,\u201d Rahman said. \u201cThese teachers are supposed to be the mentors, the people who you look up to, and if that fails, there\u2019s nothing.\u201d",

      "Matthew Huttle, 42, was involved in a traffic stop at 4:15 p.m. by a Jasper County sheriff\u2019s deputy, authorities said in a news release. It alleged that Huttle resisted arrest and was found to have a firearm on him.",
      "\"An altercation took place between the suspect and the officer, which resulted in the officer firing his weapon and fatally wounding the suspect,\" the release said.",
      "Sheriff Patrick Williamson requested an investigation by the Indiana State Police. The deputy was placed on paid administrative leave in accordance with department policy, Williamson said.",
      "\"Our condolences go out to the family of the deceased as any loss of life is traumatic to those that were close to Mr. Huttle,\" Williamson said in a statement. \"I will release the officer's name once I have approval from the State Police Detectives.\"",

    "summary": "As Trump floods the zone in his first week, Democrats are departing from their \"resistance\" strategy in his first term and zeroing in on economic issues.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Less than 48 hours after President Donald Trump was inaugurated, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries held a closed-door meeting with Democratic lawmakers to issue a warning and a clarion call.",
      "The new administration was going to \u201cflood the zone,\u201d and Democrats couldn\u2019t afford to chase every single outrage \u2014 or nothing was going to sink in for the American people, Jeffries told them, according to a person in the room who requested anonymity to discuss the private meeting.",
      "Jeffries, D-N.Y., urged members to focus their message on the cost of living, along with border security and community safety.",
      "\u201cThe House Republican Contract Against America is an extreme plan that will not lower costs for everyday Americans,\u201d Jeffries told reporters the next day, referring to the GOP agenda and spending cuts it is weighing. \u201cIt will make our country more expensive.\u201d",
      "Burned by their failures to end the Trump era the first time, Democrats are crafting a new playbook for his second administration that departs from the noisy resistance of his first presidency. The new approach, according to more than a dozen party leaders, lawmakers and strategists, will be to zero in on pocketbook issues as they lay the groundwork for the 2026 midterm elections and beyond. And they plan to focus less on his cultural taunts and issues that don\u2019t reach the kitchen table.",
      "The strategy will test Democrats' ability to break through in a cluttered and rapidly evolving information environment. It will also clash with the wishes of some progressive members and activist groups, who want to make a firm stand against Trump\u2019s aggressive migrant deportations and his rollback of transgender rights. But postelection surveys indicate that apart from dissatisfaction with inflation, those two issues fueled Trump\u2019s win as he cast Democrats as out of touch with ordinary voters.",
      "The party is less inclined to die on either of those hills. Indeed, Democrats from swing states and districts helped Republicans pass the Laken Riley Act, a bill aimed at clamping down on undocumented immigrants who commit nonviolent crimes. And Democrats, led Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., the first openly transgender member of Congress, have parried GOP taunts over trans rights by calling them an attempt to distract voters from a hollow economic agenda.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who was in many ways the face of the first resistance to Trump, agreed with the approach.",
      "\u201cI think we have to pick our fights and not chase after every crazy squirrel,\u201d Schiff said in an interview.",
      "As the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s top Democrat, Schiff was a fixture on TV during Trump\u2019s first term as he managed the first Trump impeachment. But now, Schiff said, the resistance must evolve.",
      "\u201cThe renaming of the Gulf of Mexico and other absurdities like that we just let go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the stuff that really matters \u2014 the trade wars that are going to raise costs on people, the mass deportations that are going to raise food prices and cause suffering among huge numbers of families, the pardoning of criminals who beat police and now the focus on tax cuts for really rich people that will do nothing for working families. These are the big fights that we need to focus on.\u201d",
      "Unlike in their first defeat to Trump in 2016, this time Democrats lost the popular vote and saw their vaunted \u201cObama coalition\u201d break into pieces, with many working-class voters and Latinos fleeing to Trump. There was no Russia investigation or foreign interference operation to blame this time.",
      "Many of those voters cited inflation as a reason for throwing their support to Trump. Dissatisfied with the cost of living under President Joe Biden and nostalgic for the pre-pandemic economy, they decided to give him another chance.",
      "Democrats\u2019 mission is to win back those voters by proving that Trump has no plan to improve their livelihoods and might only make things worse.",
      "After Trump delivered his lengthy inaugural speech, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the former House speaker, issued a statement highlighting \u201cwhat he didn\u2019t mention\u201d \u2014 \u201chis promised tax cuts for the rich.\u201d",
      "Top Democrats are zeroing in on the massive party-line bill that Republicans are crafting to pass Trump\u2019s agenda, describing it as a tax cut for his wealthy friends that could be paid for by cutting safety net programs that middle-class people rely on.",
      "They point to a 50-page document circulated by the House Budget Committee, first reported by Punchbowl News, that outlines a bevy of spending cuts \u2014 including to Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and the SNAP program \u2014 to help finance its agenda for tax breaks, immigration funding and more.",
      "\u201cAs the saying goes, \u2018If you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu.\u2019 So, it\u2019s no surprise from looking at Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet of millionaires and billionaires that America\u2019s middle class is on the menu,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement responding to the document.",
      "Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, a member of the Democratic leadership team, begrudgingly admitted Trump is talented at distracting his critics by making them chase shiny objects. This time, he said, the resistance needs to focus on the GOP economic agenda.",
      "\u201cWe are going to talk every day and every week about what a rip-off this whole enterprise is,\u201d Schatz said in an interview.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that congressional Democrats have done poorly, frankly, is that we talk about one thing one week and then something else the following week,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s especially the dynamic with Trump in charge, because he\u2019s extraordinarily skillful at commanding attention. And so one of the things that we\u2019re going to make a conscious effort to do is: Whatever else is going on, our message is going to be: They are ripping you off.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Gary Peters announced Tuesday that he won\u2019t run for re-election in Michigan in 2026, creating a pivotal open-seat election next year in one of the most tightly divided swing states in the United States.",
      "Peters made the announcement in an interview with The Detroit News, where he said he wouldn\u2019t resign but won\u2019t seek re-election because he \u201cnever saw service in Congress as something you do your whole life.\u201d",
      "\u201cI always thought there would be a time that I would step aside and pass the reins for the next generation,\u201d he told the paper.",
      "\u201cI think this is pretty normal for everybody to say, I\u2019ve done a job, and I\u2019m proud of the job I did, but there are other things I want to do in my life. There are other ways that I can give back to the community.\u201d",
      "Peters also released a video and press release announcing his decision.",
      "Peters' decision will have implications for the fight for control of the Senate in two years and, potentially, for Michigan's closely watched race for governor. Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the Senate, plus the tie-breaking vice presidency. Peters' retirement in a state Donald Trump has twice won narrowly (and lost once) could add another degree of difficulty to his party's efforts to win the majority.",
      "Peters has repeatedly faced tough election fights in the competitive state. So while his race would have likely been competitive if he decided to run again, the open race only raises the likelihood of a competitive Senate election in Michigan next year, when it could be one of the top battlegrounds on the Senate map.",
      "A big field of potential candidates for Senate and governor",
      "It\u2019s unclear who might run to replace Peters from either party. To the extent people in Michigan were looking forward to 2026 elections already, much of the attention in the state has been focused right now on the wide open race for governor, since two-term Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is term-limited.",
      "Whitmer, in a statement issued by a spokesperson for her political group, Fight Like Hell, said she would not seek Peters' seat.",
      "\"Governor Whitmer is grateful for Senator Peters\u2019 service,\" the spokesperson said. \"She is proudly serving the people of Michigan as governor and is not running for this seat in the Senate.\"",
      "Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is the only major Democrat in the race for governor right now, while Michigan state Senate Republican Leader Aric Nesbitt is the only major GOP candidate in the race. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a former Democrat, left the party and is mounting an independent bid.",
      "But many potential candidates on both sides of the aisle were expected to consider running for governor. It\u2019s possible this opening could sway some of those politicians to decide to mount a Senate bid instead.",
      "On the Democratic side, possible gubernatorial contenders include Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, former U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who moved to the state a few years ago (his husband grew up in Michigan), and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, a member of the Democratic leadership in the Senate whose influence has grown in the state after a buzzy floor speech pushing back against Republicans who claimed her party wanted to indoctrinate children.",
      "And the Republican side could get crowded too \u2014 there are a number of current or former GOP members of Congress who could be strong candidates if they decide to run, and candidates for governor in 2022 who may want to try to run again.",
      "Now that the Senate race is open, it could serve as another release valve for pent-up political ambition among Michigan Democrats and Republicans.",
      "GOP Rep. John\u00a0James, for example, ran in two of the last three Senate elections in the state, though it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019d want to run again this year. A Republican Senate strategist keeping tabs on the race told NBC News they're keeping an eye specifically on James, as well as former Rep. Mike Rogers (who ran in 2024) and current Rep. Bill Huizenga.",
      "A source familiar with Buttigieg's thinking confirmed that he is \"exploring all options on how he can be helpful and continue to serve.\"",
      "\"He\u2019s honored to be mentioned for this and he\u2019s taking a serious look,\" the source added.",
      "Whether someone like Buttigieg decides to jump in could help shape the race as well.",
      "McMorrow told NBC News that she is looking at both the gubernatorial and Senate races and plans to \"have a number of conversations in the coming days about where I can do the most good for Michiganders.\u201d",
      "Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Mich., who won her second term last fall in a Grand Rapids-area district, also is looking at the Senate race, according to a source close to her.",
      "Dennis Lennox, a GOP consultant with extensive Michigan experience, noted that now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin enjoyed a relatively clear Democratic primary field in her successful bid to succeed the retiring former Sen. Debbie Stabenow.",
      "\u201cDemocrats in Michigan are institutionally stronger and clearing the field will help their eventual nominee,\u201d said Lennox, who mentioned Buttigieg as a strong candidate.",
      "Lennox went on to mention James as a potential candidate for either post and wondered if Rep. John Moolenaar or Huizenga would want to give up their House seats if James doesn\u2019t run for Senate.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t much of a Republican bench, although Michigan is one of those states where there\u2019s perennially an outside business kind of candidate who self-funds,\u201d he said, mentioning former RNC and Michigan GOP Chair Ronna McDaniel as a \u201cwild card\u201d possibility.",
      "Peters' rise in politics",
      "Peters told The Detroit News he wouldn't run for another public office in 2026 and is focused on finishing his Senate term.",
      "A former state senator, Naval Reserve officer and head of the state's lottery, Peters arrived in Washington in 2009 after defeating a GOP incumbent in an Oakland County-area House race. He won a tough re-election in 2010 amid the Republican wave that year before winning a difficult Democratic primary after redistricting threw him into a district with another incumbent.",

      "Peters holds pivotal committee posts in the Senate, on the Appropriations, Armed Services and Commerce, Science and Transportation committees. And he served two stints leading the Senate Democrats' campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Under his leadership in 2022, Democrats expanded their majority in an election cycle many had expected would be difficult for his party.",
      "Two years later, Democrats lost control of the Senate. Besides losing seats in deep-red West Virginia in 2024, Montana and Ohio, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey also lost in Pennsylvania, but Democrats kept Senate seats in other battlegrounds Trump won, including Michigan."

      "The power of President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement will face the first tests of his second term Tuesday in a pair of special primary elections in Florida.",
      "Both of Trump\u2019s preferred candidates \u2014 Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis in the 1st Congressional District and state Sen. Randy Fine in the 6th District \u2014 appear to be in strong positions, trouncing their primary opponents in fundraising and garnering support from outside groups.",
      "\"Trump\u2019s endorsement has loomed large in Florida Republican politics for most of a decade,\" said Florida consultant Jamie Miller, a former executive director of the state GOP, noting Trump's support was a crucial factor in propelling Gov. Ron DeSantis to victory in his 2018 primary.",
      "\u201cIf you have a qualified candidate who doesn\u2019t make a major mistake, that person is highly likely to win a primary,\u201d Miller added.",
      "Patronis is looking to replace former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who withdrew as Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general amid allegations of sexual misconduct in November. Gaetz announced his plans to resign after Trump had announced his plans to nominate him. Fine is vying to replace former Rep. Michael Waltz, who is now Trump's national security adviser.",
      "The GOP primary winners will be heavily favored in the special general elections in the ruby-red districts, set for April 1. Both Patronis and Fine have been looking to tout Trump\u2019s endorsement.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump told me, he said, \u2018Jimmy,\u2019 he said, \u2018You watch. When I endorse you, a lot of people are gonna think twice about getting in,\u2019\u201d Patronis said in an interview Monday, recalling a phone call in late November.",
      "Trump publicly encouraged Patronis to run, and when he launched his campaign with Trump\u2019s endorsement, Patronis said, he got calls from other potential candidates who had decided to step aside.",
      "\u201cThe same type of passion I\u2019ve got in my heart is the same passion these folks have in their heart,\u201d Patronis said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go against the president. This [is] who the president feels like can best complement him in getting his agenda across the finish line.\u201d",
      "Still, several others decided to stay in the race: Patronis is one of 10 GOP candidates who qualified for the primary ballot in the 1st District, on the Florida Panhandle. But Patronis has far outraised his rivals, and he had $711,000 in his campaign account as of Jan. 8.",
      "His closest rival, Gene Valentino, who has self-funded much of his campaign, had $29,000 in his account, according to campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.",
      "Fine, Trump\u2019s pick in the 6th District to replace Waltz, faces less opposition as just one of three Republicans who qualified for the ballot. Fine, who declined to comment on the race, had $242,000 in his account as of Jan. 8, and none of the other GOP candidates reported raising any significant funds.",
      "Patronis and Fine have also received boosts from a handful of outside groups that have launched ads on the airwaves and in voters\u2019 mailboxes. Defend American Jobs, a super PAC tied to the cryptocurrency industry, has spent a combined $700,000 on ads in both races, according to independent expenditure reports filed with the FEC.",
      "Patronis and King have leveraged their Trump endorsements, featuring photos showing them next to him prominently on their campaign websites.",
      "Patronis has also invoked Trump on the airwaves, highlighting his call with Trump in a TV ad and on the radio. Both spots refer to the attempt to assassinate Trump at a Pennsylvania rally last year, with the TV ad featuring video of the shooting. Patronis described the event as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d and said he did not discuss referring to the assassination attempt with Trump\u2019s team.",
      "Patronis and Fine also have endorsements from House GOP leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson. And if they win Tuesday\u2019s primaries, they will be in strong positions to carry the GOP-leaning districts in the special elections. Gaetz and Waltz won their re-elections last year by more than 30 points.",
      "The special elections could also help Johnson pad his slim majority in the House. But navigating that narrow majority will still be a challenge, even without Gaetz, who often battled with leadership and led the effort to oust Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as speaker.",
      "Patronis, for example, said he could butt heads with GOP leaders and Trump over government spending, pointing to his experience as Florida\u2019s chief financial officer.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t tend to necessarily be the guy who\u2019s going to blow things up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, I will not waste people\u2019s money, and I have no problem calling out absurdity.\u201d",
      "Democrats are also competing in Tuesday\u2019s primaries, although they will face uphill climbs in April.",
      "Gay Valimont, a grassroots activist focused on preventing gun violence, who lost to Gaetz in November, is the only Democrat running in the 1st District. The top Democratic fundraisers in the 6th District include Josh Weil, a teacher, and George Selmont, an attorney."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A number of Senate Republicans have problems with President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, former Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, citing pro-union stances she has taken in the past that clash with the business community.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to support her,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a senior member of the committee that will oversee her nomination, told NBC News on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m the national spokesman and lead author of the right-to-work bill. Her support for the PRO Act, which would not only oppose national right to work but would pre-empt state law on right to work \u2014 I think it\u2019s not a good thing.",
      "Follow live politics coverage",
      "\"And it\u2019d be sort of hard for me, since it\u2019s a big issue for me, to support her. So I won\u2019t support her. I think she\u2019ll lose 15 Republicans,\u201d Paul said, predicting she would win some Democrats because \u201cshe\u2019s very pro-labor.\u201d",
      "The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee hasn\u2019t scheduled a hearing yet on Chavez-DeRemer, who represented a swing district in Oregon for one term before she lost re-election to a Democrat last fall. Asked whether he has told the White House about his opposition, Paul said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to tell them.\u201d",
      "We\u2019re looking to hear from federal government workers. If you\u2019re willing to talk with us, please email us at\u00a0tips@nbcuni.com\u00a0or\u00a0contact us\u00a0through one of these methods.",
      "The stark opposition from a Republican senator who is otherwise aligned with Trump points to the challenges ahead for Chavez-DeRemer, an unorthodox GOP pick who supported the PRO Act, which would beef up labor protections for employees to collectively bargain and expand the scope of what counts as an unfair labor practice. She has also earned qualified praise from traditionally Democratic-aligned labor groups, including the AFL-CIO.",
      "For the same reasons, Chavez-DeRemer has drawn deep skepticism from the business lobby, which has had a strong relationship with Republicans for many years.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern going into a new Trump administration is the dramatic shift on labor unions, traditionally a large Democratic fundraising base,\u201d a veteran business lobbyist said. \u201cThe nominee for labor secretary has shown previous support for anti-employer rights legislation, and there is no reason to believe that she won\u2019t put people and policies in place to enact new employment regulations that restrict employer\u2019s rights.",
      "\u201cI hope I am wrong, but we could be headed into a difficult four years for public- and private-sector employees,\u201d the person added.",
      "A Trump spokesman didn\u2019t reply to a request for comment for this article.",
      "For now, at least, Democratic support is uncertain. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a champion of the labor movement who caucuses with the Democratic Party and is the top Democrat on the committee, declined to comment on her Monday.\u201cThere\u2019s a process with the hearings. We\u2019ll ask our questions, and we\u2019ll see what she has to say,\u201d Sanders said. Asked whether he\u2019s open-minded about her nomination, he said, \u201cI\u2019m open-minded about everybody.\u201d",
      "Paul isn\u2019t the only skeptical Republican. If his estimation is correct, Chavez-DeRemer would need significant Democratic support to be confirmed in the Senate, where the GOP has a 53-47 majority.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s concerning,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said when he was asked about the nomination.",
      "Johnson said he has questions for Chavez-DeRemer about the PRO Act in particular.",
      "\u201cWhy would she support that?\u201d Johnson said when he was asked what he would want to talk to Chavez-DeRemer about.",
      "Another longtime Republican who has lobbied for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in the past expressed concern and was unsure why Trump nominated Chavez-DeRemer.",
      "\u201cYeah, that came out of left field,\u201d the person said. \u201cI think, for the most part, many of Trump\u2019s nominees were defensible, but this one caught everyone off guard.\u201d",
      "Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., wouldn\u2019t say whether she\u2019s a good nominee.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t know her. I haven\u2019t met her,\u201d Hoeven said. \u201cShe\u2019s not a traditional pick for a Republican president.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a right-to-work guy,\u201d he added. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s certain fundamental principles. For folks who want to collectively bargain and unionize, that\u2019s fine. You\u2019re allowed to do that, as long as it\u2019s fair and open and all those kinds of things. But at the same time, I firmly believe in right to work. You can\u2019t be mandated to join a union or something like that. So those are some of the kind of things that we need to talk about.\u201d",
      "Paul\u2019s National Right-to-Work Act was co-sponsored by 31 Republican senators in the last Congress. It would eliminate parts of the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act that allow pacts between employers and unions requiring employees to be union members when they are hired.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Trump is \u201centitled to his Cabinet, absent extraordinary circumstances,\u201d but added that it\u2019s fair to call Chavez-DeRemer a nontraditional nominee.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest problems we\u2019ve had, for example, with trade agreements has been that organized labor is allergic to them,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s something I would want to explore.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans aren\u2019t yet weighing in.",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the chair of the powerful Finance Committee, said that he hasn\u2019t met with Chavez-DeRemer and that he has \u201cnot dived deeply into looking into\u201d the nomination.",
      "Senate HELP Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he wasn\u2019t sure when Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s hearing would be.",
      "\u201cWe did meet,\u201d he said, calling it an \u201cexcellent interview\u201d at which she \u201canswered all the questions in the right way.\u201d But he stopped short of saying he was ready to vote for her just yet.",
      "Asked about GOP concerns about her union-aligned positions, Cassidy said: \u201cShe\u2019s very committed to representing the president\u2019s viewpoint on such issues. And so I think that\u2019s where she will be.\u201d",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., said the choice of Chavez-DeRemer is consistent with his promise to be a different kind of president.",
      "\u201cThe president is shaking things up in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that was one of the mandates he had from this last election \u2014 was to discontinue business as usual.\u201d",
      "Those in the business lobby, who generally have a high degree of influence over Republican presidential administrations, have also both expressed concern over the Chavez-DeRemer pick and acknowledged they have decreasing influence over a new Trump administration that increasingly relied on right-wing populist support.",
      "That new base Trump has catered to during his first week in office sees the business community as an enemy, not a friend.",
      "There is an acknowledgment, however, that the once all-powerful business lobby has waning influence with the White House. In the past, groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce had influential voices, but Trump ran a campaign focused on a populist messaging supported by right-wing conservative influencers who not only don\u2019t align with the old guard Republican power structure but actively oppose its influence in the MAGA movement.",
      "Trump did use his 2024 campaign to try to gain the support of at least some segments of organized labor in a way that, in the past, would have been considered unheard-of from a Republican presidential candidate.",
      "The most striking example was the invitation he extended to Sean O\u2019Brien, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, to speak at the Republican National Convention in July.",
      "\u201cThe Teamsters are doing something correct if the extremes in both parties think I shouldn\u2019t be on this stage,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, calling Trump a \u201ctough S.O.B.\u201d",
      "The Teamsters leadership also approved an unprecedented $45,000 contribution to Trump's campaign efforts.",
      "O'Brien didn\u2019t formally endorse Trump at the convention, but his appearance was a signal that Trump was trying to disrupt a political norm that expects organized labor to support Democrats. It was also a sign that traditional business interests may have less influence with the new version of the Republican Party that Trump has ushered in.",
      "\u201cThere are conversations that we are trying to have, but there is no clear indication anything is getting through,\u201d the former Chamber of Commerce lobbyist said.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who is less critical of unions than other conservatives, said he likes Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s nomination and is looking forward to her hearing.",
      "\u201cMy message is: Come on, guys. Let\u2019s think about who voted for this president and got him in office. It\u2019s a lot of those union voters,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cWe need to do something for them. I think if we want to really be a working person\u2019s party, we\u2019re going to have to do something for working people.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to love everything in the PRO Act,\u201d he added. \u201cI have concerns about that package. Fine. But I think reflexively, \u2018Oh, my gosh, she\u2019s kind of close to labor! Danger, danger!\u2019 I think we\u2019ve got to get over that. But you\u2019re talking to a guy who walked the picket line.\u201d"

      "The Chinese startup DeepSeek has made waves after releasing AI models that experts say match or outperform leading American models at a fraction of the cost. The meteoric rise of the previously little-known company spooked U.S. investors Monday, wiping out almost $600 billion in the market value of American chipmaker Nvidia in the biggest drop in the nation's market history.",
      "In China, DeepSeek is being heralded as a symbol of the country\u2019s AI advancements in the face of U.S. export restrictions that Beijing says are aimed at suppressing its technological development.",

      "\u201cOur core technical roles are mostly filled by fresh graduates or those with just a year or two of work experience,\u201d he told the Chinese media outlet 36Kr in May 2023, adding that the company was looking for \u201cdown-to-earth individuals with curiosity.\u201d",
      "By 2022, High-Flyer had acquired 10,000 of Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips, according to a post that July on the Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. imposed restrictions on sales of those chips to China later that year.",
      "Liang told 36Kr that he acquired the chips mostly because of \u201ccuriosity about the boundaries of AI capabilities\u201d and that he had no particular commercial goal in mind.",
      "The stock market rout took place a week after DeepSeek\u2019s Jan. 20 release of an open-source language model called R1, which met with widespread acclaim in what venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called \u201cAI\u2019s Sputnik moment.\u201d",
      "Investors and the U.S. tech industry were further unnerved later in the week when DeepSeek published a technical report that said the model took only two months and less than $6 million to build, compared with the billions spent by leading U.S. tech companies.",
      "The surge in interest sent DeepSeek\u2019s recently released app to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store on Monday. The company later said that it was temporarily limiting user registrations \u201cdue to large-scale malicious attacks\u201d on its services, CNBC reported.",
      "New users were quick to note that R1 appeared subject to censorship around topics deemed sensitive in China, avoiding answering questions about the self-ruled democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims is part of its territory, or the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown or echoing Chinese government language. The model appears to operate without such restrictions, however, if it is used not through the DeepSeek website but on servers that host it outside mainland China.",
      "DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "The R1 model is now second only to California-based OpenAI\u2019s o1 in the artificial analysis quality index, an independent AI analysis ranking. It also beats leading models by Google, Meta and the  California-based Anthropic.",
      "Liang, who according to the China's media is about 40, has kept a relatively low profile in the country, where there has been a crackdown on the tech industry in recent years amid concerns by the ruling Chinese Communist Party that its biggest companies and executives might be getting too powerful.",

      "Democratic Sen. Gary Peters announced Tuesday that he won\u2019t run for re-election in Michigan in 2026, creating a pivotal open-seat election next year in one of the most tightly divided swing states in the United States.",
      "Peters made the announcement in an interview with The Detroit News, where he said he wouldn\u2019t resign but won\u2019t seek re-election because he \u201cnever saw service in Congress as something you do your whole life.\u201d",
      "\u201cI always thought there would be a time that I would step aside and pass the reins for the next generation,\u201d he told the paper.",
      "\u201cI think this is pretty normal for everybody to say, I\u2019ve done a job, and I\u2019m proud of the job I did, but there are other things I want to do in my life. There are other ways that I can give back to the community.\u201d",
      "Peters also released a video and press release announcing his decision.",
      "Peters' decision will have implications for the fight for control of the Senate in two years and, potentially, for Michigan's closely watched race for governor. Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the Senate, plus the tie-breaking vice presidency. Peters' retirement in a state Donald Trump has twice won narrowly (and lost once) could add another degree of difficulty to his party's efforts to win the majority.",
      "Peters has repeatedly faced tough election fights in the competitive state. So while his race would have likely been competitive if he decided to run again, the open race only raises the likelihood of a competitive Senate election in Michigan next year, when it could be one of the top battlegrounds on the Senate map.",
      "A big field of potential candidates for Senate and governor",
      "It\u2019s unclear who might run to replace Peters from either party. To the extent people in Michigan were looking forward to 2026 elections already, much of the attention in the state has been focused right now on the wide open race for governor, since two-term Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is term-limited.",
      "Whitmer, in a statement issued by a spokesperson for her political group, Fight Like Hell, said she would not seek Peters' seat.",
      "\"Governor Whitmer is grateful for Senator Peters\u2019 service,\" the spokesperson said. \"She is proudly serving the people of Michigan as governor and is not running for this seat in the Senate.\"",
      "Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is the only major Democrat in the race for governor right now, while Michigan state Senate Republican Leader Aric Nesbitt is the only major GOP candidate in the race. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a former Democrat, left the party and is mounting an independent bid.",
      "But many potential candidates on both sides of the aisle were expected to consider running for governor. It\u2019s possible this opening could sway some of those politicians to decide to mount a Senate bid instead.",
      "On the Democratic side, possible gubernatorial contenders include Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, former U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who moved to the state a few years ago (his husband grew up in Michigan), and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, a member of the Democratic leadership in the Senate whose influence has grown in the state after a buzzy floor speech pushing back against Republicans who claimed her party wanted to indoctrinate children.",
      "And the Republican side could get crowded too \u2014 there are a number of current or former GOP members of Congress who could be strong candidates if they decide to run, and candidates for governor in 2022 who may want to try to run again.",
      "Now that the Senate race is open, it could serve as another release valve for pent-up political ambition among Michigan Democrats and Republicans.",
      "GOP Rep. John\u00a0James, for example, ran in two of the last three Senate elections in the state, though it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019d want to run again this year. A Republican Senate strategist keeping tabs on the race told NBC News they're keeping an eye specifically on James, as well as former Rep. Mike Rogers (who ran in 2024) and current Rep. Bill Huizenga.",
      "A source familiar with Buttigieg's thinking confirmed that he is \"exploring all options on how he can be helpful and continue to serve.\"",
      "\"He\u2019s honored to be mentioned for this and he\u2019s taking a serious look,\" the source added.",
      "Whether someone like Buttigieg decides to jump in could help shape the race as well.",
      "McMorrow told NBC News that she is looking at both the gubernatorial and Senate races and plans to \"have a number of conversations in the coming days about where I can do the most good for Michiganders.\u201d",
      "Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Mich., who won her second term last fall in a Grand Rapids-area district, also is looking at the Senate race, according to a source close to her.",
      "Dennis Lennox, a GOP consultant with extensive Michigan experience, noted that now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin enjoyed a relatively clear Democratic primary field in her successful bid to succeed the retiring former Sen. Debbie Stabenow.",
      "\u201cDemocrats in Michigan are institutionally stronger and clearing the field will help their eventual nominee,\u201d said Lennox, who mentioned Buttigieg as a strong candidate.",
      "Lennox went on to mention James as a potential candidate for either post and wondered if Rep. John Moolenaar or Huizenga would want to give up their House seats if James doesn\u2019t run for Senate.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t much of a Republican bench, although Michigan is one of those states where there\u2019s perennially an outside business kind of candidate who self-funds,\u201d he said, mentioning former RNC and Michigan GOP Chair Ronna McDaniel as a \u201cwild card\u201d possibility.",
      "Peters' rise in politics",
      "Peters told The Detroit News he wouldn't run for another public office in 2026 and is focused on finishing his Senate term.",
      "A former state senator, Naval Reserve officer and head of the state's lottery, Peters arrived in Washington in 2009 after defeating a GOP incumbent in an Oakland County-area House race. He won a tough re-election in 2010 amid the Republican wave that year before winning a difficult Democratic primary after redistricting threw him into a district with another incumbent.",
      "He then won a campaign to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Carl Levin in 2014, earning a second term in a hard-fought race against James in 2020.",
      "Peters holds pivotal committee posts in the Senate, on the Appropriations, Armed Services and Commerce, Science and Transportation committees. And he served two stints leading the Senate Democrats' campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Under his leadership in 2022, Democrats expanded their majority in an election cycle many had expected would be difficult for his party.",
      "Two years later, Democrats lost control of the Senate. Besides losing seats in deep-red West Virginia in 2024, Montana and Ohio, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey also lost in Pennsylvania, but Democrats kept Senate seats in other battlegrounds Trump won, including Michigan."

The new approach, according to more than a dozen party leaders, lawmakers and strategists, will be to zero in on pocketbook issues as they lay the groundwork for the 2026 midterm elections and beyond. And they plan to focus less on his cultural taunts and issues that don\u2019t reach the kitchen table.",
      "The strategy will test Democrats' ability to break through in a cluttered and rapidly evolving information environment. It will also clash with the wishes of some progressive members and activist groups, who want to make a firm stand against Trump\u2019s aggressive migrant deportations and his rollback of transgender rights. But postelection surveys indicate that apart from dissatisfaction with inflation, those two issues fueled Trump\u2019s win as he cast Democrats as out of touch with ordinary voters.",
      "The party is less inclined to die on either of those hills. Indeed, Democrats from swing states and districts helped Republicans pass the Laken Riley Act, a bill aimed at clamping down on undocumented immigrants who commit nonviolent crimes. And Democrats, led Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., the first openly transgender member of Congress, have parried GOP taunts over trans rights by calling them an attempt to distract voters from a hollow economic agenda.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who was in many ways the face of the first resistance to Trump, agreed with the approach.",
      "\u201cI think we have to pick our fights and not chase after every crazy squirrel,\u201d Schiff said in an interview.",
      "As the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s top Democrat, Schiff was a fixture on TV during Trump\u2019s first term as he managed the first Trump impeachment. But now, Schiff said, the resistance must evolve.",
      "\u201cThe renaming of the Gulf of Mexico and other absurdities like that we just let go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the stuff that really matters \u2014 the trade wars that are going to raise costs on people, the mass deportations that are going to raise food prices and cause suffering among huge numbers of families, the pardoning of criminals who beat police and now the focus on tax cuts for really rich people that will do nothing for working families. These are the big fights that we need to focus on.\u201d",
      "Unlike in their first defeat to Trump in 2016, this time Democrats lost the popular vote and saw their vaunted \u201cObama coalition\u201d break into pieces, with many working-class voters and Latinos fleeing to Trump. There was no Russia investigation or foreign interference operation to blame this time.",
      "Many of those voters cited inflation as a reason for throwing their support to Trump. Dissatisfied with the cost of living under President Joe Biden and nostalgic for the pre-pandemic economy, they decided to give him another chance.",
      "Democrats\u2019 mission is to win back those voters by proving that Trump has no plan to improve their livelihoods and might only make things worse.",
      "After Trump delivered his lengthy inaugural speech, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the former House speaker, issued a statement highlighting \u201cwhat he didn\u2019t mention\u201d \u2014 \u201chis promised tax cuts for the rich.\u201d",
      "Top Democrats are zeroing in on the massive party-line bill that Republicans are crafting to pass Trump\u2019s agenda, describing it as a tax cut for his wealthy friends that could be paid for by cutting safety net programs that middle-class people rely on.",
      "They point to a 50-page document circulated by the House Budget Committee, first reported by Punchbowl News, that outlines a bevy of spending cuts \u2014 including to Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and the SNAP program \u2014 to help finance its agenda for tax breaks, immigration funding and more.",
      "\u201cAs the saying goes, \u2018If you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu.\u2019 So, it\u2019s no surprise from looking at Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet of millionaires and billionaires that America\u2019s middle class is on the menu,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement responding to the document.",
      "Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, a member of the Democratic leadership team, begrudgingly admitted Trump is talented at distracting his critics by making them chase shiny objects. This time, he said, the resistance needs to focus on the GOP economic agenda.",
      "\u201cWe are going to talk every day and every week about what a rip-off this whole enterprise is,\u201d Schatz said in an interview.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that congressional Democrats have done poorly, frankly, is that we talk about one thing one week and then something else the following week,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s especially the dynamic with Trump in charge, because he\u2019s extraordinarily skillful at commanding attention. And so one of the things that we\u2019re going to make a conscious effort to do is: Whatever else is going on, our message is going to be: They are ripping you off.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The firing of\u00a0multiple career Justice Department lawyers\u00a0involved in prosecuting Donald Trump\u00a0on Monday was designed to intimidate the Justice Department and FBI workforce and deter investigations of Trump\u2019s second administration, five former Justice Department and FBI officials told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThey are scaring people into behaving a certain way,\u201d said a former senior FBI official, who asked not to be named, citing fears of retaliation.",
      "\u201cImagine if anyone in the new administration legitimately abuses their position,\" he added. \"Is anyone in DOJ or FBI really going to investigate that now?\u201d",
      "Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert and former New York University law professor, said Trump appears to be trying to achieve two goals: punishing his perceived enemies and deterring future criminal probes.",
      "\u201cThe motive is retribution,\u201d Gillers said. \u201cAt the same time, he also warns others that they will suffer the same fate if they cross him. So a second motive is deterrence. What we have then is both revenge and behavior modification.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department, now run by an acting deputy attorney general appointed by Trump, declined to comment.",
      "Among those fired Monday were multiple career prosecutors who worked on the team of special counsel Jack Smith, who charged Trump with mishandling classified documents and interfering in the 2020 election. They include Molly Gaston, J.P. Cooney, Anne McNamara and Mary Dohrmann,\u00a0an official familiar with the matter said.",
      "Throughout the 2024 campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to revamp the Justice Department and the FBI, accusing both of pursuing politically motivated \u201cwitch hunts\u201d against him.\u00a0Smith and former Attorney General Merrick Garland repeatedly said Trump\u2019s own actions, not political bias, resulted in the criminal prosecutions.",
      "Trump\u2019s election victory suggested that voters still support him and his vows to shake up Washington.\u00a0\u201cThe scales of justice will be rebalanced,\u201d Trump said in his inaugural address last week. \u201cThe vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.\u201d",
      "A former career Justice Department official who worked during Trump\u2019s first term and asked not to be named, citing fears of retribution, said the firings were driven by revenge but were also strategic.",
      "\u201cHe fired them out of anger and spite,\u201d the former Justice Department official said. \u201cHe is trying to intimidate other officials in an effort to get them to submit to him personally rather than to their jobs and the Constitution.\u201d",
      "A second former Justice Department official predicted that acts of retribution would continue if Kash Patel, Trump\u2019s nominee, is confirmed as FBI director.",
      "Patel, whose confirmation hearing is Thursday, has blamed career civil servants for being part of a\u00a0\u201cdeep state\u201d plot to undermine Trump\u2019s presidency. Patel published a list of 50 people in a 2023 memoir who he said were members of the \u201cexecutive branch deep state.\u201d",
      "The second former Justice Department official said: \u201cThe firings are designed not just to punish these career officials who were simply doing their jobs, but to send a chilling and sinister message to other career employees that they better not stand in the way of people like Kash Patel who have vowed to target Trump\u2019s political opponents.\u201d",
      "Multiple reassigments",
      "Last week, Justice Department officials\u00a0reassigned four senior career prosecutors\u00a0also involved in Trump investigations to a crackdown on sanctuary cities. The former officials warned that the loss of  prosecutors with decades of experience will slow federal counterterrorism, criminal and cyber investigations and potentially put the public at risk.",
      "The reassigned prosecutors were moved to a new Justice Department task force\u00a0created last week\u00a0that will investigate state or local officials who resist or fail to comply with federal immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "A third former Justice Department official said the demotions of the senior career prosecutors would weaken the department and the FBI.",
      "\u201cOnly a fool could think that introducing turmoil into \u2014 and removing expertise from \u2014 our national security mission is a good idea,\u201d said the third former official, who also requested anonymity because of concerns about retribution.",
      "George Toscas, a senior civil servant in the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division who was involved in the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s estate in Florida, in 2022, was reassigned to the sanctuary city task force last week,\u00a0NBC News reported last week.",
      "So was Eun Young Choi, a career prosecutor in the National Security Division, who helped convict Ross Ulbricht, a cryptocurrency backer who helped found Silk Road, a black market on the dark web that sold illegal drugs,\u00a0The Washington Post reported.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0promised to pardon Ulbricht, a folk hero in the libertarian and crypto communities, if they supported him.\u00a0On his first full day in office,\u00a0Trump pardoned Ulbricht and denounced the federal prosecutors who convicted him.",
      "\u201cThe scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern-day weaponization of government against me,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "The\u00a0second former Justice Department official said reassigning career prosecutors put the public at risk.",
      "\u201cThe senior career DOJ officials who have been targeted are in charge of investigating the most sensitive and complex national security threats facing the country \u2014 from active terrorist plots to Chinese cyberattacks,\u201d the former official said. \u201cThey are extraordinary public servants who have devoted their professional lives to national security. There\u2019s just no way to replace their decades of experience and leadership.\u201d",
      "Multiple Republicans in Congress, though, have said the Justice Department and the FBI need sweeping reform. Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn.,\u00a0said on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d\u00a0last month that\u00a0Patel \u201crepresents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI. ... The entire agency needs to be cleaned out.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are serious problems at the FBI,\u201d Hagerty added. \u201cThe American public knows it.\u201d",
      "Timothy Naftali, a senior research scholar at the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs and\u00a0former director of the Nixon Presidential Library,\u00a0said Trump\u2019s victory in November is a sign of the support he still enjoys from voters.",
      "Naftali said Trump and President Richard Nixon are similar in that they both tend to view the world in terms of allies or enemies. He said Trump, though, has been far more successful than Nixon at convincing Americans that all of the investigations of his conduct have been improper.",
      "Until that public perception fades, Naftali said, Trump is likely to continue to openly retaliate.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s managed to convince people that the exercise of investigative powers against Donald J. Trump is always illegitimate,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. That gives him latitude. That\u2019s the era we are living in.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The power of President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement will face the first tests of his second term Tuesday in a pair of special primary elections in Florida.",
      "Both of Trump\u2019s preferred candidates \u2014 Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis in the 1st Congressional District and state Sen. Randy Fine in the 6th District \u2014 appear to be in strong positions, trouncing their primary opponents in fundraising and garnering support from outside groups.",
      "\"Trump\u2019s endorsement has loomed large in Florida Republican politics for most of a decade,\" said Florida consultant Jamie Miller, a former executive director of the state GOP, noting Trump's support was a crucial factor in propelling Gov. Ron DeSantis to victory in his 2018 primary.",
      "\u201cIf you have a qualified candidate who doesn\u2019t make a major mistake, that person is highly likely to win a primary,\u201d Miller added.",
      "Patronis is looking to replace former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who withdrew as Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general amid allegations of sexual misconduct in November. Gaetz announced his plans to resign after Trump had announced his plans to nominate him. Fine is vying to replace former Rep. Michael Waltz, who is now Trump's national security adviser.",
      "The GOP primary winners will be heavily favored in the special general elections in the ruby-red districts, set for April 1. Both Patronis and Fine have been looking to tout Trump\u2019s endorsement.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump told me, he said, \u2018Jimmy,\u2019 he said, \u2018You watch. When I endorse you, a lot of people are gonna think twice about getting in,\u2019\u201d Patronis said in an interview Monday, recalling a phone call in late November.",
      "Trump publicly encouraged Patronis to run, and when he launched his campaign with Trump\u2019s endorsement, Patronis said, he got calls from other potential candidates who had decided to step aside.",
      "\u201cThe same type of passion I\u2019ve got in my heart is the same passion these folks have in their heart,\u201d Patronis said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go against the president. This [is] who the president feels like can best complement him in getting his agenda across the finish line.\u201d",
      "Still, several others decided to stay in the race: Patronis is one of 10 GOP candidates who qualified for the primary ballot in the 1st District, on the Florida Panhandle. But Patronis has far outraised his rivals, and he had $711,000 in his campaign account as of Jan. 8.",
      "His closest rival, Gene Valentino, who has self-funded much of his campaign, had $29,000 in his account, according to campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.",
      "Fine, Trump\u2019s pick in the 6th District to replace Waltz, faces less opposition as just one of three Republicans who qualified for the ballot. Fine, who declined to comment on the race, had $242,000 in his account as of Jan. 8, and none of the other GOP candidates reported raising any significant funds.",
      "Patronis and Fine have also received boosts from a handful of outside groups that have launched ads on the airwaves and in voters\u2019 mailboxes. Defend American Jobs, a super PAC tied to the cryptocurrency industry, has spent a combined $700,000 on ads in both races, according to independent expenditure reports filed with the FEC.",
      "Patronis and King have leveraged their Trump endorsements, featuring photos showing them next to him prominently on their campaign websites.",
      "Patronis has also invoked Trump on the airwaves, highlighting his call with Trump in a TV ad and on the radio. Both spots refer to the attempt to assassinate Trump at a Pennsylvania rally last year, with the TV ad featuring video of the shooting. Patronis described the event as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d and said he did not discuss referring to the assassination attempt with Trump\u2019s team.",
      "Patronis and Fine also have endorsements from House GOP leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson. And if they win Tuesday\u2019s primaries, they will be in strong positions to carry the GOP-leaning districts in the special elections. Gaetz and Waltz won their re-elections last year by more than 30 points.",
      "The special elections could also help Johnson pad his slim majority in the House. But navigating that narrow majority will still be a challenge, even without Gaetz, who often battled with leadership and led the effort to oust Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as speaker.",
      "Patronis, for example, said he could butt heads with GOP leaders and Trump over government spending, pointing to his experience as Florida\u2019s chief financial officer.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t tend to necessarily be the guy who\u2019s going to blow things up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, I will not waste people\u2019s money, and I have no problem calling out absurdity.\u201d",
      "Democrats are also competing in Tuesday\u2019s primaries, although they will face uphill climbs in April.",
      "Gay Valimont, a grassroots activist focused on preventing gun violence, who lost to Gaetz in November, is the only Democrat running in the 1st District. The top Democratic fundraisers in the 6th District include Josh Weil, a teacher, and George Selmont, an attorney."

    "summary": "Large school districts across the U.S. have vowed to try to protect undocumented immigrant students and their families from Trump's mass deportation push.",
    "story": [
      "At least eight large public school districts across the United States have vowed in recent days to try to protect undocumented immigrant students and their families from President Donald Trump's mass deportation push.",
      "The Trump administration has removed restrictions that prevented Immigration and Customs Enforcement from conducting raids at so-called sensitive locations, including schools (as well as houses of worship and hospitals).",
      "All children in the United States, according to the Education Department, are entitled to a public education, regardless of their \u201cimmigration status,\u201d allowing public school districts to largely avoid asking about or keeping records of their pupils\u2019 standing with immigration laws.",
      "But Trump\u2019s latest actions to roll back sensitive locations has led to increased fears among teachers and families, whose school districts are now trying to somehow soften the blows that could come from the changes in policy.",
      "That has been the case especially in big, blue-leaning cities with large populations of undocumented immigrants that already have sanctuary policies in effect \u2014 laws that seek to prevent or limit local officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities as part of broader efforts to make undocumented immigrants feel safe.",
      "A number of large public school districts in those cities have pledged to complicate the efforts by either muddling cooperation with or refusing to report information to federal immigration authorities and by making it harder for authorities to enter school grounds.",
      "On the more forceful end are Chicago and Denver, whose large public school districts have issued guidance in recent weeks that urges officials to prevent immigration officials from entering school grounds or to set high bars for entry.",
      "In a statement last week, Chicago Public Schools said that under the city\u2019s sanctuary city laws \u2014 known as its Welcoming City Ordinance \u2014 \u201cICE agents are not permitted access to CPS facilities unless they provide their credentials, the reason they are requesting access, and a criminal judicial warrant signed by a federal judge.\u201d",
      "\u201cCPS will not admit ICE agents based upon an administrative warrant, an ICE detainer, or other document issued by an agency enforcing civil immigration law,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Chicago Public Schools added in the statement that \u201cwhile the District understands there is an executive order to rescind language about \u2018sensitive locations,\u2019 including schools,\u201d district officials would refuse to \u201cshare private\u201d information with ICE.",
      "Denver Public Schools Superintendent\u00a0Alex Marrero issued specific guidance this month that advised school officials to refuse entry to government officials who arrive at school buildings who do not have \u201cbusiness\u201d or an \u201cappointment\u201d at the school.",
      "\u201cIf a government official arrives at your school requesting information or entry and they are not an individual who has an appointment or business with anyone at the school, do not allow entry,\u201d Marrero\u2019s guidance said.",
      "Officials are directed to then place the school on a secure lockdown procedure and communicate with the government officials over the intercom. The guidance said that school staff members, in situations when the government officials have already entered the building, must make sure they stay in the front office and then must place the school on lockdown.",
      "School officials are directed to ask for a warrant or a court order. Whether one is provided or not, the government agents are to be directed to the district\u2019s lawyers, according to the guidance.",
      "The guidance, however, also directs school officials to \u201cnot physically impede, interfere with or obstruct a government official in performing their duties.\u201d",
      "While the guidance was issued before Trump rolled back sensitive location procedures, Marrero said in a second statement Friday that \"the guidance was developed with\" that move \"in mind.\"",
      "Denver Public Schools spokesperson Scott Pribble said in an interview Monday that the posture with ICE agents, however, was \u201creally no different than what we do with anybody who shows up at a school door \u2014 we make sure that they have an appointment or they have school business, and if they don\u2019t, we keep them outside.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing the same thing with any government official that shows up,\u201d Pribble said.",
      "Some of the largest school districts in New York, including New York City Public Schools and several districts in Westchester County, have circulated guidance in recent days from Gov. Kathy Hochul and state Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, that directs school officials to \u201cnot allow officers inside school property to access a student except to address an imminent safety situation or where required by law due to a judicial warrant or order.\u201d",
      "Responding to questions from NBC News about the cities' approaches, a White House spokesperson wrote in an email, \"By ending the absurd policy of exempting many locations from enforcement of the law \u2014 and giving criminal illegal aliens places to hide and avoid arrest \u2014 this action empowers the brave men and women in CBP and ICE to enforce our immigration laws and make our country safer; it is NOT a directive to go into schools and churches.\"",
      "The spokesperson said that \"secondary supervisor approval is also needed before any action can be taken in locations such as a church or school,\" adding that \"we expect these situations to be extremely rare.\"",
      "Asked whether any immigration raids had occurred on any public school grounds since Trump took office, the spokesperson said that \"no enforcement operations have occurred at schools or churches.\"",
      "As of Monday evening, there had not been any public reports of any immigration raids on public school grounds. Chicago Public Schools initially claimed Friday that immigration agents went to a school. However, it quickly emerged that the agents were actually with the Secret Service, not ICE, as district officials initially said, and they were investigating a threat over the TikTok ban \u2014 not an immigration matter.",
      "Viridiana Carrizales, a co-founder of ImmSchools, a nonprofit organization that trains schools in student rights and how to navigate encounters with immigration officials, said her team has received over 100 inquiries from schools across the country seeking guidance on how to deal with the Trump administration's change to the sensitive locations policy.",
      "\u201cIt is not a scenario of if; we know that immigration will come to our schools,\u201d Carrizales said. \u201cSo there\u2019s been a lot of inquiries and a lot of requests from school districts.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, guidance within other large districts in the United States focused more specifically on reminding school officials that they are not obligated to provide any requested information about their students \u2014 although some ultimately indicated they would cooperate with ICE agents who arrive at public schools.",
      "In response to questions from NBC News, Monique Braxton, a spokesperson for the School District of Philadelphia, shared a guidance document Monday that had been sent to school leaders to be \u201cfollowed if an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent requests access to a school building and asks to detain or interview a student for immigration enforcement purposes.\u201d",
      "The guidance directed school officials in those situations to notify district lawyers of the situations, obtain documentation from the agents, \u201cwait for further direction\u201d from the school district\u2019s attorneys and formulate school crisis response plans with the district\u2019s Office of Prevention and Intervention.",
      "The plan says school officials must not provide any information about a student\u2019s family or immigration status unless directed to by district lawyers.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, School District of Philadelphia Superintendent Tony B. Watlington Sr. said, \u201cThe District will comply with required laws, and school leaders have been provided guidance about how to protect our immigrant students\u2019 rights,\u201d adding that he sought to \u201creaffirm the School District of Philadelphia\u2019s commitment to creating safe, welcoming spaces for our students and families.\"",
      "Recent guidance issued by the Salt Lake City School District said the district would refuse to share information regarding any student\u2019s immigration status with federal agents.",
      "Meanwhile, the superintendent of the Canutillo Independent School District, a public school district in El Paso, Texas, said in a statement on the district\u2019s website, titled \u201cSafe Haven,\u201d that the district \u201cwill continue its strong partnership with ICE and other law enforcement agencies\u201d while expressing \u201cconcerns about how changes in immigration policy could ripple through communities like ours.\u201d",
      "Superintendent Pedro Galaviz said in a statement over the weekend that partnerships with ICE \u201chave been instrumental in maintaining the safety and security of our campuses\u201d but that \u201cour commitment to safety will never come at the expense of our students\u2019 rights or their access to effective teaching and learning.\u201d",
      "\u201cRegardless of their circumstances, we are committed to providing stability, reassurance and support,\u201d he added."

      "After winning \u201cSurvivor\u2019s\u201d 16th season, she went on to place second in the all-returners season \u201cHeroes vs. Villains.\u201d She played again a decade later on Season 40, \u201cWinners at War,\u201d and solidified her status as reality TV royalty in recent years with appearances on \u201cThe Traitors\u201d and now, \u201cDeal or No Deal Island.\u201d",
      "Some of the archetypes that have been ascribed to her throughout her time on TV, which started when she was just 23 on \"Survivor: Cook Islands,\" include: the flirt, a villain, a manipulator and more.",
      "\"I think the Black Widow has served me very well. It's like a persona of its own,\" Shallow, now 42, tells TODAY.com. \"People see me as the Black Widow, and I think it helps people to characterize me. To kind of lock in and understand me, quote unquote, in a way that simplifies me for people and lets them feel like they know me.\"",
      "But, she adds, \"It's not all of me.\"",
      "\"SURVIVOR: MICRONESIA\" ALSO HAPPENS to be the last time Shallow played a reality TV game with newbies to the genre.",

      "The game involves contestants living on a remote destination known simply as the \"Banker's Island.\" Through a series of challenges, contestants hunt for cases. Having the highest value cases lets that person pick who has the face the Banker in a traditional game of \"Deal or No Deal.\" If that person makes an unfavorable deal, they are eliminated. If they make a good deal, they pick who goes home next.",
      "If it sounds confusing, you're not alone. Shallow describes it as a \"game show within a game show\" \u2014 only with the \"goofiest name.\"",
      "\"Once you get past how silly the name of the show sounds, and you invest yourself in watching it, it's really fun,\" she says. \"It's different to anything I've ever done, and I've done a lot of these games.\"",
      "On the show, she's competing against 11 reality TV newcomers, plus two veterans: David Genat of \"Australian Survivor\" and Will Kirby of \"Big Brother.\"",
      "Shallow describes Genat as her \"male foil,\" citing their similar gameplay and an \"instant connection and respect for each other.\" In essence, she and Genat are playing their own game, from opposite ends of the \"Deal or No Deal Island\" beach.",
      "She's also formed connections with newbies like Phillip Solomon and Dickson Wong. Unlike past shows, Shallow says she's functioning like a coach.",
      "\"Like, 'Let's work together. Let me support you. I'm going to help you see what you're not seeing and just make some moves that might be harder for you to make emotionally,'\" she says. \"I have that experience of doing that, and I can see this as a game rather than as like, real life.",
      "\"Phillip was like, 'People's families. I'm thinking about their families.' I\u2019m like, \u2018No, we\u2019re not doing that right now. Set that aside,'\" Shallow adds. \"We have 10 minutes to get our hair done and makeup done and come up with a strategy to get someone out of this game who's not going to take you out or me out.\"",
      "SHALLOW COMES BY HER ADVICE honestly. Not only is she a life coach by trade, she had a similar experience after her first few bouts on \"Survivor\" in her 20s.",
      "\"There's like a pre-show Parvati, a naive Parvati that played the first few seasons of 'Survivor' when I was very young,\" she says. \"Then I had a good chunk of time, maybe a solid decade, where I stepped out of reality television, and I had a whole life.\"",
      "She got married, welcomed a daughter, Ama, in 2018, got divorced, and in between, essentially figured out \"how to make life work for me,\" she says.",
      "Before that, she says got \"sucked in.\"",
      "\"This label that I got as the Black Widow, this man eater... this person who was willing to betray her friends \u2014\u00a0that stuck with me for a long time and really informed the choices that I made, and I made a big mess of my life from that,\" she says.",
      "That experience, and how she \"climbed out of it,\" is documented in her upcoming memoir, \"Nice Girls Don\u2019t Win: How I Burned It All Down to Claim My Power,\" which publishes July 8.",
      "Shallow says the book's alternate title was \"Torched,\" a play on the \"Survivor\" torches which, if snuffed, mark elimination from the game. Her editors thought it might be too much. But according to Shallow herself, \"the book is intense,\" starting from the story of her childhood.",
      "\"I grew up in a new age, sort of spiritual commune that was run a powerful and controlling guru,\" Shallow says. \"That's why I have a Hindu name, because she was naming the kids.\"",
      "From there, it chronicles her reality TV debut and her experience learning to reject expectations.",
      "\"The book is really a journey of claiming my power, going from being a people-pleaser, wanting to be liked, adapting myself to whatever I thought other people wanted me to be, to then burning all of that down, all of the ways I was trying to fit into society's expectations of me as a woman, as a girl, as a wife, as a mother,\" she says. \"I was like, 'I don't need to do that anymore.'\"",
      "She cites using different \"healing modalities\" over a period of about four years, including about two-and-a-half years of writing the memoir.",
      "\"I was like, 'I need to find a way to make healthy choices because I want to have healthy relationships. I want to build a life that I love that works for me,'\" she says.",
      "Coming out on the other side, she's \"saying yes to these big adventures,\" including more reality TV appearances. She says her season of \"The Traitors,\" which aired in 2024, was a \"test,\" to see if she could truly step back into a game setting and not lose herself in the process.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be the Black Widow when it serves me to be the Black Widow ... and then I'll also be like a really caretaking mom when it serves me to be that.\"",
      "Parvati Shallow",
      "\"It was a risk,\" she says. \"But when I came home, I was like, 'Oh, yeah. I can do it. I'm OK.'\"",
      "Now, she says the Black Widow role is less of an identity and more of a costume.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be the Black Widow when it serves me to be the Black Widow. I\u2019ll be the villain when it serves me to be the villain.\"",
      "\"I can step into it,\" she says. \"Just like putting on a pearly headband. I now have that power to put on the costume and take off the costume, whereas in the past, people just put it on me, and I didn't have any control over that.\"",
      "\"I'll be the Black Widow when it serves me to be the Black Widow. I'll be the villain when it serves me to be the villain,\" she adds. \"And then I'll also be like a really caretaking mom when it serves me to be that.\"",

      "\"That's it for me. This book is closed on 'Survivor,'\" she says. \"So if people want to see me play 'Survivor,' this is your last opportunity.\"",
      "She adds that she \"wouldn't do 'Survivor 50,'\" the upcoming landmark 50th season of the show. The milestone season will reportedly feature returning cast members and start filming in the spring of 2025.",
      "\"40 ('Winners at War') was not the best experience for me as far as like making alliances and being able to play,\" Shallow says. \"I don't think the new era of 'Survivor' players wants to play with me. So I'm like, 'I can't play a game if no one wants to play with me.' I just don't even want to put myself in that situation.\"",

      "\"(Cirie) and I were in this tightest alliance in that game. And then there was this twist where we got surprised by it being a final two rather than a final three,\" Shallow says. \"So it was really interesting to see her there. I was like, 'Are we going to have the same dynamic as we had in 'Micronesia,' or is it going to be different?'\"",
      "\"It was really fun playing with her,\" Shallow says.",
      "With \"Deal or No Deal Island\" and \"Australian Survivor\" having already been filmed, now, Shallow gets to watch the final cuts, a process she says is \"more fun\" compared to the beginning of her reality TV career.",

      "Adding in that same interview, \u201cIt's possible that maybe it would still be going on. My life was so great in so many ways ... beautiful girlfriend, beautiful wife, beautiful everything. Life was just a bowl of cherries.\u201d",
      "In 1993, he and Maples welcomed their first and only child together, daughter Tiffany, and were wed at the Plaza Hotel just two months later.",

      "\u201cAnything from the past I\u2019ve forgiven,\u201d Maples said when looking back on their split during a 2024 interview with The Standard. \u201cThat is a conversation that Donald and I have had: forgiving each other.

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 14:58:14 GMT",
    "summary": "Will Ferrell has a lot of fun with his wife, Viveca Paulin, and their three sons: Magnus, 20, Mattias, 18, and Axel, 15. Here are 9 stories about his parenting.",
    "story": [
      "In his latest movie, \u201cYou\u2019re Cordially Invited\u201d with Reese Witherspoon, comedian and actor Will Ferrell plays an overly involved father of the bride. In real life, he is the father of three sons.",
      "In both instances, he has more than a few dad jokes up his sleeve.",
      "Ferrell seems to greatly enjoy tormenting his wife, Viveca Paulin, and their three sons: Magnus, 20, Mattias, 18, and Axel, 15. And they don't seem to mind ... or at least they've grown accustomed to it over the years.",
      "Recently, Ferrell dressed up as a disgruntled Buddy the Elf for a Philadelphia Flyers-Los Angeles Kings hockey game.",
      "Or perhaps you've seen the indelible image of Ferrell dressed as a medieval lord to upstage his son for prom photos.",
      "There was that time Ferrell showed up at a fraternity party at the University of Southern California (where his son was a sophomore at the time) as the guest DJ, clapping along to the \u201cRocky III\u201d classic \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d by Survivor and songs by Jay-Z and Ye.",
      "And of course, Ferrell perfected work-life balance way back in 2013 when he brought his ... ahem ... casually dressed kids on stage to announce some of the biggest Emmy Award winners of the night.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith dropped out at the last second and they called me literally 45 minutes ago and I couldn\u2019t find child care, OK?\u201d Ferrell told the audience at the time. \u201cWe had a soccer game, there was a neighbor\u2019s birthday party, a nut allergy, I didn\u2019t have time to do my hair. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s great to be here.\u201d",
      "Here are more of Ferrell's thoughts on the parenting journey.",
      "1. Will Ferrell on discipline",
      "While visiting \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in 2015, Ferrell, dressed as Little Debbie of snack cake fame, told Jimmy Fallon that he only disciplines his sons as Little Debbie.",
      "\u201cSo if I come around the corner dressed like this, they know it\u2019s business,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cMy wife will say, \u2018Don\u2019t make Dad change into Little Debbie!\u2019\u201d",
      "2. Will Ferrell on gentle parenting",
      "\"As a parent of three boys, it's a lot of chaos. And all parenting rules go completely out the window,\" Ferrell told Jennifer Anniston during a 2020 interview for \"The Ellen Show.\"",
      "He joked that within five minutes, he went from saying, \"'I'm sorry your feelings are hurt'\" to \"'Get upstairs now and brush your teeth! Shut up! I don't care. Why? Because I said so!'\"",
      "Ferrell added that parenting boys is \"like running a small correctional facility.\"",
      "3. Will Ferrell on encouraging humor",
      "In a 2018 interview with Parade, Ferrell said that his kids are each \"funny in their own ways.\"",
      "For example, when he was a freshman in high school, Magnus borrowed a friend's glasses and put on a serious look for his yearbook photo. He was worried that he would get in trouble, but Ferrell said, \"\u2018No, you\u2019ve got to do it every year! Fantastic!\u2019\"",
      "Ferrell added, \"It\u2019s fun to see them make their friends laugh. Very similar to me, they\u2019re good kids at school and yet they like to try to be funny.\"",
      "4. Will Ferrell on connection",
      "As a father, Ferrell values quality, not quantity.",
      "Back in 2008, he told People, \u201cFor me, talk to your children, at least once a week. If you\u2019ve got time, do it two or three times a week, but otherwise, I find the times where I let weeks and weeks go by without talking to my children. That adds up.\u201d",
      "Ferrell has seemingly kept that distance from his children through the years.",
      "While promoting their 2017 movie, \"The House,\" Ferrell sat down with co-star Amy Poehler to talk about parenting. Poehler asked why parents have to be their kids' best friend these days.",
      "Ferrell deadpanned, \"I know I'm not my kids' best friend. Not by a long shot.\"",
      "5. Will Ferrell on playdates",
      "When visiting \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\" in 2018, Ferrell schooled Corden and a very pregnant Eva Longoria about the long-term effect of boys' bathroom habits.",
      "\"It continues on, the issue,\" he said. \"Peeing ... in a stranger way.\"",
      "Because his wife is Swedish, Ferrell and his family visit the Swedish countryside every summer. When they are outside playing soccer, there's no bathroom nearby, so the boys \"pee out in nature.\"",
      "Unfortunately, though, that habit has continued at the Ferrell home back in the U.S.",
      "\"There's been many a playdate where the scared mother who's visiting us with their child leave immediately because our children just decided to pee in the backyard \u2014 and have convinced them to pee in the backyard.\"",
      "6. Will Farrell on coaching",
      "Ferrell's boys played with the American Youth Soccer Organization, which requires parents to earn \"volunteer points\" by refereeing, Ferrell said on \"The Ellen Show\" in 2020.",
      "He generally makes it through half of the game before one of the kids on the opposing team asks if he's \"Buddy the Elf,\" his character in the hit holiday movie \"Elf.\" Ferrell then uses the distraction to give his kids a leg up on the competition.",
      "But that isn't the only mark Ferrell has made on youth soccer.",
      "According to The Hollywood Reporter, visual effects artist Justin\u00a0Blaustein, whose son played with Ferrell's son, said that the comedian \"often showed up for practice in crazy Hawaiian print shirts, long shorts, black socks and a 10-gallon cowboy hat.\"",
      "7. Will Farrell on holidays",
      "Ferrell's son Magnus has said that Easter in their household has been ... interesting.",
      "On the \"Lightweights Podcast with Joe Vulpis,\" Magnus shared a story about his mother waking him up to look in the backyard where there was \"a guy in an Easter Bunny costume, and he's just kind of trotting around, kind of bizarre, and he's making this weird face and he's singing this Easter Bunny song.\"",
      "Magnus added that his father \"is someone who has no shame. No shame. It feels like social anxiety is afraid of him.\"",
      "At Christmas, Ferrell plays the Swedish Santa, Tomten, for their annual Christmas party. He gives a present to each child ... but only if they earn it. If the kids are too nervous to perform, Tomten makes them do five push-ups.",
      "And at Halloween, the Ferrell family has a standing tradition: Ferrell will wear whatever costume his family chooses for him, according to People.",
      "One year, he was a poop emoji.",
      "8. Will Ferrell on supporting his kids",
      "Ferrell is always there for his kids with more cowbell.",
      "9. Will Ferrell on the biggest lesson he's learned as a parent",
      "In a video interview from 2023, the Wall Street Journal asked Ferrell a question we all want to know the answer to: \"What's the one lesson you've learned as a parent?\"",
      "\"Being a parent is a huge responsibility,\" Ferrell began. \"You learn a lot of lessons, but the overriding lesson I've learned is that I hate children.\""

These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloane with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

    "summary": "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni\u2019s legal case has a trial date. After the \"It Ends With Us\" stars sued one another, they will head to trial in March 2026.",
    "story": [
      "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni\u2019s legal case has a trial date.",
      "On Jan. 27, \u00a0Judge Lewis J. Liman confirmed that Lively v. Wayfarer Studios LLC et al. will address both of the stars\u2019 lawsuits in a trial set for March 9, 2026 in New York.",
      "According to the court documents obtained by NBC News, Judge Liman also stated that the pre-trial conference originally scheduled for Feb. 12, 2025 will now be held on Feb. 3. During this conference, both parties will address Lively\u2019s letter motion regarding pre-trial \u201cpublicity and attorney conduct.\u201d",
      "NBC News obtained a letter from Lively\u2019s team to the judge filed Jan. 27 that requested a conference at the earliest convenience. In it, Lively\u2019s team asks for a gag order preventing Baldoni\u2019s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, from sharing \u201cinflammatory content to tabloid media outlets that contains multiple false and defamatory statements and character attacks against Ms. Lively.\u201d Her team also aims to halt the website Freeman previously said Baldoni's legal team would create \u201cto release strategically selected documents and communications between Ms. Lively and Mr. Baldoni.\u201d Lively\u2019s team says the site \u201cwill be incomplete, biased, and prejudicial by design.\u201d",
      "NBC News and TODAY.com have reached out to both Lively and Baldoni\u2019s legal teams for comment regarding the trial date.",
      "The request came after Freeman released 10-minute behind-the-scenes footage\u00a0of Lively and Baldoni filming a slow-dancing scene in an attempt to refute Lively's claims that Baldoni acted inappropriate on set.",
      "In a statement to NBC News on Jan. 21, Lively\u2019s legal team said that the video showed \u201cBaldoni repeatedly leaning in toward Ms. Lively, attempting to kiss her, kissing her forehead, rubbing his face and mouth against her neck, flicking her lip with his thumb, caressing her, telling her how good she smells, and talking with her out of character.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery moment of this was improvised by Mr. Baldoni with no discussion or consent in advance, and no intimacy coordinator present.\u00a0Mr. Baldoni was not only Ms. Lively\u2019s co-star, but the director, the head of studio and Ms. Lively\u2019s boss,\u201d the statement continued, adding that the footage shows her \u201cleaning away and repeatedly asking for the characters to just talk. Any woman who has been inappropriately touched in the workplace will recognize Ms. Lively\u2019s discomfort.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey will recognize her attempts at levity to try to deflect the unwanted touching. No woman should have to take defensive measures to avoid being touched by their employer without their consent,\u201d the statement continued. Attorneys for Lively said that the video being released to the media instead of being used as evidence in court was \u201canother example of an unethical attempt to manipulate the public\u201d and was \u201ca continuation of their harassment and retaliatory campaign.\u201d",
      "Additionally,\u00a0Baldoni\u2019s attorney, Freeman, told NBC in a statement shared Jan. 25: \u201cThe irony is not lost on anyone that Ms. Lively is so petrified of the truth that she has moved to gag it.\u201d",
      "Freeman added in part, \u201cWhen you accuse innocent individuals of something so disturbing as sexual harassment without thinking of the destruction it would cause to not only them, but the entire domestic violence community, this is where accountability for such mean spirited actions must be taken.\u201d",
      "Freeman added that he and his team will always respect the court. \u201cHowever, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts. All we want is for people to see the actual text messages that directly contradict her allegations, video footage that clearly shows there was no sexual harassment and all the other powerful evidence that directly contradicts any false allegations of sexual harassment and subsequent smear campaign. It seems that in a time of universal deceit,\u00a0telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\u201d",
      "In December, Lively, who co-starred and was a producer on \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d filed a\u00a0sexual harassment complaint\u00a0against Baldoni. Baldoni directed the movie and portrayed Lively\u2019s character\u2019s love interest, as well. Weeks later, Lively filed a\u00a0lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, Baldoni\u2019s publicist Jennifer Abel, crisis publicist Melissa Nathan and others connected to Baldoni and the film alleging\u00a0sexual harassment and\u00a0a smear campaign against her, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "Baldoni, on his end, sued Lively, her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and other defendants for $400 million. The \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d star accused them of defamation and other contractual claims, according to court documents obtained by NBC News."

    "summary": "Miranda Lambert talks to TODAY.com about her album \"Postcards from Texas,\" husband Brendan McLoughlin and love of \"Law & Order: SVU\" as part of our \"8 before 8\" series.",
    "story": [
      "After two decades of releasing chart-topping hits, Miranda Lambert has certainly earned the right to be called a country superstar. Now, her icon status has officially been solidified.",
      "At the\u00a02024 People\u2019s Choice Country Awards, the singer received the Country Icon Award, an accolade that came hot on the heels of the release of her 10th studio album.",
      "Aptly named \"Postcards from Texas,\" it's the first album Lambert has made in Texas since she was 18 years old.",
      "\"It felt really full circle,\" she said of the experience while talking with TODAY's Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager in September 2024.",
      "While reflecting on her Country Icon Award, the singer, now 41, said it feels \"crazy\" to think that she's an icon at this point in her life.",
      "\u201cI feel like some days I\u2019m just getting started in some ways. So to already have an icon status, it means the world. But it\u2019s also like, \u2018All right, well I got to uphold this. So I got to keep going,'\u201d she said.",
      "Before appearing on TODAY's fourth hour at that time, Lambert sat down with TODAY.com to answer eight questions before 8 a.m. in\u00a0our original video series \u201c8 Before 8.\u201d",
      "From personal to professional questions, Lambert didn't hold back in her responses. She dished on country icons who inspire her, her favorite tattoo and her new album. Plus, she assessed husband Brendan McLoughlin's songwriting abilities.",
      "How did you come up with the name of your album 'Postcards from Texas'?",
      "The name \"Postcards from Texas\" kind of felt right for the record because there are so many influences on this record that have sort of made me who I am as an artist musically. And I felt like each was a little snapshot of the last 20 years of inspiration.",
      "What was the inspiration for your new song 'Wranglers'?",
      "My new song \"Wranglers\" was written by my good friend Audra Mae, and I think the inspiration was just life and girl talk. We were talking about experiences we had had, and we were writing songs and drinking tequila.",
      "And then a month later she sent me \"Wranglers,\" and she was like, \"I took our stories and I wrote them. Hope you don\u2019t mind.\" So I just love it. It\u2019s like \u2014 it really reminds me of something I would've put on some of my earlier records.",
      "What music icons have inspired you over the years?",
      "So many people have inspired me, but country, specifically. The obvious ones: Dolly (Parton) and Reba (McEntire) because they are our queens, Loretta Lynn. But on this record, specifically, I feel like George Strait had a lot of influence for me. We call him the king in Texas for a reason.",
      "\u2018Wranglers\u2019 is a total revenge anthem. What\u2019s the wildest thing you\u2019ve done to get revenge on an ex?",
      "I feel like anything that I\u2019ve ever done for revenge, I\u2019ve written in a song. So if you want the answers, you\u2019ll have to listen to the records.",
      "Describe the process of writing 'Dammit Randy' with your husband.",
      "I did write a song with my husband called \"Dammit Randy\" on this record. I had my husband writing songs here in 2020 when we were all home and bored, and he actually turned out to be pretty good. He is a retired NYPD officer, so songwriting is not his (thing). Now, he has it on his resume because he\u2019s really proud.",
      "We were kind of wrapping up songs for this record, and my friend Jon Randall picked up a guitar and that usually means we\u2019re going to write a song. And Brendan was watching football and kind of kept popping lines in. And so I was like, \"If you\u2019re going to do this, we\u2019re not going to watch the game and write songs. You got to pick a side.\" And so, he ended up writing some of my favorite lines in the song.",
      "You got married after 3 months of dating. How did you know your husband was the one?",
      "You know, my husband\u2019s my person, and it\u2019s taken a journey to get there and figure that out. But I\u2019m also a person that really believes in love and taking a risk. And if you don\u2019t, you know, I know that loving big can also mean hurting big. But to me, it\u2019s definitely worth it.",
      "This is your 10th studio album. What are 10 things you can\u2019t live without?",
      "Ten things I can\u2019t live without: Dogs, dogs, country music, my husband. Not in that order. I should have probably put him before the dogs, but he would expect nothing less. Tito's and Cheetos and girl time. Can\u2019t live without girl time. And cowboy boots and Texas Longhorns.",
      "Rapid-fire round:",
      "Probably my favorite tattoo is my guns and wings on my left arm. It\u2019s my logo, and it was my first big tattoo, and I got it when my record \"Kerosene\" went gold. So it definitely means something to me.",
      "My favorite recipe from my cookbook is probably my mom\u2019s meatloaf because it\u2019s famous. Well, she calls it famous, so, so do we.",
      "Hmm, I loved the (Las) Vegas residency so much. It was such a different way of doing what I do versus being on the road for 20 years. But it did make me miss the road. So I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, I think having a balance of a residency and the road was kind of the perfect storm.",
      "Oh, man, I can\u2019t choose between horses or dogs. It\u2019s just impossible. I\u2019ll have to take a shot.",

      "In the first installation, \"Fourth Wing,\" our heroine is thrust into the cutthroat world of Basgiath, a fantasy war college, forced to give up her ambitions of recording history and instead, learn to ride a dragon. So far the romantasy series (\"romance\" plus \"fantasy,\" for the uninitiated) has seen Violet handle a brutal year at school, a burgeoning rebellion and plenty of relationship drama.",

Detailing how Violet was able to survive in the world of dragons and war, relying on her wits and ability to find alternate paths to success, allowed Yarros to draw parallels to how she lives day-to-day.",

You just have to do it a little differently,\u2019\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI can do everything that other writers can. I just have to do it differently.

      "\"Fourth Wing,\" which came out in April 2023, propelled Yarros to the New York Times bestseller list. As of this writing, \"Fourth Wing\" is No. 1 on the combined print and e-book fiction list, and it's been on the list for 78 weeks. (Its sequel, \"Iron Flame,\" comes in at No. 3, with 52 weeks on the list.) On social media, specifically its bookish corners, \"Onyx Storm\" has been the talk of the town, with creators posting detailed recaps of the first two books, fervent theories and most importantly, their excitement to return to the world of Navarre.",

      "When it comes time to actually write the books, Yarros says she sometimes alters course from her outline. For example, Violet facing the Gauntlet, a vertical obstacle course that riders must complete before they have a chance to bond with a dragon, was not initially part of her plan.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018You know, they really need to prove themselves.\u2019 They really need to do something that\u2019s like, \u2018This is how I can ride a dragon,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI just drew the Gauntlet, and suddenly it was \u2014 I was writing it.\u201d",
      "The world of the \"Empyrean\" series is expansive, and only growing with each subsequent book. While \"Fourth Wing\" was primarily set at Basgiath War College, its twisty ending saw Violet's understanding of her continent flipped on its head. She's since encountered new lands, populations and mythical creatures.",

      "\"I keep an extensive bible that tells you who the character is, who their dragon is, what their signet is, what has happened to them, what their body looks like, where their scars are, everything like that,\" Yarros says. \"I keep it all meticulously, jot it down so that my editors don\u2019t, you know, come after me with spatulas.\"",
      "The complicated love interests of the 'Empyrean'",
      "With dragons, signets (essentially, special powers) and war, the \"Empyrean\" series is filled with fantasy elements. But the books are also known for their high-stakes romance and steamy scenes.",
      "Violet's main love interest is Xaden, a rebellion leader with a tendency to keep secrets. Their story has taken a classic enemies-to-lovers arc. Fans swoon over Xaden's intense love, but his at-times questionable decisions make him the series' de facto \"bad boy.\"  With plenty of story ahead, there's a lot of room for things to change.",
      "(Warning: Major spoilers from \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Iron Flame\" ahead.)",
      "The end of \"Iron Flame\" marked a major turning point for Violet and Xaden. In a last ditch effort to save Violet, Xaden turned venin, meaning he gave up part of his soul for power.",
      "Up until this point, the venin had been cast as the series' big bad, the ultimate evil as they suck humans dry of their power. With \"Onyx Storm,\" Yarros faced the challenge of her popular \"bad boy\" actually going evil.",
      "\u201cI think as people, sometimes we see other people, and we think they are the epitome of evil, but no one takes a look to see how they get there and what drives someone to their motivations,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think the love of power often corrupts people. And in \u2018Fourth Wing,\u2019 it\u2019s taking a power that turns you venin. So really it\u2019s, yes, he\u2019s turning there, but he did it for such a righteous purpose, and sometimes that still turns us into monsters.\u201d",

When readers first meet Dain, he's Violet\u2019s childhood best friend and a potential love interest. But over the course of the first book, Dain and Violet grow distant, and he eventually betrays her, choosing his life of rule-following over Violet.",

So, he makes mistakes.\u201d",

      "\u201cHis biggest mistake is that when his best friend stops speaking to him, he violates her boundaries,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut so does Xaden, and no one seems to give Xaden quite the rap they give Dain.\u201d",
      "In \"Iron Flame,\" Dain surprises Violet (and some readers) when he rescues her from an interrogation, going against the leadership he had demonstrated ultimate loyalty to.",

So, it reads as though he\u2019s going to kill her, but it also reads as though he\u2019s saying, \u2018If you just trusted me last year, none of this would have happened.\u2019\u201d",
      "Writing 'Onyx Storm' and what's next",
      "Before the \"Empyrean\" series, Yarros had mainly written romances, such as 2019's \"The Last Letter\" and \"Full Measures\" in 2014.",
      "When she started writing \"Fourth Wing,\" she says she was at a point in her life where she felt unwilling to accept accommodations or limitations. She wanted to cram in 12 to 15 hours worth of writing a day, despite her body saying she shouldn't. Writing Violet's adaptation encouraged her to follow suit.",
      "\"It was me kind of talking to myself about what I needed to do to slow down, to protect my own body,\" she says. \"And I think I\u2019m finally starting to listen to it two-and-a-half years later.\"",
      "While \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Iron Flame\" published just seven months apart, \"Onyx Storm\" didn't hit shelves until about 14 months after the second book. Yarros needed a break \u2014\u00a0part of which she spent writing another book.",
      "Yarros says she felt she needed to prove to herself she could write another book, so she went back to her roots and drafted a contemporary romance called \"Variation,\" which published in October 2024.",
      "It was me kind of talking to myself about what I needed to do to slow down, to protect my own body. And I think I\u2019m finally starting to listen to it two-and-a-half years later.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet took a different route for his third \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d hosting gig.",
      "The actor pulled double duty on the Jan. 25 episode, joining the likes of Lily Tomlin and Gary Busey in the group of actors who have hosted and performed as the musical guest.",
      "Chalamet, who was nominated for best actor in a leading role at the 2025 Oscars for portraying Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d performed several of the musician's songs during the evening.",
      "He opted not to play any of the tracks that were featured on the movie\u2019s soundtrack, sharing in his monologue that the songs he chose were simply his \u201cpersonal favorites.\u201d",
      "Chalamet's first performance was teed up by an introduction from Adam Sandler before cutting to the actor on a dark stage wearing a  jacket with a fur-trimmed hood and an oversized pair of sunglasses.",
      "He began with the high-energy tune \u201cOutlaw Blues\u201d from the 1965 album \u201cBringing It All Back Home.\u201d In addition to singing live, Chalamet played electric guitar with support from a full band.",
      "The performance took a softer turn when Chalamet pivoted to a medley with the tune \u201cThree Angels\u201d from 1970\u2019s \u201cNew Morning.\u201d He ditched his guitar and left his spot center stage to join musician James Blake at his piano, sitting down to finish off the song.",
      "For his second performance of the night, Chalamet played \u201cTomorrow Is a Long Time,\u201d which was featured on \u201cBob Dylan\u2019s Greatest Hits Vol. II\u201d in 1971.",
      "The Academy Award nominated actor played the song solo at first. Chalamet sat on a stool on the dark stage with just his acoustic guitar to start the song before he was eventually joined by his band to round out the performance.",
      "Chalamet got a thumbs up from Dylan fans after his performances, with one user commenting on YouTube, \u201cThis Bob Dylan fan approves. You\u2019ve gone above and beyond.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a pretty big Dylan fan, I appreciate these deep cuts,\u201d another fan of the iconic artist wrote. \u201cGreat choices.\u201d",
      "Another YouTube user commended Chalamet's talent, writing, \u201cSeriously everything I see this kid in he just transforms - insanely talented.\u201d",
      "Some fans noted they became \"emotional\" watching Chalamet perform, with one fan writing, \"The second song was so emotional.  Anyone else out there shed a tear?\"",
      "One fan even joked, \u201cok I\u2019ve seen enough give him an Oscar.\u201d",
      "But not everyone was a fan. One person on X didn't appear to be thrilled by the actor's vocal abilities, writing, \u201cBe honest... it\u2019s not great! I you wanna watch actors who can sing... Cynthia Erivo \u2014 Ariana Grande. Your welcome.\u201d",
      "Chalamet transformed into Dylan in order to portray the musician in \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d which included showcasing his musical skills.",
      "The actor sang all of the songs for the film and performed them live on camera. He also put in several years of work leading up to the movie, including starting guitar lessons in 2019 as well as learning how to play the harmonica.",
      "Chalamet had no trouble poking fun at himself during the episode, including calling out the absurdity of him being the musical guest.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so grateful \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 is still doing weird stuff like this 50 years in,\u201d Chalamet said at the end of his monologue. \u201cThey\u2019re either really nice for letting me do this, or incredibly mean and this is all a big prank. I sincerely can\u2019t tell.\u201d",
      "Less than a month after Nikki Glaser joked about his facial hair at the Golden Globes, Chalamet noted in his monologue that it was his first time hosting with a \u201clittle stache and a little goatee.\u201d",
      "He even made a point to have the camera do a close up to capture all \u201c37 hairs\u201d on his face (he counted).",
      "Chalamet also had no trouble bringing up his past award show losses, at one point showing a montage of himself looking despondent in the crowd every time his name wasn't announced.",
      "Even when he tried to re-create a winning moment during the monologue, Kenan Thompson\u2019s name was called instead and Chalamet had to sit in the audience and watch the comedian give his acceptance speech."

      "The IDF\u2019s Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, said on X early Sunday morning saying that the Netzarim corridor, a military zone in Gaza City that effectively separates northern and central Gaza, remained closed \u201cin light of Hamas\u2019 breach of the cease-fire agreement.\u201d",
      "It is unclear why Yehud has not been freed, though it was initially believed she was held by Islamic Jihad.",
      "Hamas, in turn, has accused Israel of obstructing the ceasefire by blocking key areas and preventing Palestinians from returning to their homes, holding Israel responsible for any delays in fulfilling the terms of the agreement.",
      "Israel \u201ccontinues to renege on the ceasefire agreement, stalling and obstructing the implementation of its commitments,\u201d the Hamas statement said, adding that the agreement stipulates that Israel must withdraw from the Netzarim corridor.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2025 17:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Multiple defectors from North Korea spoke to NBC News about the mindset of soldiers sent to fight for Russia in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Few people understand what may be going through the minds of North Korean soldiers fighting and dying for Russia in the war against Ukraine. But Lee Chul Eun is one of them.",
      "Lee, 38, a North Korean defector and former soldier now living in South Korea, said it is \u201cdevastating\u201d to see troops from the reclusive, communist-ruled North being sent abroad by leader Kim Jong Un, \u201conly to then give up their youth for a land that is not even theirs but the foreign land of Russia.\u201d",
      "He is one of multiple defectors who spoke to NBC News about the training, conditions and mindset of North Korean soldiers, including their willingness to take their own lives if necessary.",
      "Lee said his former colleagues \u201care essentially just sent out to be cannon fodder on the front lines.\u201d",
      "For the first time since they arrived in Russia in the fall, North Korean soldiers have been captured alive by Ukrainian forces, with video and photos showing one man with bandages around his jawline and another with bandaged hands.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who announced the prisoners\u2019 apprehension earlier this month, said they were living proof that North Korea had entered the war, in a major escalation of the yearslong conflict.",
      "The U.S. and allies say there are more than 11,000 North Korean troops fighting in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion in August. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has confirmed the reports.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it is not easy to capture a North Korean soldier,\u201d Ryu Sung Hyu said in an interview in the South Korean capital, Seoul.",
      "All North Korean recruits are taught a song that includes a verse about saving their last bullet for themselves to avoid capture, said Ryu, who served in the North Korean military until 2019, when he escaped to freedom in South Korea.",
      "According to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, there was at least one recent incident in which a North Korean soldier, faced with possible capture by Ukrainian forces, tried to detonate a grenade while shouting Kim\u2019s name but was killed before he could succeed.",
      "The South Korean military said last week that North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after about 300 of its soldiers were killed and 2,700 others were injured. The high casualty rate was due to the soldiers\u2019 poor understanding of modern warfare, as well as the way they were being deployed by Russia, South Korean lawmakers said.",
      "Their willingness to fight and die for Russia could be a major factor in determining the course of the Ukraine war, as well as the level of American military aid to Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism over continued U.S. support.Kim is thought to be providing Russian President Vladimir Putin with troops and weapons in hope of receiving technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. His flurry of weapons testing has continued with three launches already this year, including multiple short-range ballistic missiles, a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile and strategic cruise missiles.",
      "Trump drew ire from South Korea on Tuesday after he described the reclusive regime as a \u201cnuclear power,\u201d a phrase that U.S. officials have long refrained from using, as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.",
      "Kim is sending troops to Russia for two reasons, \u201cboth of which are driven by desperation,\u201d said Ahn Chan Il, who served in the North Korean military for over a decade and defected to South Korea in 1979. The first is to earn foreign currency, which is in short supply in North Korea under United Nations sanctions imposed over its weapons programs.The deployment also provides valuable experience for the North Korean military, which has not been deployed overseas since the Vietnam War.",
      "Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council this month that fighting alongside Russia makes North Korea \u201cmore capable of waging war against its neighbors.\u201d",
      "Lee, who spent five years in the North Korean military, said the troops had been sent to Russia as mercenaries rather than soldiers, noting that they weren\u2019t wearing their uniforms. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service has said they were given Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, along with forged identification documents.",
      "\u201cEven if they die there it does not matter, because North Korea sent them out without officially recognizing them,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey were sent there not to bring honor to the country, but to give up their lives and bring back lots of money.\u201d",
      "'No longer a part of the society'",
      "Military service is compulsory in North Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s largest standing armies. Soldiers undergo three months of basic training before being assigned to a unit, said Lee, who came to South Korea in 2016 after swimming for six hours from the North.",
      "\u201cAs soldiers,\u201d Lee said, \u201cthey are told they are individuals who are now no longer a part of the society and their families, and must follow the orders of the supreme leader,\u201d meaning Kim.",
      "They have no trouble believing this, having been indoctrinated by North Korean propaganda from childhood, said Lee.",
      "North Korean soldiers spend most of their time not actually being soldiers but working on farms and construction projects, Lee and others said.",
      "\u201cI think I only fired three bullets per year,\u201d said Lee Hyun-seung, who served in the North Korean military for more than three years. When he moved to a more elite unit, he said, \u201cwe had more like 20 bullets.\u201dAsked whether he thought the North Korean troops could help Russia win the war, Lee \u2014 whose family defected in 2014 and who now lives in the U.S. \u2014 was skeptical.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not that sure,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I know their training and I know they are not well trained.\u201d",
      "For North Korean soldiers, who receive food and clothing but are otherwise essentially unpaid, the main enemy is hunger.",
      "North Korea struggles with food shortages as Kim devotes the majority of resources to his weapons programs, meaning that, like most of the broader population, soldiers suffer from malnutrition and can even starve to death.",
      "Meals are made up mainly of plain rice, corn or potatoes, sometimes mixed with grass or even tree bark, said Lee Chun Eul.",
      "He said his feelings about North Korea changed gradually, largely due to his exposure to foreign media that finds its way into the country despite tight government controls \u2014 \u201cJames Bond\u201d was a favorite of his growing up in the 1990s. More recently, the North Korean government has been alarmed by the popularity of South Korean TV dramas, sentencing two teenagers to 12 years of hard labor for watching them.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at North Korean mercenaries sent to Russia, I wonder if they would still have joined if they had watched as much foreign media as I did in North Korea,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI also wonder if the North Korean regime and Kim Jong Un\u2019s dictatorship would still be in place.\u201d",
      "The defectors say they hope the North Korean troops fighting in Russia will take the opportunity to leave like they did.",
      "\u201cWhen North Korean workers, who have lived their entire lives trapped in a restrictive system, experience life abroad, they come to see North Korea as nothing short of a prison,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cOnce they realize what freedom could mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine they wouldn\u2019t consider breaking free to live a freer life.\u201dIn addition to finding freedom, they could provide the U.S. and others with valuable intelligence regarding the North Korean military\u2019s strategies and capabilities, which are often exaggerated by the North Korean government.",
      "Ahn and other North Koreans who defected as soldiers have offered Ukraine their assistance against the North Korean troops.",
      "\u201cHowever, rather than directly participating in the war, our focus is on psychological warfare to change the mindset of North Korean soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough platforms like YouTube or leaflets, we aim to deliver messages to the North Korean troops, urging them not to die meaningless deaths and instead seek freedom.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, they watch with heavy hearts as casualties mount among North Korean soldiers whose experiences they know only too well.",
      "\u201cThese young people did not go knowing they were going to die,\u201d Lee said, \u201cbut died because they did not know.",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer and Stella Kim reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong."

    "story": [
      "O\u015aWI\u0118CIM, Poland \u2014 The Soviet Red Army troops who arrived here on Jan. 27, 1945, helped uncover one of the greatest atrocities ever committed by \u2014 and against \u2014 humankind.",
      "Inside the Auschwitz concentration camp complex, the soldiers liberated roughly 7,000 prisoners who had been brutalized by a Nazi regime hell-bent on exterminating the Jewish people. The horrors there defied comprehension.",
      "Eighty years later, some former prisoners returned to mark the 80th anniversary of their deliverance \u2014 a date that is known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day.",
      "In the eyes of so many around the world, the survivors\u2019 very existence is a resounding act of defiance against the world-historic cruelty and vast injustice of Adolf Hitler\u2019s reign of terror. Their stories of survival are also implicit pleas to the world: Never forget humanity\u2019s capacity to commit unthinkable crimes.",
      "Hitler\u2019s regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews during World War II, including roughly 1 million people at Auschwitz. The Nazis also persecuted other peoples, including Poles, the Romani, Soviet prisoners, gay men and mentally and physically disabled people.",
      "The Nazis tried to hide evidence of the genocide they perpetrated, including burning the remains of roughly 900,000 Auschwitz victims who were killed in the gas chambers.",
      "Eva Umlauf was only 2 when she and her mother were liberated from the camp \u2014 too young to remember the actual day. But the Holocaust is etched onto her skin \u2014 A-26,959 tattooed on her left forearm, marking her for life, along with some other Auschwitz survivors.",
      "\u201cYou are just a number,\u201d Umlauf, 82, a pediatrician from Munich, told NBC News, explaining how this number will forever make her feel. \u201cBut this number is not only on the skin. This is deeper.\u201d",
      "For Umlauf, who traveled for the ceremony along with her sister, her son and one of her grandchildren, this was more than a personal journey of memory and reflection. It was a moral responsibility.",
      "\u201cThey have to know that it\u2019s true. You know, because it\u2019s so, so unbelievable, unbelievable that nobody can believe this,\u201d she said.",
      "But even given what has been established about the Third Reich\u2019s crimes against humanity, some of the most vital information has still not been uncovered. Notably, the names of more than a million Jews slaughtered by the Nazis are still unknown, according to Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s official Holocaust memorial center.",
      "Alexander Avram leads a team at Yad Vashem that has amassed more than 2 million \u201cPages of Testimony\u201d and historical documents to verify more identities. The project is known as the Hall of Names.",
      "\u201cThere are no cemeteries, there are no tombstones \u2026 for most of the Holocaust victims,\u201d Avram told NBC News. \u201cEach additional name that we can recover is, for us, another victory against the Nazis, because the Nazis didn\u2019t [only] want to \u2026 exterminate the Jews physically. They wanted to obliterate even their memory.\u201d",
      "Avram said researchers have started experimenting with artificial intelligence to scour testimonial documents in hope of finding names that might have been overlooked. But that technology is useless without firsthand accounts provided by the shrinking pool of survivors.",
      "The Claims Conference estimates that only 1,000 survivors of Auschwitz are still alive. In that regard, Avram\u2019s team is \u201cin a rush against time,\u201d he said.",
      "The anniversary comes at a troubling and unsettled time. Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack on Israel, Israel\u2019s ensuing war in Gaza and the proliferation of hate speech on social media have fueled a worldwide spike in antisemitism.",
      "In some countries, basic knowledge of the Holocaust is eroding.",
      "The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, a nonprofit organization that helps Holocaust victims seek compensation, released an eight-country survey last week showing that 46% of adults ages 18-29 in France, for example, \u201chad not heard or weren\u2019t sure if they had heard of the Holocaust prior to taking the survey.\u201d",
      "Nearly half of Americans surveyed were unable to name a single Nazi camp, according to the Claims Conference\u2019s findings, and more than a quarter (26%) of Americans ages 18-29 disagreed with the following statement: \u201cThe Holocaust happened, and the number of Jews who were killed during the Holocaust has been accurately and fairly described.\u201d",
      "World leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, flew in for Monday\u2019s commemoration. Top dignitaries, including Britain's King Charles III, attended, as well.",
      "\u201cWe really believe that this is the last milestone anniversary where we\u2019ll have a visible group of survivors who are still able to tell us their stories,\u201d Pawe\u0142 Sawicki, deputy spokesman for the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, said in an interview at the camp Saturday.",
      "\u201cThe choice for this year\u2019s anniversary was very simple: We need to put them into the spotlight,\u201d he added.",
      "In recent statements, Western heads of state have tried to underscore the importance of preserving the historical memory of the Holocaust, known in Hebrew as the Shoah.",
      "\u201cI am against turning the page, saying that was long ago,\u201d German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a gathering of the Jewish community in Frankfurt this month. \u201cWe keep alive the memory of the civilizational split of the Shoah committed by Germans, which we pass down to each generation in our country again and again.\u201d",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the grounds of Auschwitz on Jan. 17, describing the \u201csheer horror\u201d he felt there and vowing to fight the rising tide of antisemitism in his country.",
      "Roughly 50 survivors of Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps attended Monday\u2019s commemoration. In recent days, hundreds of visitors from around the world have come to the former camp to pay their respects.",
      "Josh Sesar, 52, of Los Angeles, who made his second trip to Auschwitz on Friday, said he believed it is vital to see the grounds firsthand.",
      "\u201cI think it is not taught enough in school in America, and if you watch the news in America now, you see the philosophies that people are following now and they are happy to pretend that this never happened,\u201d Sesar said.",
      "\u201cIt is scary, because there are not so many survivors left, and so when there [are] no survivors, people even more so try to discredit history,\u201d he added.",
      "Aron Krell, 98, a Holocaust survivor who was imprisoned at Auschwitz and ultimately liberated from the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria, said it is incumbent on Jewish people, educators, historians and other advocates to keep the legacy of the Shoah intact.",
      "In a video interview last week, Krell described his liberation as his \u201csecond birthday.\u201d",
      "\u201cI saw the light again in front of me,\u201d Krell said. \u201cMy second birthday is more important, really, than the first. We always celebrate it: Aron Krell has two birthdays.\u201d",

      "Lithuania plans to lay mines on its bridges to Russia, ready to detonate should Kremlin tanks try to cross. In the nearby Baltic Sea, NATO ships are hunting Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cShadow Fleet\u201d accused of cutting undersea communications cables. And in Europe\u2019s skies there are plans to construct a vast missile defense system, similar to Israel\u2019s \u201cIron Dome\u201d but with the explicit purpose of shooting down rockets launched by Moscow.",
      "European governments and citizens worry that an emboldened Kremlin may turn his armies their way after Ukraine. There is also widespread nervousness that the new U.S. president \u2014 an isolationist \u2014 has suggested he may not defend America\u2019s historical NATO allies if they are attacked by Russia.",
      "While President Donald Trump this week criticized Vladimir Putin,  Trump has showed few signs of a meaningful shift from that position. On Thursday, he said in an interview with Fox News that Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwas fighting a much bigger entity,\u201d and that \u201che shouldn\u2019t have done that, because we could have made a deal.\u201d",
      "He said little new about NATO or Europe, only reiterating his latest demand for European allies to pay 5% of their GDP toward defense \u2014 more than twice the NATO recommendation \u2014 and lamenting how much more Washington has spent than Brussels toward supporting Ukraine\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cNATO has to pay more,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between.\u201d",
      "The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. European officials have repeatedly stated that Putin is preparing for a war with the West. For many, this is already happening, with think tank analysts, governments and NATO itself accusing Moscow of \u201chybrid warfare\u201d attacks \u2014 from election interference to trying to crash airliners with firebombs.",
      "\u201cThe Europeans are taking this very seriously,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe between 2014 and late 2017.",
      "In particular, countries in Eastern Europe nearer the Russian border \u201cknow that this is for real, because they live there,\u201d Hodges added. \u201cIt\u2019s only those people who live in Western Europe or the U.S., far away from the Bear, who say: \u2018Come on, this is not going to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "The core tenet of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is that allies will defend any fellow member under attack. The only time this \u201cArticle 5\u201d promise has been triggered was after 9/11, when Europe helped the United States patrol its skies in an act of solidarity. The main message of that stipulation is that if a country attacks Europe, it will also be at war with Washington, and its intended audience is Russia.",
      "But Trump has repeatedly suggested he would ignore Europe\u2019s distress call.",
      "Plenty of those in Europe\u2019s corridors of power agree that a complacent continent has for too long relied on Washington\u2019s protection. French President Emmanuel Macron, a longtime proponent of European self-reliance,\u00a0said Monday that Trump\u2019s second term should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the continent.",
      "In comments made at a defense conference on Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, agreed with Trump\u2019s assessment of European spending, saying that \u201cRussia poses an existential threat to our security today, tomorrow and for as long as we underinvest in our defense.\u201d",
      "Many of these critics remain nonetheless alarmed.",
      "\u201cWhile every president has complained that European countries don\u2019t do enough, there never was a question about American commitment,\u201d said Hodges. \u201cThis causes a lot of anxiety.\u201d",
      "In the short term, Trump and key members of his incoming administration have vowed to quickly end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, likely impossible without huge territorial concessions from Kyiv. Effectively giving Russia a win would be a signal to the Kremlin that aggression is rewarded and the West has no appetite to intervene, critics say.",
      "\u201cRussia is preparing for a war with the West,\u201d German foreign intelligence chief Bruno Kahl said in a November speech.",
      "For years, experts and government officials have accused Moscow of spreading disinformation, launching cyberattacks and using any other means necessary to meddle in the elections of democratic countries.",
      "Though Moscow denies it. Western officials and experts are near united in agreeing that this campaign only seems to be expanding.",
      "Last month, Finnish authorities seized an oil tanker they suspected of having severed undersea power and internet cables. That was among a spate of incidents that prompted NATO to launch operation \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d stepping up maritime patrols.",
      "Meanwhile, Western officials said Russia was responsible for sending two incendiary devices to DHL logistics hubs in Germany and the United Kingdom in July as part of a wider sabotage campaign to possibly start fires aboard North America-bound aircraft.",
      "In response, Europe has reversed decades of military underfunding, with most of its big powers now hitting the NATO guideline of 2% of GDP spent on defense. Spending started to increase in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, although Trump is widely credited for accelerating it.",
      "On Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s defense commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, announced that Lithuania intends to spend between 5% and 6% of its GDP on defense in the coming years.",
      "Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has focused minds further.",
      "In March, the European Union allocated 500 million euros (around $515 million) to double shell ammunition production to 2 million units per year. And 22 countries have now joined the European Sky Shield Initiative, a continentwide missile defense system designed to protect against Russian attacks.",
      "\u201cEurope must be prepared for the most extreme military contingencies,\u201d a spokesperson for the bloc told NBC News in an email when asked whether the continent was preparing for a worst-case scenario of war with Russia. \u201cPut simply: to prevent war we need to spend more. If we wait more, it\u2019ll cost us more.\u201d",
      "Asked if that change was prompted by Trump\u2019s suggestion he may not defend Europe as well as Putin, the spokesperson referred only to the Russian president, whose war in Ukraine they said \u201cchallenges the international rules-based order itself.\u201d",
      "For its part, Ukraine\u2019s reaction to the re-election and inauguration of Trump has been assiduously diplomatic. On Inauguration Day, Zelenskyy said in a post on X that Trump \u201cis always decisive\u201d and that his second term was an opportunity to \u201cachieve a long-term and just peace.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe need to make it very clear to the Kremlin that any attack against a NATO member is going to cost and have consequences,\u201d said Jurkonis, who also teaches politics at Lithuania\u2019s Vilnius University.",
      "The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are particularly vulnerable, perched on the Baltic Sea between mainland Russia and the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.",
      "For decades occupied by the Soviet Union, these now-Westernized states are only now constructing \u201cthe Baltic Defense Line,\u201d a frontier hundreds of miles long dotted with anti-tank trenches and pillboxes. Lithuania has already purchased warehouses full of \u201cdragon\u2019s teeth\u201d \u2014 concrete pyramids designed to stop tanks \u2014 and plans to mine its bridges to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, its defense ministry told NBC News.",
      "Lithuania recently said it would raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, the highest in NATO and far more, proportionally, than Washington\u2019s 3.4%. That\u2019s still lower than Russia, with the Kremlin effectively reordering its economy along a war footing and committing at least 6.2% of its inflation-hit finances to its military.",
      "In western Scandinavia, meanwhile, Norway has updated its emergency preparedness booklet that it hands out to all citizens, telling them how much water, food and other supplies to stockpile in case of \u201cacts of war.\u201d The 20-page document has historically focused on extreme weather and accidents, but its most recent version notes that \u201cwe live in an increasingly turbulent world\u201d and warns that \u201cin the event of an act of war, you may be notified that you should seek shelter.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Swedish church authorities \u2014 on guidance from Sweden\u2019s armed forces \u2014 have begun looking for extra cemetery space should such a conflict reach their shores. And Germany committed around 100 million euros to reinstate public sirens that were removed when the Iron Curtain fell.",
      "And yet there are plenty of observers who believe that Europe is not doing nearly enough.",
      "Western European countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom have only committed \u201csmall percentage uplifts to defense budgets, which is nothing like the transformative investment\u201d in Eastern Europe, said Keir Giles, a leading defense analyst at London\u2019s Chatham House think tank.",
      "For Giles, author of \u201cWho Will Defend Europe? An Awakened Russia and a Sleeping Continent,\u201d the problem is that \u201ccountries further away are still pretending that war is something that happens to other people.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 For women in China, it may feel as if there is little to laugh about these days.",
      "The world\u2019s second-largest economy is struggling to recover from the pandemic, and the government is cracking down on feminist activism as it encourages women to embrace \u201ctraditional\u201d female roles as wives and mothers.",
      "But women were laughing nonetheless, as amateur performers told jokes about office and family life to a small but engaged audience of about 20 people, mostly young women, at a Western restaurant in Beijing on a recent winter evening.",
      "Alex Wang, the only female performer out of about half a dozen that night, said she felt \u201cempowered\u201d when she first got on stage a few years ago.",
      "Though \u201cbeing funny is the most important thing,\u201d she said in an interview after her performance, \u201cI want to grow not just as a comedian but as a woman finding her voice in this space.\u201d",
      "The growing role of women in China\u2019s stand-up scene, along with the recent success of funny female-oriented films, reflect one way feminism is breaking into the Chinese mainstream: through comedy.",
      "The feminist movement is facing strong resistance in China, even as women attain new educational heights and make strides in the workplace.",
      "For the first time in decades, there is not a single woman among the 24 members of the Politburo, the senior leadership of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.\u00a0President Xi Jinping has personally called on women to embrace a \u201cchildbearing culture\u201d as the world\u2019s once-most-populous country struggles with low birth rates.",
      "The government has made no secret of its crackdown on feminist activity. In June, Chinese journalist and #MeToo activist Huang Xueqin was sentenced to five years in prison for subversion.",
      "But even Chinese state media had praise for \u201cHer Story,\u201d a feminist comedy directed by and starring women that was a box-office hit in China late last year. The state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily lauded the film\u2019s portrayal of the \u201chumorous and absurd\u201d aspects of daily life.",
      "The film has been described as China\u2019s answer to the 2023 hit \u201cBarbie,\u201d openly calling out stereotypes about women, sexuality, single parenting and divorce \u2014 all issues that can be sensitive here.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d may be able to get around that in part because its social critique is couched in comedy, said Feng Yuan, the founding director of Beijing Equality, a women\u2019s rights and gender equality nongovernment organization.",
      "In addition to helping evade censors, comedy is a \u201chandy tool to speak out your anger,\u201d she said.",
      "The film tells the story of Wang Tiemei, a newly unemployed single mother of a 9-year-old daughter, and their young female neighbor Xiao Ye in Shanghai. Despite their different personalities, the two women form a strong bond as they navigate personal challenges, including Wang\u2019s abusive ex-husband.",
      "Its frank tone has also inspired discussions about female sexuality akin to those set off by recent U.S. films such as the Nicole Kidman-starring erotic thriller \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare to see stories about single moms or just women\u2019s lives in general,\u201d Zhang Tong, 25, said at a Beijing theater last month after seeing \u201cHer Story,\u201d which she called \u201cquite moving.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will help more women, especially young women, understand themselves better and feel empowered to live for themselves,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d has made 720 million yuan ($99 million) since its release on Nov. 22, according to the Chinese box office site Maoyan, and has a score of 9.1 out of 10 on Douban, a Chinese film rating site.",
      "Though the film did not crack China\u2019s top 10 highest-grossing films last year, another movie directed by and starring women, \u201cYolo,\u201d topped the list at 3.4 billion yuan ($470 million). Its director, Chinese comedian Jia Ling, also directed the 2021 female-oriented comedy \u201cHi, Mom,\u201d which grossed more than 5.4 billion yuan ($742 million), making her the world\u2019s top-grossing female filmmaker until Greta Gerwig with \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "The success of these films marks a shift in the Chinese box office, the second-largest in the world after the United States, where the biggest movies have typically been male-dominated, patriotism-themed blockbusters.",
      "\u201cMy movie delivers something different from others, showing some novelty, so people like it,\u201d Shao Yihui, the director of \u201cHer Story,\u201d told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "Women who perform stand-up comedy in China say they are also offering something different in an industry that only a few years ago was a sea of men.",
      "Wang said her jokes are informed partly by her experience as a woman.",
      "\u201cFor example, earlier I had a bit where I made fun of those awful guys who think everyone in the world is into them,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve also done material on topics like period stigma.\u201d",
      "She cited the influence of Yang Li, who is perhaps the most recognizable female figure in Chinese stand-up comedy. At her peak, she performed in front of millions of viewers on national television, delivering punchlines on the male psyche.",
      "\u201cI think what she and other everyday female comedians talk about, especially from a female perspective, really reflects the current state of society,\u201d Wang said. \u201cTheir material brings attention to issues women face, and you can clearly see how those jokes resonate with people.\u201d",
      "But they don\u2019t resonate with everyone.",
      "In October, Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com ended a promotional campaign featuring Yang after men offended by her ribbing flooded social media with complaints and accused of her of provoking \u201cgender antagonism,\u201d a term also used by Chinese state media to criticize feminism.",
      "As feminists have raised their voices in China, so have those with misogynist views, Feng said, and Yang made for a clear target.",
      "\u201cThey are always looking for some outlet to release their anger,\u201d she said.",
      "Chinese comedians say they have to be mindful of censors as well as fragile egos and cultural sensitivities. In 2023, a Chinese entertainment firm representing a stand-up comic was fined almost $2 million after he was accused of insulting the People\u2019s Liberation Army during a Beijing performance. The entire industry went to ground for more than a year, with stand-up comedy not returning to Chinese television until last fall.",
      "\u201cFor a Chinese audience, a lot of topics, it is kind of like we are not sure if we can laugh at that,\u201d said Nico Toomuch, 34, a stand-up comedian in Beijing.",
      "That hasn\u2019t stopped Toomuch, who has been performing since 2016, from joking about everything from marriage to menstruation and depression \u2014 drawing in part on her strengths as a woman.",
      "\u201cWe are more sensitive, emotional, and we are better at observing things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we can take a joke, so we can deliver one.\u201d"

      "The Chinese startup DeepSeek has made waves after releasing AI models that experts say match or outperform leading American models at a fraction of the cost. The meteoric rise of the previously little-known company spooked U.S. investors Monday, wiping out almost $600 billion in the market value of American chipmaker Nvidia in the biggest drop in the nation's market history.",
      "In China, DeepSeek is being heralded as a symbol of the country\u2019s AI advancements in the face of U.S. export restrictions that Beijing says are aimed at suppressing its technological development.",
      "\u201cThis jaw-dropping breakthrough has come from a purely Chinese company,\u201d said Feng Ji, founder and chief executive of Game Science, the developer behind the hit video game Black Myth: Wukong.",
      "\u201cDeepSeek may be a national-level technological and scientific achievement,\u201d he wrote in a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "Zhou Hongyi, co-founder of the Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, said China would \u201cundoubtedly come out on top\u201d in the U.S.-China AI race.",
      "\u201cIf we are to counter America\u2019s AI tech dominance, DeepSeek will definitely be a key member of China\u2019s \u2018Avengers team,\u2019\u201d he said in a video on Weibo.",
      "So how did a little-known startup become a global AI sensation?",
      "Based in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, who is also the founder of a hedge fund called High-Flyer that uses AI-driven trading strategies.",
      "Liang has said High-Flyer was one of DeepSeek\u2019s investors, though it\u2019s unclear how much it contributed, as well as a source of some of its first employees.",
      "\u201cOur core technical roles are mostly filled by fresh graduates or those with just a year or two of work experience,\u201d he told the Chinese media outlet 36Kr in May 2023, adding that the company was looking for \u201cdown-to-earth individuals with curiosity.\u201d",
      "By 2022, High-Flyer had acquired 10,000 of Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips, according to a post that July on the Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. imposed restrictions on sales of those chips to China later that year.",
      "Liang told 36Kr that he acquired the chips mostly because of \u201ccuriosity about the boundaries of AI capabilities\u201d and that he had no particular commercial goal in mind.",
      "The stock market rout took place a week after DeepSeek\u2019s Jan. 20 release of an open-source language model called R1, which met with widespread acclaim in what venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called \u201cAI\u2019s Sputnik moment.\u201d",
      "Investors and the U.S. tech industry were further unnerved later in the week when DeepSeek published a technical report that said the model took only two months and less than $6 million to build, compared with the billions spent by leading U.S. tech companies.",
      "The surge in interest sent DeepSeek\u2019s recently released app to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store on Monday. The company later said that it was temporarily limiting user registrations \u201cdue to large-scale malicious attacks\u201d on its services, CNBC reported.",
      "New users were quick to note that R1 appeared subject to censorship around topics deemed sensitive in China, avoiding answering questions about the self-ruled democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims is part of its territory, or the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown or echoing Chinese government language. The model appears to operate without such restrictions, however, if it is used not through the DeepSeek website but on servers that host it outside mainland China.",
      "DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "The R1 model is now second only to California-based OpenAI\u2019s o1 in the artificial analysis quality index, an independent AI analysis ranking. It also beats leading models by Google, Meta and the  California-based Anthropic.",
      "Liang, who according to the China's media is about 40, has kept a relatively low profile in the country, where there has been a crackdown on the tech industry in recent years amid concerns by the ruling Chinese Communist Party that its biggest companies and executives might be getting too powerful.",
      "But he appeared on state television last week during a high-profile meeting with Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s No. 2 official, who invited Liang and other experts from technology, education, science and other fields to share their opinions for a draft government work report. At the meeting, Li called for \u201ctechnological innovation\u201d to foster the economy, according to state media reports.",
      "China has made AI a national priority, with the goal of becoming the global leader in its technology by 2030. The U.S., concerned about the potential military applications, has moved to limit China's access to American technology, including new restrictions on AI chips issued by Joe Biden in the final days of his presidency.",
      "President Donald Trump said Monday that DeepSeek\u2019s rise \u201cshould be a wake-up call\u201d for U.S. tech companies.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry referred a request for comment Tuesday to the relevant department.",
      "R1 has also drawn attention because, unlike OpenAI\u2019s o1, it is free to use and open-source, meaning anyone can study and copy how it was made.",
      "Most Chinese engineers are eager for their open-source projects to be used by foreign companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, in part because \u201cno one in the West respects what they do because everything in China is stolen or created by cheating,\u201d said Kevin Xu, the U.S.-based founder of Interconnected Capital, a hedge fund that invests in AI.",
      "\u201cThey are also aware that Chinese firms have been taking for free lots of open-source tech to advance,\u201d Xu, the former senior director for global expansion at GitHub, said Monday in a post on X, \u201cbut they want to create their own, contribute, and prove that their tech is good enough to be taken for free by foreign firms \u2014 some nationalism, some engineering pride.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek is not the only Chinese AI startup that says it can train models for a fraction of the price. Kai-Fu Lee, founder of 01.AI, has said that it cost $3 million to train its model and that U.S. restrictions on chip exports forced his company to innovate.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese companies are able to watch the innovations, make some themselves and then do better engineering,\u201d Lee, a former president of Google China, said at a conference in Saudi Arabia in October.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014\u00a0Both engines of the Jeju Air\u00a0plane that crashed last month contained\u00a0duck\u00a0remains, according to a preliminary report on Monday, with authorities still trying to determine what caused the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil.",
      "The six-page report released by South Korean authorities a month after the crash said both engines of the Boeing\u00a0737-800 jet contained\u00a0DNA\u00a0from Baikal teals, a type of migratory\u00a0duck\u00a0that flies to South Korea for winter in huge flocks.",
      "But the report provided no initial conclusions about what may have caused the plane to land without its landing gear deployed, and why flight data recorders stopped recording in the final four minutes of the flight.",
      "The Jeju Air flight from Bangkok on Dec. 29 overshot Muan airport\u2019s runway as it made an emergency belly landing and crashed into an embankment containing navigation equipment, called localizers, killing all but two of the 181 people and crew members on board.",
      "\u201cAfter the crash into the embankment, fire and a partial explosion occurred. Both engines were buried in the embankment\u2019s soil mound, and the fore fuselage scattered up to 30-200 meters from the embankment,\u201d the report said, providing some new pictures of the accident site.",
      "The\u00a0localizer\u00a0aids navigation of an aircraft making an approach to the runway, and the structure built of reinforced concrete and earth at Muan airport supporting the system\u2019s antennae most likely contributed to the high death toll, experts have said.",
      "The investigation will tear down the engines, examine components in depth, analyze in-flight and air traffic control data, and investigate the embankment, localizers and evidence of bird strike, the report said about its next steps.",
      "\u201cThese all-out investigation activities aim to determine the accurate cause of the accident,\u201d it said.",
      "The report highlighted much of the initial\u00a0findings\u00a0by the South Korean investigators that were\u00a0shared with victims\u2019\u00a0families on Saturday, including the pilots\u2019\u00a0awareness of a flock\u00a0of birds on\u00a0the plane\u2019s final\u00a0approach.",
      "The exact time\u00a0the\u00a0bird strike was reported\u00a0by the pilots remains unconfirmed, the accident report said, but the aircraft \u201cmade an emergency declaration (Mayday x 3) for a bird strike during a go-around.\u201d",
      "The report does not say what may have led to the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR) to stop recording simultaneously just before the pilots declared the emergency.",
      "The aircraft was at an altitude of 498 feet flying at 161 knots (185 mph) about 1.1 nautical miles (1.3 miles) from the runway at the moment the flight recorders stopped recording, it said.",
      "The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a U.N. agency, requires accident investigators to produce a preliminary report within 30 days of the accident and encourages a final report to be made public within 12 months.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board has shared its report with ICAO, Thailand, and the United States and France, which are the home states for the plane and engine manufacturers, an official said Monday."

    "story": [
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 Qatar announced early Monday that an agreement has been reached to release an Israeli civilian hostage and allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, easing the first major crisis of the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "The statement from Qatar, a mediator in ceasefire talks, said Hamas will hand over the civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, along with two other hostages before Friday. On Monday, Israeli authorities will allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza.",
      "The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement said the hostage release \u2014 which will include soldier Agam Berger \u2014 will take place Thursday, and it confirmed that Palestinians can move north on Monday. Israel\u2019s military said people can start crossing on foot at 7 a.m.",
      "Under the ceasefire deal, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, but it put that on hold because of Yehoud, who it said should have been released that day. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement.",
      "The release of Yehoud and two others is in addition to the one already set for next Saturday, when three hostages should be released.",
      "In addition, Hamas in a statement said the militant group had handed over a list of required information about all hostages to be released in the ceasefire\u2019s six-week first phase. The Israeli prime minister\u2019s office confirmed it had received it.",
      "Thousands of Palestinians have gathered, waiting to move north through the Netzarim corridor bisecting Gaza. Local health officials on Sunday said Israeli forces fired on the crowd, killing two people and wounding nine.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump meanwhile suggested that most of Gaza\u2019s population be at least temporarily resettled elsewhere, including in Egypt and Jordan, to \u201cjust clean out\u201d the war-ravaged enclave. Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians rejected that amid fears that Israel might never allow refugees to return.",
      "Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said Palestinians would never accept such a proposal, \u201ceven if seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction.\u201d He said the Palestinians can rebuild Gaza \u201ceven better than before\u201d if Israel lifts its blockade.",
      "Dispute and shootings test fragile ceasefire",
      "Israeli forces fired on the waiting crowds on three occasions overnight and into Sunday, killing two people and wounding nine, including a child, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties.",
      "Israel\u2019s military in a statement said it fired warning shots at \u201cseveral gatherings of dozens of suspects who were advancing toward the troops and posed a threat to them.\u201d",
      "Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza under the ceasefire, which came into effect last Sunday. The military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which still operate in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor.",
      "Hamas freed four female Israeli soldiers on Saturday, and Israel released some 200 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom were serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks. But Israel said Yehoud should have been released ahead of the soldiers.",
      "Hamas said it had told mediators \u2014 the United States, Egypt and Qatar \u2014 that Yehoud was alive and provided guarantees that she would be released.",
      "Frustration grew among the Palestinians waiting to go north as some warmed around bonfires against the winter cold.",
      "\u201cWe have been in agony for a year and a half,\u201d said Nadia Qasem.",
      "Fadi al-Sinwar, also displaced from Gaza City, said \u201cthe fate of more than a million people is linked to one person,\u201d referring to Yehoud.",
      "\u201cSee how valuable we are? We are worthless,\u201d he said.",
      "Ending the war will be difficult",
      "The ceasefire is aimed at ending the 15-month war triggered by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack and freeing hostages still held in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Around 90 hostages are still in Gaza, and Israeli authorities believe at least a third, and up to half, have died.",
      "Itzik Horn, the father of hostages Iair and Eitan Horn, called any resumption of fighting \u201ca death sentence for the hostages\u201d and criticized government ministers who want the war to go on.",
      "The ceasefire\u2019s first phase runs until early March and includes the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The second \u2014 and far more difficult \u2014 phase, has yet to be negotiated. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israel has threatened to resume its offensive until Hamas is destroyed.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. More than 100 were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more, at least three of them mistakenly killed by Israeli forces. Seven have been freed in the latest ceasefire.",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence.",
      "Israeli bombardment and ground operations have flattened wide swaths of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people. Many who have returned home since the ceasefire began have found only mounds of rubble."

      "\u201cNeeded!\u201d the posters proclaim beneath a photo of Lukashenko, his hands clasped together. The phrase is what groups of voters responded in campaign videos after supposedly being asked if they wanted him to serve again.",
      "But his opponents, many of whom are imprisoned or exiled abroad by his unrelenting crackdown on dissent and free speech, would disagree. They call the election a sham \u2014 much like the last one in 2020 that triggered months of protests that were unprecedented in the history of the country of 9 million people.",
      "The crackdown saw more than 65,000 arrests, with thousands beaten, bringing\u00a0condemnation and sanctions\u00a0from the West.",
      "His iron-fisted rule since 1994 \u2014 Lukashenko took office two years after the demise of the Soviet Union \u2014 earned him the nickname of \u201cEurope\u2019s Last Dictator,\u201d relying on subsidies and political support from close ally Russia.",
      "He let Moscow use his territory to invade Ukraine in 2022, and even hosts some of Russia\u2019s tactical nuclear weapons, but he still campaigned with the slogan \u201cPeace and security,\u201d arguing he has saved Belarus from being drawn into war.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s better to have a dictatorship like in Belarus than a democracy like Ukraine,\u201d Lukashenko said in his characteristic bluntness.",
      "Fearing a repeat of election unrest",
      "His reliance on support from Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 himself in office for a quarter-century \u2014 helped him survive the 2020 protests.",
      "Observers believe Lukashenko feared a repeat of those mass demonstrations amid economic troubles and the fighting in Ukraine, and so\u00a0scheduled the vote in January, when few would want to fill the streets again, rather than in August. He faces only token opposition.",
      "\u201cThe trauma of the 2020 protests was so deep that Lukashenko this time decided not to take risks and opted for the most reliable option when balloting looks more like a special operation to retain power than an election,\u201d Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich said.",
      "Lukashenko repeatedly declared that he wasn\u2019t clinging to power and would \u201cquietly and calmly hand it over to the new generation.\u201d",
      "His 20-year-old son, Nikolai, traveled the country, giving interviews, signing autographs and playing piano at campaign events. His father hasn\u2019t mentioned his own health, even though he was seen having difficulty walking and occasionally spoke in a hoarse voice.",
      "\u201cThe successor issue only becomes relevant when a leader prepares to step down. But Lukashenko isn\u2019t going to leave,\u201d Karbalevich said.",
      "Top political opponents imprisoned or exiled",
      "Leading opponents have fled abroad or were thrown in prison. The country holds nearly 1,300 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate\u00a0Ales Bialiatski, founder of the Viasna Human Rights Center.",
      "Since July, Lukashenko has pardoned more than 250 people. At the same time, authorities have sought to uproot dissent by arresting hundreds more in raids targeting relatives and friends of political prisoners.",
      "Authorities detained 188 people last month alone, Viasna said. Activists and those who donated money to opposition groups have been summoned by police and forced to sign papers saying they were warned against participating in unsanctioned demonstrations, rights advocates said.",
      "Lukashenko\u2019s four challengers on the ballot are all loyal to him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m entering the race not against, but together with Lukashenko, and I\u2019m ready to serve as his vanguard,\u201d said Communist Party candidate Sergei Syrankov, who favors criminalizing LGBTQ+ activities and rebuilding monuments to Soviet leader Josef Stalin.",
      "Candidate Alexander Khizhnyak, head of the Republican Party of Labor and Justice, led a voting precinct in Minsk in 2020 and vowed to prevent a \u201crepeat of disturbances.\u201d",

      "The fourth challenger, Hanna Kanapatskaya, managed 1.7% of the vote in 2020 and says she\u2019s the \u201conly democratic alternative to Lukashenko,\u201d promising to lobby for freeing political prisoners but warning supporters against \u201cexcessive initiative.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe repressions have become even more brutal as this vote without choice has approached, but Lukashenko acts as though hundreds of thousands of people are still standing outside his palace,\u201d she said.",
      "The European Union\u00a0rejected the election\u00a0in Belarus on Sunday as illegitimate and threatened\u00a0new sanctions.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s sham election in Belarus has been neither free, nor fair,\u201d EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and EU enlargement commissioner Marta Kos said in a joint statement.",
      "Shortly after voting in Minsk on Sunday, accompanied by his white Pomeranian dog, Lukashenko told journalists that he did not seek recognition or approval from the EU.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me is that Belarusians recognize these elections and that they end peacefully, as they began,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking at an hourslong news conference, Lukashenko said that he didn\u2019t rule out running for the top job again in 2030.",
      "Media freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders filed a complaint against Lukashenko with the International Criminal Court over his crackdown on free speech that saw 397 journalists arrested since 2020. It said that 43 are in prison.",

      "According to the Central Election Commission, there are 6.8 million eligible voters. However, about 500,000 people have left Belarus and aren\u2019t able to vote.",
      "Two hours before polls closed at 8 p.m. local time (1700 GMT), the commission said that turnout stood at 81.85%, but a dearth of independent monitoring made that figure near-impossible to verify.",
      "At home, early voting that began Tuesday has created fertile ground for irregularities with ballot boxes unguarded until election day, the opposition said. A record 41.81% of voters cast ballots in five days of early voting. Meanwhile, Viasna activists reported internet issues across the country, and alleged Lukashenko\u2019s government was blocking access to VPN services commonly used to evade censorship.",
      "Polling stations have removed the curtains covering ballot boxes, and voters are forbidden from photographing their ballots \u2014 a response to the opposition\u2019s call in 2020 for voters to take pictures to make it more difficult for authorities to rig the vote.",
      "Police conducted large-scale drills before the election. An Interior Ministry video showed helmeted riot police beating their shields with truncheons as a way to prepare for protest dispersals. Another featured an officer arresting a man posing as a voter, twisting his arm next to a ballot box.",
      "Belarus initially refused to allow observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored previous elections. It changed course this month and invited the OSCE \u2014 when it was already too late to organize a monitoring mission.",
      "Increasing dependence on Russia",
      "Lukashenko\u2019s support for the war in Ukraine has led to the rupture of Belarus\u2019 ties with the U.S. and the EU, ending his gamesmanship of using the West to try to win more subsidies from the Kremlin.",
      "He spoke of Russian nuclear weapons deployed in Belarus as a guarantee of peace, and said he would pick Moscow as his first official visit if he\u2019s reelected.",
      "\u201cUntil 2020, Lukashenko could maneuver and play Russia against the West, but now when Belarus\u2019 status is close to that of Russia\u2019s satellite, this North Korea-style election ties the Belarusian leader to the Kremlin even stronger, shortening the leash,\u201d said Artyom Shraybman, a Belarus expert with the Carnegie Russia and Eurasia Center.",
      "After the election, Lukashenko could try to ease his total dependence on Russia by again seeking to reach out to the West, he predicted.",
      "\u201cLukashenko\u2019s interim goal is to use the election to confirm his legitimacy and try to overcome his isolation in order to at least start a conversation with the West about easing sanctions,\u201d Shraybman said.",
      "American woman released from detention",
      "An early sign of Minsk\u2019s desire to reengage with the West came on Sunday, as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on X that Belarus had \u201cunilaterally\u201d released a U.S. citizen, Anastassia Nuhfer.",
      "It took the public and even Belarusian rights activists by surprise \u2014 her name hadn\u2019t been publicly released, and hadn\u2019t featured on lists of political prisoners."

      "Moving past guilt over the atrocities of Germany\u2019s Nazi era is a key pillar of the AfD\u2019s platform.",
      "In echoing the party\u2019s attitude to Germany\u2019s past \u2014 a point of view that has drawn outrage inside Germany and abroad \u2014 the tech billionaire threw his support behind a party whose co-founder Alexander Gauland once dismissed the Nazi era as \u201cjust a speck of bird\u2019s muck in more than 1,000 years of successful German history.\u201d",
      "The AfD denies being extremist, although its leaders have said that Germany should stop apologizing for the Holocaust and the Third Reich.",
      "The timing of Musk\u2019s appearance at the AfD rally was also notable in that it came just days after he made a gesture in Washington that sparked widespread condemnation.",
      "Abraham Foxman, the former director of the Anti-Defamation League, said on X that Musk\u2019s appearance in and comments at the rally, just days after his speech in Washington, \u201chelp place the hand gesture in perspective.\u201d",
      "Foxman\u2019s comments on Musk\u2019s actions came in contrast to those of the ADL\u2019s current leadership.",
      "The ADL defended Musk after the gesture, suggesting on X \u2014 the social media platform that Musk owns \u2014 that the billionaire had made an \u201cawkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn this moment, all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt, and take a breath,\u201d it said.",
      "In his own attempt to downplay the allegations, Musk posted a joke referencing names of prominent Nazi leaders on X, also sparking a backlash.",
      "The ADL\u2019s chief executive, Jonathan Greenblatt, responded on the same platform saying that \u201cthe Holocaust is not a joke.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s comments at the AfD\u2019s rally also played into familiar AfD talking points on national identity and immigration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good to be proud of German culture, German values, and not to lose that in some sort of multiculturalism that dilutes everything,\u201d Musk said.",
      "The AfD has successfully used Germany\u2019s debate over immigration to bolster its popularity. The party adopted an explicitly anti-Islam policy in May 2016, and its 2017 election manifesto included a section on why \u201cIslam does not belong to Germany.\u201d",
      "The topic of immigration was one of many Musk discussed during an X broadcast earlier this month in which he spent more than an hour speaking with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel.",
      "As he has become increasingly vocal about his apparent move to the right of the political spectrum, Musk has thrown his support behind numerous right-wing causes, including the United Kingdom\u2019s hard-right Reform UK party and Italy\u2019s far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, calling her a \u201cprecious genius.\u201d",
      "But his most zealous support has been for the AfD, which heads into February\u2019s elections polling in second place after the collapse of Germany\u2019s left-led coalition government.",
      "While other German political parties have refused to join coalitions with the AfD due to its extreme positions, Musk has given the group a significant boost, most notably \u2014 before Saturday at least \u2014 with his X interview with Weidel.",
      "In the conversation, Weidel said that AfD is \u201cexactly the opposite\u201d of Adolf Hitler\u2019s party, adding that it\u2019s Europe\u2019s left-wing political parties who are antisemitic.",
      "\u201cWe are wrongly framed the entire time,\u201d she said."

    "summary": "South Korea\u2019s prosecutors indicted impeached President Yoon for leading an insurrection with his imposition of martial law, the main opposition party said.",
    "story": [
      "South Korea\u2019s prosecutors indicted impeached President\u00a0Yoon\u00a0Suk Yeol on Sunday on\u00a0charges\u00a0of leading an insurrection with his short-lived imposition of martial law on Dec. 3, the main opposition party said.",
      "The charges are unprecedented for a South Korean president, and if convicted,\u00a0Yoon\u00a0could face years in prison for his shock martial law decree, which sought to ban political and parliamentary activity and control the media.",
      "His move set off a wave of\u00a0political upheaval\u00a0in Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy and a top U.S. ally, with the prime minister also impeached and suspended from power and a number of top military officials indicted for their roles in the alleged insurrection.",
      "The prosecutors\u2019 office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The indictment was also reported by South Korean media.",
      "Anti-corruption investigators last week recommended charging the jailed\u00a0Yoon, who was impeached by parliament and suspended from his duties on Dec. 14.",
      "A former top prosecutor himself,\u00a0Yoon\u00a0has been in solitary confinement since becoming the first\u00a0sitting president to be arrested\u00a0on Jan. 15 after days of defiant, armed\u00a0standoff\u00a0between his security detail and arresting officials.",
      "Over the weekend a court twice refused prosecutors\u2019 request to extend his detention while they conducted further investigation, but with the charges they have again requested that he be kept in custody, media reports said.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers had urged the prosecutors to release him immediately from what they call illegal custody.",
      "Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. It is punishable by life imprisonment or death, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades.",
      "\u201cThe prosecution has decided to indict\u00a0Yoon\u00a0Suk Yeol, who is facing charges of being a ringleader of insurrection,\u201d Democratic Party spokesman Han Min-soo told a press conference. \u201cThe punishment of the ringleader of insurrection now begins finally.\u201d",
      "Yoon\u00a0and his lawyers\u00a0argued\u00a0at a Constitutional Court hearing last week in his impeachment trial that he never intended to fully impose martial law but had only meant the measures as a warning to break political deadlock.",
      "In parallel with his criminal process, the top court will determine whether to remove\u00a0Yoon\u00a0from office or reinstate his presidential powers, with 180 days to decide.",
      "South Korea\u2019s opposition-led parliament impeached\u00a0Yoon\u00a0on Dec. 14, making him the second conservative president to be impeached in the country.",
      "Yoon\u00a0rescinded his martial law after about six hours after lawmakers, confronting soldiers in parliament, voted down the decree.",
      "Soldiers equipped with rifles, body armor and night-vision equipment, were seen entering the parliament building through smashed windows during the dramatic confrontation.",
      "If\u00a0Yoon\u00a0is removed from office, a presidential election would be held within 60 days."
