      "Did a wide-open Oscar race just get a frontrunner?",
      "Sean Baker's Brooklyn comedy \u201cAnora\u201d took top honors at both the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday night, catapulting it to Oscar favorite status with wins from a pair of closely watched Academy Awards precursors.",
      "Hollywood's award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders. Some had pegged \u201cAnora\u201d as the frontrunner going into the season after the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "But after a number of films took turns in the spotlight, including Golden Globe winners \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d and \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\" \u201cAnora\u201d reemerged in a big way over the weekend. Baker's film also won best picture at the Critics Choice Awards on Friday.",
      "Both guild ceremonies were held in Beverly Hills, California. The PGA's top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, has matched the Oscar winner for best picture in 16 of the last 21 years. Since 2009, when the guild and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences both adopted a preferential ballot to pick a winner from 10 nominees, they've corresponded all but three times.",
      "The DGA is similarly predictive. In the past 74 years, 66 winners have gone on to triumph at the Oscars. That makes Baker the favorite for best director in a field entirely composed of first-time nominees.",
      "The guild also named RaMell Ross' \u201cNickel Boys\" best first film. Ross' movie, nominated for best picture by the Oscars, is his narrative film debut.",
      "Oscar voting begins Tuesday. Jacques Audiard's \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\" is the lead nominee with 13 nominations, but the Netflix film has seen its chances crater following multiple waves of backlash and controversy.",
      "Another Oscar category also found clarity over the weekend. On Saturday at the Annie Awards, DreamWorks Animation's \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d cleaned up with nine awards including best film. \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d will be the heavy favorite to win best animated film at the March 2 Academy Awards."

      "NEW YORK -- Tony Roberts, a versatile, Tony Award-nominated theater performer at home in both plays and musicals and who appeared in several Woody Allen movies \u2014 often as Allen's best friend \u2014 has died. He was 85.",
      "Roberts\u2019 death was announced to The New York Times by his daughter, Nicole Burley.",
      "Roberts had a genial stage personality perfect for musical comedy and he originated roles in such diverse Broadway musicals as \"How Now, Dow Jones\" (1967); \"Sugar\" (1972), an adaptation of the movie \"Some Like It Hot,\" and \"Victor/Victoria\" (1995), in which he co-starred with Julie Andrews when she returned to Broadway in the stage version of her popular film. He also was in the campy, roller-disco \"Xanadu\" in 2007 and \"The Royal Family\" in 2009.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never been particularly lucky at card games. I\u2019ve never hit a jackpot. But I have been extremely lucky in life,\u201d he write in his memoir, \u201cDo You Know Me?\u201d \u201cUnlike many of my pals, who didn\u2019t know what they wanted to become when they grew up, I knew I wanted to be an actor before I got to high school.\u201d",
      "Roberts also appeared on Broadway in the 1966 Woody Allen comedy \"Don't Drink the Water,\" repeating his role in the film version, and in Allen's \"Play It Again, Sam\" (1969), for which he also made the movie.",
      "Other Allen films in which Roberts appeared were \"Annie Hall\" (1977), \"Stardust Memories\" (1980), \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy\" (1982), \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" (1986) and \"Radio Days\" (1987).",
      "\u201cRoberts\u2019 confident onscreen presence \u2014 not to mention his tall frame, broad shoulders and brown curly mane \u2014 was the perfect foil for Allen\u2019s various neurotic characters, making them more funny and enjoyable to watch,\u201d The Jewish Daily Forward wrote in 2016.",
      "In Eric Lax's book \"Woody Allen: A Biography,\" Roberts recalled a complicated scene in \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy\" that Allen shot over and over \u2014 even after the film had been edited \u2014 to get his intended effect.",
      "\"When you go back to see (Allen's work) two, three, four times, you begin to see the amazing amount of art in it, that nothing is accidental,\" Roberts said.",
      "Among his other movies were \"Serpico\" (1973) and \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\" (1974).",
      "He was nominated twice for a Tony Award \u2014 for \"How Now, Dow Jones\" and \"Play It Again, Sam,\" when he was billed as Anthony Roberts.",
      "One of Roberts' biggest Broadway successes was Charles Busch's hit comedy \"The Tale of the Allergist's Wife\" (2000), in which he played the title character's husband.",
      "Roberts, who made his Broadway debut in 1962 in the short-lived \"Something About a Soldier,\" also was a replacement in some of its longest-running hits including \"Barefoot in the Park,\" \"Promises, \"Promises,\" \"They're Playing Our Song,\" \"Jerome Robbins' Broadway,\" \"The Sisters Rosensweig\" and the 1998 Roundabout Theatre Company revival of \"Cabaret.\"",
      "\u201cI was lucky enough to get in on the last years of the Golden Age of Broadway. In that era there was a lot more going on that seemed to have high quality about it and great conviction,\u201d he told Broadway World in 2015.",
      "In London, he starred with Betty Buckley in the West End production of \"Promises, Promises,\" playing the Jack Lemmon role in this stage version of \"The Apartment.\"",
      "Roberts' television credits include the short-lived series \"The Four Seasons\" (1984) and \"The Lucie Arnaz Show\" (1985) as well as guest spots on such well-known shows as \"Murder, She Wrote\" and \"Law & Order.\"",
      "Roberts was born in New York on Oct. 22, 1939, the son of radio and television announced Ken Roberts.",
      "\"I was raised in the middle of a lot of actor talk,\" he told the AP in 1985. \"My cousin was Everett Sloane, who was a very fine actor. My father's friends were mostly actors. I'm sure that in some way I needed to prove myself in their eyes.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- They're at the top of their sport. They run, weave and go airborne. And they went all out for this weekend's championship.",
      "Sorry \u2014 no, they're not the Chiefs or the Eagles. They're the agility dogs at the Westminster Kennel Club show, which began Saturday by showcasing agility and other dog sports.",
      "Dog folk often call Westminster the Super Bowl of dog shows, and the comparison might be especially fitting this year. The United States' most prestigious canine competition opened on the same weekend as pro football's Super Bowl, which features the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The rare coincidence comes after both competitions' dates shifted in recent years.",
      "\u201cI always said I wanted people to call the Super Bowl \u2018the Westminster of football,\u2019 \u201d quipped dog expert David Frei, who has a foot in both worlds: He used to work in publicity for the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers.",
      "The Westminster of football? Well, Westminster is 90 years older than the Super Bowl, after all.",
      "And there have been some other connections between the gridiron and Westminster\u2019s green carpet. Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Morgan Fox co-owns a French bulldog who came within a smushy-nose length of winning at Westminster in 2022 and was a finalist the following year. (Many other NFL players also have dogs for fun, if not for show, including Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes.)",
      "Whatever the analogy, being at Westminster was a triumph for Guster the rescue pug. He and owner Steve Martin took up agility after Guster started wagging his tail and tilting his head while they watched the Westminster agility contest on TV several years ago.",
      "\u201cWe never thought we\u2019d be here. And now we\u2019re here,\u201d Martin, of Austin, Texas, said Saturday.",
      "A border collie named Vanish won the contest, which featured about 350 champion-level contestants in one of dogdom's most popular sports.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s very intuitive, very natural -- probably smarter than me,\u201d handler Emily Klarman told a Fox interviewer in the ring. While Klarman said the win initially left her speechless, Vanish had plenty to say, barking enthusiastically.",
      "A sizeable, black-and-white dog named Gable won a special award for the best mixed-breed competitor.",
      "Westminster added agility in 2014, marking the show's first event with mixed-breed dogs since the 1800s. Last year saw the first mixed-breed agility winner, a border collie-papillion mix named Nimble, who competed again this year.",
      "She's an intentional blend of two top agility breeds. But the sport also draws rescue dogs such as an Australian cattle dog mix named Sawyer, or Soy Sauce for short.",
      "His owner, Dr. Amy Ondeyka, has a complicated work schedule as a New Jersey emergency room doctor and EMS medical director. But she made time for agility after realizing she'd adopted a super-energetic dog who opens cabinets, unzips things and otherwise causes domestic mayhem when bored.",
      "\u201cHe's always exciting \u2014 he does ridiculous things,\u201d she said as he intermittently leaped into her arms during what was ostensibly down time between agility runs Saturday. \u201cWe have fun, regardless what happens.\u201d",
      "While some dogs do agility to burn off energy, the sport helps others come out of their shell. Tully, a lanky, shaggy, mostly-Labradoodle mix, used to be \u201cafraid of the world\u201d but now is excited to go to agility classes and competitions, owner Carla Rash said.",
      "Saturday's canine competitors were a spectrum of dogdom, from a great Dane to a seven-pound (0.9-kg) papillion, and they included such lesser-known breeds as a large Munsterlander and a Danish-Swedish farmdog.",
      "They navigated jumps, tunnels, ramps and other obstacles as handlers gave hand and voice signals. The object is to be the fastest, without making mistakes.",
      "Regardless of scores, some dogs won cheers from spectators. There was a bichon frise with its tail dyed blue, a standard poodle that took a leisurely trot across an A-frame ramp, and a curly-coated mix that apparently had second thoughts about the weave poles, circled around and went through them again.",
      "Westminster\u2019s traditional, breed-by-breed judging happens Monday and Tuesday, capped by the coveted best in show prize Tuesday night.",
      "That's for purebreds only, but mixed-breed dogs also were eligible for Saturday's obedience competition, an event that Westminster added in 2016. The top prize went to Willie, an Australian shepherd who also won in 2022 with handler Kathleen Keller of Flemington, New Jersey.",
      "Steve Wesler sported a Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt as he cheered on partner Jennifer Weinik and Cookie, her Belgian Malinois. They came away with a ribbon, which Wesler deemed more exciting than the Super Bowl \u2014 because he was confident the Eagles would prevail.",
      "There are no cash prizes at Westminster, but the agility and obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 donation to a training club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund.",
      "The show also featured Westminster's first demonstration of flyball, a canine relay race that involves retrieving a ball.",
      "\u201cIt's a lot of organized chaos,\u201d Hillary Brown said with a chuckle after competing with her Boston terrier, Paxil. His teammates on a York, Pennsylvania-based squad called Clean Break are a standard poodle, a border collie and a whippet-border collie mix.",
      "\u201cIt's a blast. The dogs love it,\u201d Brown said.",

His novel will bring back Dr. Wilbur Larch from \u201cThe Cider House Rules,\u201d but otherwise features a new set of characters. According to Simon & Schuster, \u201cQueen Esther\u201d will span much of the 20th century as it follows the life of Esther Nacht, a Viennese Jew born in 1905, abandoned at age 4 and taken in as a teen by a New England family.",
      "Irving ends the story in Jerusalem, in 1981.",
      "\u201cThe construction of this novel long predates the events of Oct. 7, and everything that\u2019s happened in Israel since those terrorist attacks and the hostage-taking,\" Irving said in a statement. \u201cWith hindsight, it\u2019s easy to say that what I saw and heard in Israel in the early 1980s serves as a precursor to what has developed since that time, but this is what historical fiction is for.\u201d",
      "Irving, 82, is also known for such acclaimed works as \u201cThe Hotel New Hampshire,\u201d \u201cThe World According to Garp\u201d and \u201cA Prayer for Owen Meany.\u201d He published \u201cThe Cider House Rules\u201d in 1985 and won an Oscar for writing the screenplay for the 1999 movie adaptation.

      "Federal government payments for subscriptions to media outlets have become the latest target of President Donald Trump's spending hawks",
      "NEW YORK -- Federal government payments to news outlets like Politico, The New York Times and The Associated Press for subscriptions or to license content are in the crosshairs of Trump administration spending hawks, with the president on Thursday calling it potentially \u201cTHE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the latest in a series of skirmishes with the media, long a target of Donald Trump and his supporters. The Defense Department last week evicted NPR, NBC, the Times and Politico from their Pentagon workspaces, and Trump has continued to criticize CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d for its handling of an interview with former opponent Kamala Harris last fall. Free press advocates are also concerned about Trump\u2019s plans for the media outlet Voice of America, whose charter guarantees its editorial freedom.",
      "This time, though, is a bit different. By linking federal government spending to the media, Trump has bundled two of his long-favored political targets into one rhetorical package \u2014 denouncing a common practice as untoward while offering no supporting evidence for his assertions.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the government had paid more than $8 million for Politico subscriptions and that Elon Musk's government efficiency team \u201cis working on canceling those payments.\u201d That quickly set off a social-media maelstrom and a hunt by online sleuths for other evidence of taxpayer spending on the news.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government must stop paying for media subscriptions. Now,\u201d Richard Grenell, Trump's special mission envoy, posted on X.",
      "Trump, on his Truth Social platform, complained about payments to the \u201cFAKE NEWS MEDIA\u201d for creating good stories about Democrats. \u201cDid the New York Times receive money??? Who else did??? THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL,\u201d he wrote.",
      "And at a national prayer breakfast at the Capitol on Thursday morning, Trump touted the efforts to look into the media spending. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them left and right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them. We\u2019re catching them to a point where they don\u2019t know what the heck is going on. They can\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting caught.\u201d",
      "Politico, in a statement to readers from CEO Goli Sheikholeslami and Editor-in-Chief John Harris, said Thursday that it is not getting a government subsidy.",
      "\u201cIt is a transaction \u2014 just as the government buys research, equipment, software and industry reports,\" they said. \"Some online voices are deliberately spreading falsehoods. Let's be clear: Politico has no financial dependence on the government and no hidden agenda. We cover politics and policy \u2014 that's our job.\"",
      "It has not been unusual for governments, federal and state, to subscribe to major media outlets to keep up on important or strategic issues. The U.S. State Department, for example, may depend on international news reporting for clarity on incidents happening in countries where the United States has interests. Specialists in an agency like the Department of Transportation follow trade publications for industry trends.",
      "The Politico Pro service helps government and private sector customers \"track policy, legislation and regulations in real time with news, intelligence and a suite of data products,\" the company said. It would not discuss how many subscriptions it has sold, or the prices.",
      "The New York Times said it earned less than $2 million last year through government subscriptions, which are offered at a discounted rate. Through one arrangement, the Times gives access to more than 1 million active and retired military members and their families.",
      "\u201cThese officials and other public servants are simply seeking to better understand the world through our independent journalism, like millions of other Americans,\u201d spokesman Charlie Stadtlander said.",
      "Musk, also a frequent critic of the mainstream media and the owner of a platform that in many ways competes with it, retweeted one message on X that complained about the AP \u201craking in millions of dollars in government money for years.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot for long,\" Musk added. \u201dThis is obviously a huge waste of taxpayer money.\"",
      "AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said that \u201cthe U.S. government has long been an AP customer \u2014 through both Democratic and Republican administrations. It licenses AP's nonpartisan journalism, just like thousands of news outlets and customers around the world. It's quite common for governments to have contracts with news organizations for their content.\u201d",
      "The outlet would not reveal how much it is earning in federal government contracts.",
      "Separately, Musk's focus on the USAID agency has threatened some $268 million in congressionally-authorized funding aimed at offering training and support to some 6,200 independent journalists working around the world, including in war-torn Ukraine, said the organization Reporters Without Borders.",
      "Denying the money \u201cwill create a vacuum that plays into the hands of propagandists and authoritarian states,\u201d said Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders' USA branch.",

But if you want to see them in all their ruby-red glory from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d there\u2019s no place like home \u2014 their current home, that is, at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles.",
      "There, Dorothy\u2019s shoes, worn by Judy Garland, are now on display as part of a sweeping exhibit on the history of color in cinema. It\u2019s a history in which the sequined slippers play a key role.",
      "While the 1900 novel by Frank L. Baum described them as silver, filmmakers in 1939 wanted to pack as much color as possible into the scene where Dorothy steps from sepia-toned Kansas into the shimmering color of the Land of Oz, where Glinda gives her the shoes off the feet of the Wicked Witch of the East. They were showing off a new technology: Technicolor.",
      "The exhibit, \u201cColor in Motion: Chromatic Explorations of Cinema,\u201d running through July 13, is timely not only because everything Oz is new again.",
      "It also highlights the largely unsung role that women played in the development of color in Hollywood, not only on screen but off, where labor-intensive jobs like hand-coloring and stenciling gave them a foothold in a male-dominated industry.",
      "There's also a fanciful interactive installation where your own body creates cinematic explosions of color, on the spot.",
      "Here are some highlights:",
      "Those glistening slippers nestled against a wall \u2014 rather unobtrusively, given their iconic status \u2014 began their life as white silk pumps. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d costume designer Adrian (known by his first name) dyed them red and embellished them with nearly 5,000 sequins.",
      "One of four known pairs used for the film that still exist, they were secured with great fanfare and help from luminaries like Leonardo DiCaprio, and were displayed when the museum opened in September 2021.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re certainly one of the biggest treasures we have in our collection,\u201d says Jessica Niebel, curator of the color show. \u201cEver since they came down, we\u2019ve gotten regular visitor feedback asking to see the ruby red slippers back on display. This was the perfect opportunity.\u201d",
      "The shoes are silver in both Baum\u2019s 1900 novel and in Gregory Maguire's 1995 book \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,\u201d on which the Broadway show and movie are based.",
      "Some nine years after \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d another movie put a pair of red shoes front and center. They were ballet pointe shoes, and the film, fittingly, was \u201cThe Red Shoes.\u201d",
      "The sad story of a young ballerina forced to choose between her career and a romance, the movie , by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, starred Moira Shearer, a real-life ballerina. Its tragic 17-minute dance sequence tells a story within a story \u2014 a young woman who dances in the red shoes until she dies.",
      "Curators placed these prized red pointe shoes front and center because, Niebel says, \u201cThe Red Shoes\u201d highlights both the magical nature of red and the role color plays in the expression of physical movement through dance.",
      "Poignantly, the pointe shoes are not perfect, but worn \u2014 just as the character\u2019s white dress turns gray and dirty as she is gradually consumed.",
      "Silent films were in black and white, right?",
      "Well, no, actually. In this gallery, silent film excerpts show that many were in color. \u201cIn the 1920s, most films, 80-90%, we think, were in color,\u201d Niebel says. \u201cThey only became black and white with the arrival of sound.\u201d",
      "Before that, the majority of films where were tinted and toned, curators say, meaning an entire filmstrip is submerged in one color, often a bright one like yellow or pink or red or blue.",
      "Curators went to four film archives in Europe and the U.S. and scanned their filmstrips. \u201cIn this gallery, for the first time, you can see how these colors authentically looked in the 1920s without any digital manipulation,\u201d Niebel says.",
      "Another section describes a phenomenon many know nothing about: leader ladies. These were women who appeared in the lead frame of a film reel to be processed in a color lab. They were invisible to audiences, but used to calibrate and process the color in a film.",
      "The display raises the issue that this process, which has disappeared with the digital age, largely excluded people of color.",
      "\u201cPredominantly they used to be white women,\u201d Niebel says. \u201cSo film stock and film materials were calibrated towards white skin predominantly. We wanted to tell this story as well \u2014 the story of these women who are never named, who the public never saw, but also the story of how film stock was developed particularly to depict white skin.\u201d",
      "The show begins with images of Lo\u00efe Fuller and the Serpentine Dance she invented, where colored light was reflected onto a flowing costume, changing the colors. An American dancer, Fuller experimented in the early 20th century with fabric, movement, and color techniques like gels and chemical salts.",
      "But many other women toiled in obscurity. There were, for example, the women at Disney, as the studio made a transition to color. We learn that under the leadership of Walt Disney's sister-in-law Hazel Sewell, the studio's ink and paint department became the animation industry\u2019s first all-female unit.",
      "And the French production company Path\u00e9 employed young women to hand-paint films \u2014 frame by frame \u2014 early in the 20th century. These young women earned less than their male counterparts. Still, it was more than they were able to earn in other professions.",
      "As kids know from finger painting, there\u2019s nothing more fun than making color yourself \u2014 especially color that moves. That\u2019s the takeaway from a final gallery in which your own physical movement creates cascades of color.",
      "\u201cBody Paint,\u201d by artist Memo Akten, allows you to stand in front of a screen, spread your arms, jump up and down or move any which way you want as a camera translates the moves into color.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s time for visitors to become animators of colors themselves through their own bodies,\u201d Niebel says. She's seen people stop and perform full-on dances at the installation.",
      "\u201cIt seems to bring people together,\u201d she says."

      "It's a happy homecoming for the United States' most prestigious canine event, which moved to venues outside Manhattan in recent years because of the coronavirus pandemic and then other considerations. But organizers longed to return to the self-described World\u2019s Most Famous Arena.",
      "\u201cIf you love dogs and you want to see the very best dogs from all around the world competing for the top prize of best in show at Westminster, just be there,\u201d club President Donald Sturz said. For fans who can't be there in person, Fox Sports is showing the event's various components on FS1 and FS2 and streaming some on the network's website and app; Westminster is streaming some others. The competition spans Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, with best in show awarded around 11 p.m. Tuesday on the East Coast.",
      "Might Mercedes, the German shepherd who was Westminster\u2019s runner-up last year, become top dog this time? Or could this be the year for Monty the giant schnauzer, who was a Westminster finalist the last two years, won the American Kennel Club\u2019s big show in December and is currently the sport's top-ranked dog? Will the prize go to another high-ranking dog \u2014 or a dark horse?",
      "Here are the basics on Westminster and the dog show world it epitomizes.",
      "It begins Saturday morning at the Javits Center convention hall with agility and obedience championships and some demonstration events, including Westminster's first experiment with flyball. That's essentially a canine relay race that involves running a course of jumps and retrieving a ball.",
      "The traditional, breed-by-breed judging \u2014 what show folk call \u201cconformation\u201d \u2014 unfolds Monday and Tuesday. First-round competition, where dogs are judged against others of their breed, happens during the daytime at the Javits Center. Then, in what are essentially semifinals, each breed winner is judged against others within its \u201cgroup\u201d of dozens of breeds at Madison Square Garden in the evenings. In the final round, the seven group winners compete for best in show Tuesday night.",
      "At each level, judges decide which dog in the ring best matches the ideal, or \u201cstandard,\u201d for its own breed.",
      "About 2,500 dogs from 201 breeds and varieties (subsets of breeds) are signed up to compete.",
      "Hailing from every U.S. state and 12 other countries, contestants include such familiar breeds as golden retrievers and such rarities as sloughis. No doodles, though. At least for now, those poodle mixes aren't recognized as purebreds by the American Kennel Club, the governing body for Westminster and many other U.S. dog shows.",
      "Dachshunds are the best-represented breed, with 52 entered.",
      "The agility and obedience contests involve a few hundred more dogs, including mixed-breed ones. Last year a border collie-papillion combination named Nimble became the first mixed-breed winner in the agility trial\u2019s decade-long history.",
      "First, breeders determine which puppies are physically and temperamentally suited for showing. Those pups are raised, trained and groomed to put their best paw forward in the show ring. \u201cBeginner puppies\u201d can start competing in AKC shows at 4 months.",
      "Some owners exhibit their own dogs where and when they can. Others have professional handlers who crisscross the country to compete most weekends, sometimes with multiple pooches.",
      "Trying for a national ranking is known as \u201ccampaigning\u201d a dog, and no wonder. As in politics, hopefuls \u2014 or, here, their owners and handlers \u2014 may gather intel about rivals\u2019 plans and either seek or avoid a face-off. They may weigh a particular judge's record. Some even run full-page ads in dog magazines to congratulate, salute and promote their animals.",
      "All Westminster dogs are champions, as measured by their sport's complicated point system. But yes, there are stats, kept by the Canine Chronicle magazine.",
      "Besides Monty and Mercedes, entrants include Vito, a pug who won the National Dog Show televised Thanksgiving Day, along with 2024 Westminster semifinalists Comet the shih tzu and Louis the Afghan hound. There's a high-ranking otterhound, representing one of the country's rarer breeds, and a big-winning wire fox terrier, whose breed won more than any other at Westminster.",
      "Still, show cognoscenti often say victory goes to \u201cthe dog on the day,\u201d meaning the one that has the performance of a lifetime.",
      "And regardless which dog the judge chooses, others sometimes win the audience's heart. Among the crowd faves over the years: a Sussex spaniel who sat up straight on his hind legs before the judge; a treat-seeking Leonberger who gnawed at his handler\u2019s pocket while going around the ring; and a shiba inu shown by a 10-year-old girl.",
      "Wire fox terriers have taken the top prize 15 times, most recently in 2019. Poodles of various sizes have 11 wins. A miniature poodle named Sage won last year.",
      "Many breeds haven't won yet, including such favorites as the French bulldog and Labrador retriever. But never say never: Two of the last three winners have been firsts for their breeds: the petit basset griffon Vend\u00e9en and the bloodhound.",
      "Bragging rights, ribbons and trophies. There are no cash prizes, though the agility and obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 Westminster donation to a training club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund.",
      "Animal rights activists routinely protest outside, and sometimes inside, the show. During last year's final round, someone carrying a sign reading \u201cboycott breeders\u201d tried to climb into the ring. The demonstrator was quickly intercepted and arrested.",

      "A Texas crisis communications specialist has sued Blake Lively for defamation after the actor pulled him into her legal fight with co-star and director Justin Baldoni over their film, \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "Jed Wallace and his company, Street Relations, filed the $7 million lawsuit in federal court in Texas on Tuesday. It says he had nothing to do with any campaign to harm Lively's reputation as she alleged in a court filing.",
      "Wallace is not among the defendants in Lively's federal lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company and publicists, in which she alleges sexual and other harassment during the production and a campaign to smear her after it. The crisis specialist is named in the court papers and the New York Times story published on the day the series of legal battles began in December when Lively filed a complaint.",
      "Lively\u2019s lawyers said in a statement that Wallace\u2019s lawsuit \u201cis not just a publicity stunt.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is transparent retaliation in response to allegations contained within a sexual harassment and retaliation complaint that Ms. Lively filed with the California Civil Rights Department,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile this lawsuit will be dismissed, we are pleased that Mr. Wallace has finally emerged from the shadows, and that he too will be held accountable in federal court.\u201d",
      "In a filing last week in Hays County, Texas, that seeks a deposition from Wallace, Lively alleges he was used by publicists working with Baldoni to weaponize \u201ca digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums.\u201d",
      "Wallace's lawsuit says neither he nor his company \"had anything to do with the alleged sexual harassment, retaliation, failure to investigate or aiding and abetting the alleged harassment or alleged retaliation.\u201d",
      "It says the actor's Texas filing \u201cconceded that Lively has no facts supporting the allegations she made against Wallace and Street,\" which is why she now seeks to investigate the extent of his conduct.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A$AP Rocky 's lawyers will make their case and try to establish a counternarrative Friday at his trial in Los Angeles, where the hip-hop star and fashion mogul is charged with firing a gun at a former friend on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "They plan to call to the stand rapper A$AP Twelvyy, who, like both the defendant and the man he's charged with shooting, was a member of the A$AP Mob, a group of young artists and creators that formed at a New York high school nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Twelvyy was one of two members of the crew who accompanied Rocky to a meetup with A$AP Relli, with whom he had a long-simmering beef that came to a head, he said, when Rocky fired a gun at him.",
      "Twelvyy is expected to testify that Rocky fired a starter pistol that only shoots blanks, which he carries as a prop for security. The defense contends that the phony gun answers many questions about the case, including why Relli only had grazed knuckles and no other injuries.",
      "The potentially confusing set of \u201cA$AP\u201d names have become familiar to people in the courtroom, and most likely the jury, through the approximately three days of Relli's testimony, which makes up the bulk of prosecutors' case, rested on Thursday.",
      "Rocky has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, and if convicted on both, he can legally get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Rihanna, the superstar singer who is Rocky\u2019s longtime partner and the mother of their toddler sons, slipped into the courtroom Thursday afternoon and sat in Rocky\u2019s section after several days of absence. She had her hair up and wore glasses with a tan trenchcoat on a rainy day in LA.",
      "The defense has not said whether Rocky will take the considerable risk of going on the stand himself, which he is not legally required to do. He already opted to take a significant risk by turning down the prosecution's pre-trial offer of a recommended sentence of just 180 days in jail and other relatively minor penalties in exchange for a guilty plea on one count.",
      "Raised in Harlem, the Grammy nominee had his mainstream breakthrough when his first studio album went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2013.",
      "But his role as a fashion maven has almost eclipsed his music. He is set to be a celebrity co-host on fashion's biggest night, the Met Gala, in May.",
      "The suits he wears in the courtroom and the overcoats he wears outside it have become fodder for discussion and inspired a New York Times story on his style.",
      "A publicist for Yves Saint Laurent sent a news release, of the kind usually reserved for red carpets, saying that one day in court he was wearing an \u201cYves jacket in wool chine,\u201d a \u201cshirt in silk crepe de chine\u201d and \u201chigh-waisted pants in wool chine.\u201d",
      "His fashion sense even came up in phone recordings played in court, in which a person purported to be Relli declares that Rocky was \u201cnot a true gangster\u201d and that \u201cthis is the case of Dior.\u201d",
      "The defense has already brought one witness it was allowed to call early, an internet branding consultant who worked with both Rocky and Relli. He recorded phone calls, purportedly with Relli saying his main intention was to get millions from Rocky, and the criminal case didn't matter.",
      "Relli said in his testimony that the recordings were fake.",
      "But prosecutor John Lewin established that everything Relli said in them was consistent with his testimony.",

      "The City of New Orleans says it has spent more than 18 months preparing to host its 11th Super Bowl on Feb. 9",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- After a New Year's Day terror attack struck New Orleans' historic French Quarter, city officials say they are confident in the security plans they have in place for Sunday's Super Bowl.",
      "More than 125,000 visitors \u2014 including President Donald Trump \u2014 are expected to converge on the Big Easy this week for days of revelry capped off by the clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at the Caesars Superdome to crown this season's NFL champion.",
      "Following the truck-ramming attack that killed 14 people and injured dozens more along Bourbon Street, one of the city's most famous thoroughfares, alleged security lapses triggered multiple lawsuits and investigations. But the city, the NFL and law enforcement officials insist that after more than a year of preparations, they are ready to play host.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going above and beyond what we\u2019ve seen in the past when we\u2019ve hosted previously,\u201d Mayor LaToya Cantrell said. \u201cWe know we\u2019re safer than we\u2019ve ever been before.\u201d",
      "Approximately 2,000 law enforcement officers will be present for the Super Bowl, New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters Wednesday.",
      "No vehicle traffic will be allowed on the Bourbon Street, and the city will block intersections leading to the most popular areas, Kirkpatrick said.",
      "Security has had to \u201cheighten\u201d with Trump's visit announced on Tuesday, and the city \u201cwill have to shut down some additional streets a little longer in order to provide a safe corridor for him,\u201d Kirkpatrick said.",
      "Drones are prohibited above downtown New Orleans and around the Superdome in the days leading up to the game, and there will be flight restrictions up to 18,000 feet (5,486 meters), according to the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Armed federal air marshals will be stationed around the city's transportation hubs, scanning for suspicious people or activities and guarding against drones, said Noel Curtin, supervisory air marshal in charge with the Transportation Security Administration.",
      "Super Bowl events will sprawl across neighborhoods far beyond the stadium, said Homeland Security Investigations New Orleans Special Agent in Charge Eric DeLaune, who is leading federal coordination of security.",
      "Federal agencies from the FBI to the Secret Service are bringing in rooftop snipers and will position armored SWAT vehicles around the stadium, the French Quarter and downtown, DeLaune said.",
      "No one will be allowed inside a cordoned-off area surrounding the Superdome without credentials, and the city already has begun shutting down and limiting traffic on roads near the stadium. The perimeter will include blast barriers and trucks will be required to pass through giant X-ray machines typically used at border crossings, DeLaune said.",
      "Dozens of technicians and more than 100 bomb-sniffing dogs are conducting a days-long effort to scour the 400,000 square feet (37,161 square meters) of the Superdome and each of its more than 70,000 seats prior to game day, DeLaune said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to go from top to bottom on that building to make sure it\u2019s clear and it\u2019s safe. They open every door, check under every seat,\u201d DeLaune said.",
      "Much of the security infrastructure will carry over to the Mardi Gras season, which has been upgraded to Homeland Security's highest risk rating to receive more manpower and resources.",
      "Multiple lawsuits have claimed city authorities were aware of Bourbon Street's vulnerabilities to the kind of truck-ramming attack that the Islamic State group-inspired Shamsud-Din Jabbar carried out. He drove his F-150 around a police car parked as a makeshift barricade and plowed into pedestrians before he crashed and was killed by police.",
      "The bollard system of steel columns installed to block vehicle traffic was being replaced at the entrance to Bourbon Street at the time of the attack. It remains on track for completion before the Super Bowl, officials said.",
      "Authorities say they have brought in more types of physical barriers to protect entry points resulting from concerns that the new bollard system was not strong enough to block vehicle attacks.",
      "The NFL and federal and city agencies \u201cput a fresh set of eyes\u201d on their plans post-Jan. 1, DeLaune said, noting the New Orleans Police Department hired former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton and his team from high-profile security firm Teneo.",
      "\u201cNo specific or credible threats\u201d have surfaced, NFL security chief Cathy Lanier said Wednesday.",
      "In January, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry ordered the removal of multiple homeless encampments near the stadium and moved dozens of unhoused people into a temporary warehouse shelter.",
      "He also announced the creation of an \u201cenhanced security zone\u201d along Bourbon Street to bookend Super Bowl weekend and said he would deploy 350 National Guard members.",
      "After authorities found Jabbar had planted ice chests containing undetonated improvised explosive devices around the French Quarter, Landry declared a ban on coolers and ice chests in these areas and ordered mandatory searches of bags for anyone entering the Bourbon Street zone during Super Bowl weekend.",
      "In accordance with state law, firearms including permitless concealed carry guns will be allowed on Bourbon Street but not inside bars, city and state police say.",
      "\u201cBooze and firearms don\u2019t mix\u201d Kirkpatrick said, adding that officers will monitor for anyone \u201dnegligently carrying,\u201d such as having a gun tucked in a waistband instead of a holster.",
      "\u201cPeople will be extremely unwise to bring a firearm into our hospitality areas,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cDon\u2019t do it, there\u2019s no need for it folks.\"",
      "The Superdome\u2019s owner, ASM Global, has contracted New York-based artificial intelligence firm Dataminr to monitor potential and emerging threats in real time.",
      "The company will draw from over 1 million sources of public data across 150 languages, from social media to dark web forums to traffic cameras, Dataminr Chief Security Officer Robert Crowley said.",
      "Dataminr uses generative AI to produce memos alerting Superdome officials of trending patterns, such as an influx of posts showing swelling crowds or public disturbances as they unfold.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s stitching together all these little pieces of the puzzle to get a holistic, comprehensive view of what has just happened,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThe faster you know what is occurring, the quicker you can take better action.\u201d",

      "A mother is called to her child\u2019s school for an urgent meeting with his teachers in the Norwegian film \u201cArmand,\" which opens in theaters Friday",
      "A mother is called to her child\u2019s school for an urgent meeting with his teachers in the Norwegian film \u201cArmand,\u201d a riff on a claustrophobic courtroom thriller set in a primary school classroom.",
      "The film, which won the best first feature prize at Cannes last year, dolls out bits and pieces of information slowly and purposefully, building not a solid set of answers but a web of complications and ambiguities. It is a strange and fascinating experience that may be a bit frustratingly inconclusive but is never not compelling.",
      "Even the inciting incident is withheld from the audience for a time. We\u2019re thrown into a conversation between a junior teacher, Sunna (Thea Lambrechts Vaulen), an administrator type Asja (Vera Veljovic) and the school\u2019s principal, Jarle (\u00d8ysten R\u00f8ger). Asja and Jarle are entrusting Sunna to lead this conversation (though they'll have to join eventually). None of them are even quite sure what exactly happened, whether it was innocent or malicious, or what to do if they can get to the bottom of it. Jarle advises Sunna to treat it soberly, whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean.",
      "Not even Armand\u2019s mother Elisabeth ( \"The Worst Person in the World's\"Renate Reinsve ) gets a hint as to what the meeting is about. She\u2019s a famous actress whose career has come to a halt and who has been tabloid fodder recently. Elisabeth arrives at the classroom first and wants answers, understandably. Sunna must awkwardly delay providing any information until the other parents arrive to Elisabeth\u2019s increasing frustration. Sunna even stammers something reassuring that it\u2019s not too bad. She is, of course, lying because the accusation is serious and beyond any of their depths. Armand\u2019s classmate Jon has apparently told his parents, Sarah (Ellen Dorrit Petersen) and Anders (Endre Hellestve) that Armand has sexually abused and threatened him. They\u2019re both 6-year-olds.",
      "These aren\u2019t just schoolmates either but cousins and that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg of trauma and shared history in this room, haunted by characters who aren\u2019t even present: Armand and his dead father, Thomas. Neither of the kids is shown through the duration, and there\u2019s much debate over whether 6-year-olds would use the language that the adults allege.",
      "\u201cArmand\u201d is the directorial debut of writer-director Halfdan Ullmann T\u00f8ndel, who has the daunting pressure of being a descendant of cinema royalty. As if making a movie isn\u2019t hard enough on its own, T\u00f8ndel\u2019s grandparents are Liv Ullmann and Ingmar Bergman. And perhaps because of that \u201cArmand\u201d pushes away from the conventions of a straightforward, talky character study and plays with our perception of reality. Twice Elisabeth breaks into choreographed dance \u2014 both expressions of her emotional state and one of which takes a particularly sinister turn.",
      "One might expect that two unexpected dance sequences would be the standouts in a film, but \u201cArmand\u201d has another. It\u2019s also a release, in a way. After a while of back and forth, debates, reveals and non-starters, Elisabeth breaks out into uncontrollable laughter. This stretches on for several agonizing, astonishingly impressive minutes of mad exertion. It\u2019s really quite an acting marvel from Reinsve \u2014 and everyone else in the scene watching it all play out. A broken fire alarm that goes off sporadically helps keep the atmosphere nice and tense, as does Asja\u2019s random nose bleeds that always seem to derail pivotal decision-making moments.",
      "\u201cArmand\u201d engages in some stylish wheel spinning, broken up by some revelations and cathartic moments. And yet every time you feel like you have a grasp on the situation, something else arises that seems to undermine it. Ambiguity and inconclusiveness can be satisfying in cinematic storytelling, but this feels a little too underbaked either way. Ideas are introduced and abandoned, or not fleshed out well. Why, exactly, has she stopped working, for instance. And what\u2019s the story behind Anders\u2019 and Elisabeth\u2019s relationship? It\u2019s a promising debut from T\u00f8ndel, nonetheless \u2014 a film that will keep you engaged if not entirely satisfied.",
      "\u201cArmand,\u201d an IFC Films release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csexual material and some language.\u201d Running time: 116 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

    "story": [
      "Women folk singers are preserving one of Morocco's most cherished culturual traditions, a genre of folk singing known as aita",
      "SIDI YAHYA ZAER, Morocco -- Mbarka Moullablad\u2019s family frowned when she first told them she planned to make a living as a cheikha, singing about love, pain, and societal change to the melodies of her ancestors under the stage name \u201cThouria.\u201d",
      "Women like her are the stewards of one of Morocco\u2019s most cherished oral traditions: a form of folk singing known as aita, which means a \u201ccry\u201d or \u201clament\u201d in Arabic. From smoky bars and cabarets in Morocco\u2019s largest cities to the gatherings in the country\u2019s rural regions, they croon at weddings, festivals and private events and pub nights, hypnotizing audiences both humble and wealthy.",
      "But despite aita's position in Moroccan culture, the genre\u2019s popularity does not always translate into acceptance for those who perform it. Cheikha are often stigmatized, eroticized, and pushed to society\u2019s margins. That was once a fear for Moullablad, but she says her community in Sidi Yahya Zaer, a farming town on Morocco\u2019s Atlantic plains, has mostly accepted her.",
      "\u201cMy family did not agree at first and I used to suffer from society\u2019s judgment, but now everything is good,\u201d Moullablad said on the sidelines of a recent performance south of Morocco\u2019s capital, Rabat. \u201cI do it in order to earn money for my children.\u201d",
      "A form of sung poetry, aita has long explored themes of societal triumphs, ironies, and unspoken struggles, including those related to relationships and economic hardship. Cheikha don heavy stage makeup, silk caftans, and golden takchita belts as they sing about their community's agonies and triumphs. They sway their hips to amplify emotion, dancing seductively or cheerfully depending on the context.",
      "When Moullablad performs, men and women lean in as her voice softens, captivated as she climbs octaves into a full-throated howl. The beads wrapped around her sister Fatiha\u2019s belly shake as she dances. The band leader, another singer, backs her with his own poetry while a drummer keeps the beat, a guitarist strums, and a violinist drags his bow in sync.",
      "Those who come to hear them sing say cheikha can serve as a community's truth-tellers, singing about often unspoken dynamics related to marriage, agriculture or, historically, colonial resistance. Moullablad sings in Moroccan Arabic, embodying traditions specific to her community. But cheikha across the North African Kingdom also perform in the indigenous Amazigh language, adapting the music and lyrics to reflect their region.",
      "The art form has inspired contemporary acts like the electro-infused \u201cAita, Mon Amour\u201d and Kabareh Cheikhats, a troupe of male actors who pay homage, dress and sing in the tune of Morocco's most celebrated 20th century women folk singers. It is also the subject of Morocco\u2019s submission for this year\u2019s Academy Awards, \u201cEverybody Loves Touda,\u201d which follows a single mother who leaves her town in the Atlas Mountains to pursue her dream of singing in bars, cabarets, and hotels in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cI was always amazed by their strength and the power that they have toward people when they open their mouths. Whether they are modern or conservative people, they all stand up and get into a kind of trance like gospel,\u201d Nabil Ayouch, the film\u2019s director, said in an interview when the film premiered at the Marrakech Film Festival last year.",
      "Morocco\u2019s music scene is increasingly embracing Middle Eastern pop and rap by North African artists from throughout the diaspora. And rural communities are shrinking amid the country's rapid development and urbanization. But though the future of aita may seem uncertain, its musicians and listeners remain confident that it will endure.",
      "\u201cAita will not die because it is renewed by young people. Aita will remain in all times and is loved by old people and young people as well. It is developed and improved, but they preserve its origins,\u201d said Rachid Kadari, a Cheikh who also sings aita."

      "All eyes at the Grammy Awards were on whether the most-nominated artist in the history of the telecast would finally walk away with the coveted album of the year trophy. She did. \u201cWe finally saw it happen,\u201d host Trevor Noah said, almost in relief.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 winning for \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d capped a night that turned into a tribute to a suffering Los Angeles, with city firefighters chosen to reveal the winner of the last award and speeches offering words of encouragement for communities devastated. The Grammys almost veered into a telethon; $7 million was pledged from viewers of the show.",
      "It was also a telecast where the best new artist nominees like Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter were given plenty of time to show why there's a deep well of talent coming up. And there was a shock return for The Weeknd, who had been boycotting the Grammys.",
      "Here are some of the night\u2019s notable moments:",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga were right there, as were Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, but the honor of opening the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles was given to two local brothers deeply affected by the wildfires: Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith of the band Dawes.",
      "They lost one brother\u2019s home along with their childhood home, instruments and much else. They've advocated for victims, raised money and were included in the FireAid benefit concert on Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey truly epitomize the unique spirit that we are seeing in LA right now,\u201d host Trevor Noah said. \u201cWhat better way to start the Grammy Awards?\u201d",
      "Dawes then played Randy Newman's \u201cI Love L.A.\u201d surrounded by an all-star backing band: John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent.",
      "\u201cLook at these firefighters, ain\u2019t nothin like \u2018em nowhere,\u201d Taylor Goldsmith sang, altering the line: \u201cLook at these women/There ain\u2019t nothing like \u2019em nowhere.\u201d",
      "Doechii won the Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category. And, with her mother by her side, she had a strong message for young Black girls.",
      "\u201cI know that there's some Black girl out there, so many Black women out there, that are watching me right now, and I want to tell you: You can do it. Anything is possible. Anything is possible,\u201d she said.",
      "\"Don\u2019t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you, to tell you that you can\u2019t be here, that you\u2019re too dark, or that you\u2019re not smart enough, or that you\u2019re too dramatic, or you\u2019re too loud. You are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are, and I am a testimony right now. Good night!\u201d",
      "The win caps an astounding few years for the 26-year-old Floridian who mixes R&B, hip-hop, jazz, boundary-pushing sounds and samples, and adds theatricality. She playfully calls herself the \u201cswamp princess.\u201d",
      "Her 2024 mixtape, \u201dAlligator Bites Never Heal\u2033 went to No. 33 on the Billboard 200, No. 9 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop chart and No. 8 on the Top Rap Album chart.",
      "Her Grammy performance of \u201cCatfish\u201d and \u201cDenial Is a River\u201d was electric, with the singer-songwriter backed by over a dozen dancers in matching Thom Browne suits and she eventually stripped down to a white two-piece set.",
      "Chappell Roan was crowned best new artist and then used her speech to demand change in the music business.",
      "\u201cI told myself that if I ever won a Grammy and got to stand up here before the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a livable wage and health care, especially to developing artists,\u201d she said.",
      "Roan began her music career in 2015 when she signed with Atlantic Records, releasing several singles including \u201cPink Pony Club.\u201d In 2020, the label dropped her. She moved back to her hometown to work as a barista before releasing her debut full-length album.",
      "\u201cIt was devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and dehumanized,\u201d Roan said in her speech. \u201cRecord labels need to treat their artists as valuable employees with a livable wage and health insurance and protection.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Roan performed a rocking version of her \u201cPink Pony Club,\u201d joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys as she sang from atop a giant pink horse.",
      "Lady Gaga, accepting the trophy for best pop duo or group alongside Bruno Mars for their chart-topping collab, \u201cDie with a Smile,\u201d gave a shout-out to the trans community, targets of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love,\" Lady Gaga said.",
      "Not long after, Alicia Keys, being honored with The Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, also backed diversity and inclusion programs, another Trump target.",
      "\u201cThis is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices,\u201d said Keys. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen on this stage talented, hardworking people from different backgrounds with different points of view, and it changes the game. DEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift.\u201d",
      "The Grammy Awards had a powerful way to prove that they've changed. They got a surprise endorsement by The Weeknd, who was last on the Grammy stage in 2017.",
      "The pop superstar in 2020 slammed the Grammys, calling them \u201ccorrupt\u201d after he landed zero nominations despite a megahit album. \u201cYou owe me, my fans and the industry transparency,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Grammys CEO Harvey Mason jr., who started in his post in 2020, on Sunday said he understood the criticism and listed all the things the Academy has done to fix it.",
      "\u201cWe have completely re-made our membership, adding more than 3,000 women voting members. The Grammy electorate is now younger, nearly 40% people of color, and 66% of our members are new since we started our transformation,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the past few years, we have listened, we\u2019ve acted and we\u2019ve changed.\u201d",
      "Mason then introduced The Weeknd, who performed two tunes from his just-released album \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d \u2014 \u201cCry For Me\u201d and \u201cTimeless\u201d with special guest Playboi Carti. He wore a long druid's robe and the stage was smoky.",
      "Will Smith, hosting a tribute to the late Quincy Jones, marked his first appearance at a major awards show since since he slapped Chris Rock onstage at the Oscars in 2022.",
      "\u201cIn his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but I have to say, he changed mine forever. You probably wouldn\u2019t even know who Will Smith was if it wasn\u2019t for Quincy Jones,\" Smith said.",
      "Smith has been banned from film academy ceremonies for 10 years but the Grammys are a different beast. He made no mention of the infamous Slap.",
      "Smith has previously nabbed Grammy wins in the short form music video (\u201cWill 2K\u201d), best rap solo performance (\u201cGetting\u2019 Jiggy Wit It,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d), and best rap performance by a duo or group (\u201cSummertime\u201d as the Fresh Prince with DJ Jazzy Jeff).",

    "story": [
      "The New Jersey man charged with severely injuring author Salman Rushdie in a 2022 knife attack is standing trial in New York",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- In 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture before a live audience in western New York when a man ran towards him and plunged a knife into the author\u2019s hand as he raised it in self-defense.",
      "\u201cAfter that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere,\u201d Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. \u201cI feel my legs give way, and I fall.\u201d",
      "In the coming weeks, Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar.",
      "Jury selection got underway Tuesday. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault.",
      "Under different circumstances, Rushdie\u2019s book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his hand permanently damaged.",
      "But \u201cthis isn\u2019t a back alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley,\u201d said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. \u201cThis is something that was recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people.\u201d",
      "Jurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as photos and documentation, and an estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand. Judge David Foley said once jury selection is complete, the trial would take up to a week and a half.",
      "Matar\u2019s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, has not explained how he plans to defend his client and has clapped back at critics who question why Matar did not take a plea deal.",
      "\u201cThat's not what this is about. It's about due process,\" Barone said. \u201cIt's about receiving a fair trial ... If someone wants to exercise those rights, they're entitled to do that.\"",
      "In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege that Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization\u2019s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death. A separate trial on the federal charges \u2014 terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2014 will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.",
      "Foley asked potential jurors Tuesday whether they could fairly consider a case involving someone of Muslim descent or with strong religious beliefs. All indicated they could.",
      "But finding jurors who have not already formed an opinion was proving harder.",
      "Nearly all of the 27 men and women being screened Tuesday said they knew about what happened to Rushdie, either from news reports or acquaintances, and several said they had formed opinions that are unlikely to change based on what they hear at trial",
      "Matar's attorney sought unsuccessfully to move the trial out of Chautauqua County last year, citing pretrial publicity and potential prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent among the small rural county's mostly white residents.",
      "Rushdie spent years in hiding after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.",
      "But jurors in the Chautauqua County case are unlikely to hear about the fatwa, according to Schmidt. He has said he doesn\u2019t anticipate needing to show Matar\u2019s possible motive to get a conviction on the state charges.",
      "\u201cFrom my standpoint, this is a localized event. It\u2019s a stabbing event. It\u2019s fairly straightforward,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a need to get into motive evidence, whether that\u2019s applicable or not applicable and what that consists of. I\u2019d like to avoid all of that.\u201d",
      "Barone, the defense attorney, said jurors should be screened for prejudice nonetheless, given the discussions of the fatwa during previous court proceedings.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve talked about the reason why this alleged crime supposedly occurred was because of this book involving Muslims, all that. So it\u2019s kind of like the barn door\u2019s been opened,\u201d he said.",
      "Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. Rushdie is a native of India who lived for years in London. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016.",
      "Matar has been held without bail since his arrest after being subdued by onlookers who rushed the amphitheater stage. The event\u2019s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded."

    "story": [
      "Dairy cattle in Nevada have been infected with a new type of bird flu that's different from the version that has spread in herds since last year",
      "Dairy cattle in Nevada have been infected with a new type of bird flu that's different from the version that has spread in U.S. herds since last year, Agriculture Department officials said Wednesday.",
      "The detection indicates that distinct forms of the virus known as Type A H5N1 have spilled over from wild birds into cattle at least twice. Experts said it raises new questions about wider spread and the difficulty of controlling infections in animals and the people who work closely with them.",
      "\u201cI always thought one bird-to-cow transmission was a very rare event. Seems that may not be the case,\u201d said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.",
      "A version of the H5N1 bird flu virus known as B3.13 was confirmed in March after being introduced to cattle in late 2023, scientists said. It has infected more than 950 herds in 16 states. The new version, known as D1.1, was confirmed in Nevada cattle on Friday, according to USDA. It was detected in milk collected as part of a surveillance program launched in December.",
      "\u201cNow we know why it's really important to test and continue testing,\u201d said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, who helped identify the first spillover.",
      "The D1.1 version of the virus was the type linked to the first U.S. death tied to bird flu and a severe illness in Canada. A person in Louisiana died in January after developing severe respiratory symptoms following contact with wild and backyard birds. In British Columbia, a teen girl was hospitalized for months with a virus traced to poultry.",
      "At least 67 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly those who work closely with dairy or cattle, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "USDA officials said they would post genetic sequences and other information about the new form of the virus to a public repository later this week. Scientists said that would be key to understanding whether the spillover was a recent event or whether the virus has been circulating, perhaps widely, for longer.",
      "\u201cIf this turns out to have been something that crossed into cattle a couple months ago, a couple months is a long time not to detect it,\u201d said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona who has studied the H5N1 virus in cattle.",
      "He added that it's important for federal officials to share promptly information about a virus that has the potential to trigger a pandemic that could \u201cmake COVID seem like a walk in the park.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's a vital part of national security, global security, the well-being of people, of animals and of businesses in the U.S.,\u201d Worobey added.",

      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force",
      "NEW YORK -- They snooze in parking garages, on side streets before the afternoon school run, in nap pods rented by the hour or stretched out in bed while working from home.",
      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force. Inspired by famous power nappers Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein, today's committed nap-takers often sneak in short rest breaks because they think the practice will improve their cognitive performance but still carries a stigma.",
      "Multiple studies have extolled the benefits of napping, such as enhanced memory and focus. A mid-afternoon siesta is the norm in parts of Spain and Italy. In China and Japan, nodding off is encouraged since working to the point of exhaustion is seen as a display of dedication, according to a study in the journal Sleep.",
      "Yet it's hard to catch a few z's during regular business hours in the United States, where people who nap can be viewed as lazy. The federal government even bans sleeping in its buildings while at work, except in rare circumstances.",
      "Individuals who are willing and able to challenge the status quo are becoming less hesitant to describe the payoffs of taking a dose of microsleep. Marvin Stockwell, the founder of PR firm Champion the Cause, takes short naps several times a week.",
      "\u201cThey rejuvenate me in a way that I\u2019m exponentially more useful and constructive and creative on the other side of a nap than I am when I\u2019m forcing myself to gut through being tired,\u201d Stockwell said.",
      "Sleep is as important to good health as diet and exercise, but too many people don\u2019t get enough of it, according to James Rowley, program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at Rush University Medical Center.",
      "\u201cA lot of it has to do with electronics. It used to be TVs, but now cellphones are probably the biggest culprit. People just take them to bed with them and watch,\u201d Rowley said.\u201d",
      "Napping isn\u2019t common in academia, where there\u2019s constant pressure to publish, but University of Southern California lecturer Julianna Kirschner fits in daytime naps when she can. Kirschner studies social media, which she says is designed to deliver a dopamine rush to the brain. Viewers lose track of time on the platforms, interrupting sleep. Kirschner says she isn\u2019t immune to this problem \u2014 hence, her occasional need to nap.",
      "The key to effective napping is to keep the snooze sessions short, Rowley said. Short naps can be restorative and are more likely to leave you more alert, he said.",
      "\u201cMost people don\u2019t realize naps should be in the 15- to 20-minute range,\u201d Rowley said. \u201cAnything longer, and you can have problems with sleep inertia, difficulty waking up, and you\u2019re groggy.\u201d",
      "Individuals who find themselves consistently relying on naps to make up for inadequate sleep should probably also examine their bedtime habits, he said.",
      "Mid-afternoon is the ideal time for a nap because it coincides with a natural circadian dip, while napping after 6 p.m. may interfere with nocturnal sleep for those who work during daylight hours, said Michael Chee, director of the Centre for Sleep and Cognition at the National University of Singapore.",
      "\u201cAny duration of nap, you will feel recharged. It\u2019s a relief valve. There are clear cognitive benefits,\u201d Chee said.",
      "A review of napping studies suggests that 30 minutes is the optimal nap length in terms of practicality and benefits, said Ruth Leong, a research fellow at the Singapore center.",
      "\u201cWhen people nap for too long, it may not be a sustainable practice, and also, really long naps that cross the two-hour mark affect nighttime sleep,\u201d Leong said.",
      "Experts recommend setting an alarm for 20 to 30 minutes, which gives nappers a few minutes to fall asleep.",
      "But even a six-minute nap can be restorative and improve learning, said Valentin Dragoi, scientific director of the Center for Neural Systems Restoration, a research and treatment facility run by Houston Methodist hospital and Rice University.",
      "While workplace dozing is uncommon in the U.S., some companies and managers encourage it. Will Bryk, founder of AI search startup Exa, swears by 20-minute power naps and ordered two sleeping pods for employees to use in his company's San Francisco office.",
      "Ice cream maker Ben & Jerry\u2019s has had a nap room in its Vermont headquarters for a couple of decades, and a handful of employees use it, company spokesman Sean Greenwood said. \u201cEmployees who feel taken care of are much more likely to use this responsibly,\" he said.",
      "Arianna Huffington, the celebrity author who co-founded the news website Huffington Post, became an advocate of a good night\u2019s sleep and occasional naps after she collapsed from exhaustion in 2007. She installed a nap room at her former company, now called HuffPo, and at Thrive Global, a wellness technology company where she serves as founder and CEO.",
      "\u201cIf people have been up all night because of a sick child or a delayed flight, if they have the opportunity to nap, ... then they will be much more productive and creative for the rest of the day instead of dragging themselves or trying to boost their energy through multiple coffees or cinnamon buns,\u201d Huffington said in an email.",
      "Kirsten Perez, 33, is a devoted napper. She used to use her lunch break at work to catch a few winks in her car. When she got her own office, she closed the door for a siesta while sitting at her desk.",
      "Nowadays, working from home as a marketing manager at Nvidia, the Atlanta resident usually takes her daily nap in bed. She sets an alarm for 15 minutes, falls asleep within a minute and wakes up 30 seconds before the alarm rings.",
      "\u201cI can tell when my reasoning, my mood are dropping, just kind of feeling the drag of the day,\u201d Perez said. In those situations, she asks herself, \u201c\u2018Do I have a chunk of time in the next hour or so?\u2019 And then I\u2019ll figure out when I can find 15 minutes and find myself horizontal.\u201d",
      "Naps are accepted and even a necessity in some occupations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages naps for nurses working night shifts. But many nurses can't sleep at the hospitals where they work because they're too busy and aren't given access to beds.",
      "Nurses \"regularly struggle to have sufficient time to use the bathroom or go outside for fresh air, no less take a nap,\" Michelle Morris, spokesperson for the National Nurses United union, said.",
      "Some companies are trying to fill the void. Inspired by his mother who worked as a nurse, Neil Wong founded Nap York, which offers sleeping pods in Manhattan and Queens that can be rented for about $27 an hour.",
      "His regular customers include super-commuters, UPS drivers, a security guard who works two full-time jobs, and doctors who work at nearby hospitals. Nap York also gives half-off prices to essential workers such as police officers, firefighters and emergency medical service personnel.",
      "\u201cIn this society, you really only have two place to sleep: you have your bed at home and you have a hotel room you can probably get for 100 bucks,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no third space that\u2019s quiet, that provides some privacy, where you can also rest.\u201d",

      "Ugandan authorities have begun a clinical trial of a vaccine against the Sudan strain of Ebola that has killed one person in the outbreak declared last week",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Ugandan authorities on Monday began a clinical trial of a vaccine against the Sudan strain of Ebola that has killed one person in the outbreak declared last week.",
      "Health workers and others exposed to the Ebola strain are being targeted in the study, which began four days after Uganda announced the death of a nurse in the capital, Kampala. Two more cases were confirmed on Monday in relatives of the first victim.",
      "Officials are investigating the source of the outbreak. Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding.",
      "Responding to this outbreak could prove difficult because Kampala has a highly mobile population of about 4 million. The nurse who died had sought treatment at a hospital just outside the capital and later traveled to Mbale in the country\u2019s east, where he was admitted to a public hospital. Health authorities said he also sought the services of a traditional healer.",
      "At least 234 contacts in this outbreak have been identified, according to the Ministry of Health.",
      "Health authorities have access to more than 2,000 doses of a candidate vaccine against the Sudan strain. IAVI provided the vaccine.",
      "The trial \u201cmarks a major milestone in public health emergency response and demonstrates the power of collaboration for global health security,\u201d Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO director for Africa, said in a statement.",
      "This is the first Ebola outbreak since the Trump administration's decision last week to withdraw from the U.N. health agency, and since Trump's order for a freeze on foreign assistance.",
      "Uganda has had multiple Ebola outbreaks, including one in 2000 that killed hundreds. Tracing contacts is key to stemming the spread of Ebola, which manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever.",
      "A trial vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV, used to vaccinate 3,000 people at risk of infection during an outbreak of the Zaire strain of Ebola in eastern Congo between 2018 and 2020, proved effective in containing the spread of the disease there.",
      "The confirmation of Ebola in Uganda is the latest in a series of outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the east African region. Tanzania declared an outbreak of the Ebola-like Marburg disease last month, and Rwanda in December announced that its own outbreak of Marburg was over.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know the natural reservoir of Ebola, but they suspect the first person infected in an outbreak acquired the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat.",
      "Ebola was discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named."

      "NEW YORK -- New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday told hospitals that they would be violating state law if they stop offering gender-affirming care for people under age 19 in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at curtailing federal funding for such treatments.",
      "In a letter, James, a Democrat, told health care facilities that refusing to provide the treatments would violate New York's anti-discrimination laws.",
      "\"Regardless of the availability of federal funding, we write to further remind you of your obligations to comply with New York State laws,\" her letter reads.",
      "Trump, a Republican, last week signed an executive order that directed agencies to take steps to make sure that hospitals receiving federal research and education grants \u201cend the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\u201d The language in the order \u2014 using words such as \u201cmaiming,\u201d \u201csterilizing\u201d and \u201cmutilation\u201d \u2014 contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States.",
      "The letter from James came as some hospitals in Colorado, Virginia and Washington, D.C., said they were pausing gender-affirming treatments for young people while administrators evaluate the order. The White House on Monday released a statement that said the executive order was \u201calready having its intended effect.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Greater New York Hospital Association said they were in close contact with member hospitals about the gender-affirming care executive order.",
      "\u201cWe are collaboratively working through every aspect of the EO to determine its legal and clinical implications. That work is ongoing,\u201d Brian Conway said in an email.",
      "Gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth is not common but such treatments have been the subject of fierce political debate. Fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents in the U.S. with commercial insurance received puberty blockers or hormones during a recent five-year period, according to a new study."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's effort to ban federal funding for gender-affirming care for young people is facing a legal challenge",
      "Seven families with transgender or nonbinary children filed a lawsuit Tuesday over President Donald Trump's executive orders to narrowly define the sexes and halt federal support for gender-affirming health care for transgender people under age 19.",
      "PFLAG, a national group for family of LGBTQ+ people; and GLMA, a doctors organization, are also plaintiffs in the court challenge in a Baltimore federal court.",
      "It comes one week after Trump signed an order calling for the federal government to stop funding the medical care through federal government-run health insurance programs including Medicaid and TRICARE.",
      "Kristen Chapman, the mother of one of the plaintiffs in the case, said her family moved to Richmond, Virginia, from Tennessee in 2023 because of a ban on gender-affirming care in their home state. Her 17-year-old daughter, Willow, had an initial appointment scheduled for last week with a new provider who would accept Medicaid. But Trump signed his order the day before and the hospital said it could not provide care.",
      "\u201cI thought Virginia would be a safe place for me and my daughter,\u201d Kristen Chapman said in a statement. \"Instead, I am heartbroken, tired, and scared.\u201d",
      "She's not the only one, Brian Bond, the CEO of PFLAG, said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cWe are receiving a drumbeat of calls from parents whose kids' care is being canceled.\u201d",
      "The ACLU and Lambda Legal, who are representing the plaintiffs, want a judge to put the order on hold. In a court filing Tuesday, they said Trump's executive orders are \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional\u201d because they seek to withhold federal funds previously authorized by Congress and because they violate antidiscrimination laws. The challenge also says that the order infringes on the rights of parents.",
      "Like legal challenges to state bans on gender-affirming care, they also argue that the policy discriminates because it does not prohibit federal funds for the same treatments when they're not used for gender transition.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "Some health providers immediately paused providing the coverage while they assess how the order affects them. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has repeatedly battled Trump in court, told hospitals in her state Monday that it would violate the law to stop offering gender-affirming care to people under 19.",
      "Josh Block, an ACLU lawyer on the case, said that medical providers should continue gender-affirming care for people under 19. \u201cIt should not take either a protest, a letter from the attorney general or a TRO,\u201d or temporary restraining order from the court for them to do so.",
      "Trump's approach on transgender policy represents an abrupt change from the Biden administration, which sought to explicitly extend civil rights protections to transgender people.",
      "Trump has used strong language, asserting in the order on gender-affirming care that \"medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child\u2019s sex.\u201d",
      "Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA, the doctors group in the legal challenge, said there are established medical standards for caring for transgender youth. \u201cNow, an extreme political agenda is trying to overrule that expertise, putting young people and their providers in danger,\" Sheldon said in a statement. \"We are confident that the law, science, and history are on our side.\u201d",
      "In addition to the orders on health care access and defining the sexes as unchangeable, Trump has also signed orders that open the door to banning transgender people from military service and set up new rules about how schools can teach about gender.",
      "Legal challenges have already been filed on the military order and a plan to move transgender women in federal prisons to men's facilities. Others are expected to be filed, just as there have been challenges to a variety of Trump's policies.",
      "Researchers have found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents receive the care, which includes treatments such as puberty blockers, hormone treatments and surgeries \u2014 though surgery is rare for children.",
      "As transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance in some ways, there's been vehement pushback. At least 26 states have passed laws to restrict or ban the care for minors. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments last year but has not yet ruled on whether Tennessee's ban on the care is constitutional.",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has asked state legislators to double their spending to date on Hurricane Helene recovery and approve it now",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein asked state legislators Monday to roughly double their spending so far on recovery from Hurricane Helene, warning that waiting will cause more business closings, housing construction delays and students falling behind.",
      "Speaking in a mountain county hit by the historic flooding, the new Democratic governor said he wants his $1.07 billion request enacted now by the Republican-controlled General Assembly \u2014 rather than wait for the two-year budget that starts in July, for which he'll make an additional Helene appeal.",
      "At a news conference at a food bank in Mills River, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) west of Raleigh, Stein said the funds are urgently needed in the first half of the year \u201cso that people can get their lives back together.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we do not act, some businesses will not be here in the summer, and we will miss an entire building season before the winter weather comes again,\u201d he warned, calling the funds a high priority.",
      "The largest chunks of his proposal, which contains no tax increases, would fund grants for struggling businesses; help repair and rebuild homes; clean up farm debris; fix private bridges and roads; and replace revenues spent or lost by local governments. There's also money for summer school in districts that lost at least 15 instructional days shortly after Helene's rampage last September.",
      "\u201cWe can ensure that our students are set up for long-term academic success.,\u201d Stein said. \u201cAll of these components are necessary to building a safer, stronger and more resilient western North Carolina, and they are needed now.\u201d",
      "The state legislature already appropriated last fall well over $900 million for relief and rebuilding efforts and earmarked a couple of hundred million more for that purpose in the future. New House Speaker Destin Hall has said getting bipartisan early-session Helene funding bill to Stein's desk was a top priority.",
      "Advancing Monday's package could provide an early test for Stein, who was sworn in last month, in his efforts to find consensus with Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger. While Republicans control both chambers, they are one seat short of a veto-proof majority.",
      "GOP Rep. Jake Johnson of Polk County, who served on a bipartisan Helene advisory committee organized by Stein last year, spoke at the news conference with an optimistic tone.",
      "\u201cWe will start reviewing the governor\u2019s proposed budget and figuring out how we can get these dollars to people who need them the most right now,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Berger spokesperson Lauren Horsch said Monday that the Senate is reviewing Stein\u2019s proposal and anticipates considering Helene legislation in the coming weeks. Even with the money already put toward the recovery, Horsch added, \u201cthere is still more we can do.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported over 100 deaths from Helene with 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads damaged. The state budget office estimated that Helene caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "Helene made landfall last Sept. 26 in Florida\u2019s Big Bend and swept far inland, upending life throughout the Southeast. Officials have warned that rebuilding from the widespread loss of homes and property would be lengthy and difficult.",
      "Stein's request to spend money currently sitting in two reserves emphasizes speed.",
      "The $150 million sought for a home reconstruction, repair and buyout program is designed so such work can begin immediately while awaiting the distribution from Washington of similar housing assistance, which could take a year. The state program could assist at least 225 of 5,100 homes estimated to need rebuilding, Stein\u2019s request says.",
      "Stein also wants $150 million for two business grant programs designed to provide up to $75,000 to companies that suffered significant sales and economic losses, it physical damages.",
      "Stein said on Monday that \u201ctaking on additional business debt is simply not the answer for small businesses that are already struggling.\u201d",
      "In a special session last week, Tennessee lawmakers approved Gov. Bill Lee\u2019s $470 million package offering further aid for communities ravaged by Helene in the northeast part of that state. The package will help local governments cover loan interest on recovery costs, fuel agricultural and business recovery, fund disaster-related unemployment aid, and pay for rebuilding a badly damaged high school.",

      "GOMA, Congo -- Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma, a major city in eastern Congo, as fighting rages on between government forces and the Rwanda-backed rebels who seized the city of around 2 million people.",
      "\u201cThey will get infected before we can treat them all,\u201d said Florence Douet, an operating room nurse at Bethesda Hospital, as she attended to patients with varying degrees of injuries.",
      "Since the start of the M23 rebels' offensive on Goma on Jan. 26, more than 700 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 have been wounded in the city and its vicinity, officials say. Bethesda Hospital alone said it receives more than 100 new patients each day, overstretching its capacity of 250 beds.",
      "Bethesda is one of several hospitals in Goma that The Associated Press visited that has inadequate personnel and supplies. The city hosts many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced by the conflict, which is one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "As more people arrived at the hospitals with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, many were forced to share beds while others lay on the floor, writhing in pain as they waited for medical attention.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m experiencing this,\" said Patrick Bagamuhunda, who was wounded in the fighting. \u201cThis war has caused a lot of damage, but at least we are still breathing.\u201d",
      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma before withdrawing under international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "Unlike in 2012, the rebels say they now plan to march to Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) away, describing the country as a failed state under President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi.",
      "The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia group. Rwanda said the group is \"fully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges.",
      "Medical workers at Kyeshero Hospital in Goma say they are treating an increasing number of patients with bullet wounds.",
      "\"We removed 48 bullets yesterday,\u201d Johnny Kasangati, a surgeon, said Friday as he examined a patient under a tent.",
      "Kyeshero is also severely overcrowded, hitting more than 200% of its capacity on some days, according to Joseph Amadomon Sagara, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which runs the hospital.",
      "In the past, hospitals in Goma could transport wounded patients by boat to South Kivu's main Bukavu city, 180 kilometers (111 miles) to the south, but transport across Lake Kivu was suspended during the rebellion and roads have been mostly cut.",
      "The fighting in and around Goma has also disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages in medical supplies that aid groups rely on. Some of it previously entered the city through its international airport, which is now under rebel control.",
      "\u201cGoma was cut off from the world. It was a total blackout,\" said Virginie Napolitano, Goma's emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.",
      "The aid group's stockpiles, along with those of other groups, have been looted.",
      "\"We\u2019re getting by with what we had in the cabinets, but I don\u2019t know for how long,\u201d Napolitano said.",
      "Congo's government has confirmed 773 deaths and 2,880 injured persons at morgues and hospitals. The toll could be higher, it said, citing fears of finding mass graves and more bodies.",
      "The Maternit\u00e9 de la Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Goma was among those struggling to find space for the dead.",
      "\u201cWe had 66 bodies here. Fifty-six were transferred to the provincial hospital, where the morgue has more space than ours,\" said Jules Kafitiye, the hospital's medical director.",
      "\"We need to avoid decomposition due to disease,\u201d he added, pointing to a tent where bodies were being stored.",
      "Scores of bodies lay on streets and in hospitals in Goma after the city's capture, raising fears of disease outbreaks in the region, which is also facing mpox and cholera outbreaks.",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has ordered state employees back to their offices full-time starting next month.",
      "In an executive order issued Tuesday, DeWine required all permanent employees of state agencies, boards and commissions to resume five-day, in-office work weeks no later than March 17. He said the move will allow the state to best serve the public and to make best use of its remaining office space. Both are in the best interests of Ohio citizens, he wrote.",
      "The return date set by DeWine falls almost five years to the day after the state declared an emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 9, 2020, and allowed certain employees to work remotely.",
      "Many of those workers either returned to their offices full-time or on a hybrid basis starting in June 2021, when the emergency was lifted.",
      "Tuesday's order requires virtually all employees to now return. It allows agencies to grant exceptions in cases where some or all of their real estate portfolios have been eliminated. Lease terminations and space reallocations that resulted from the coronavirus pandemic saved Ohio taxpayers millions of dollars, the order says.",
      "According to the document, a majority of Ohio's state employees actually never worked remotely, due to the nature of their work at state hospitals, prisons, law enforcement agencies or in other jobs requiring a physical presence.",
      "DeWine's mandate comes as some major Columbus employers, including American Electric Power and JPMorganChase, also have required a return to five-day work weeks in March. Republican President Donald Trump also is requiring federal workers to return full-time to offices, an order that's as part of an unprecedented series of steps aimed at shrinking the federal government."

      "NEW YORK -- Black women in the U.S. died at a rate nearly 3.5 times higher than white women around the time of childbirth in 2023, as maternal mortality fell below prepandemic levels overall but racial gaps widened, according to federal health data released Wednesday.",
      "In 2021 and 2022, the maternal death rate for Black women was about 2.6 times higher than white women.",
      "The data suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic, at its peak, impacted all pregnant women. But \u201conce we went back to \u2018usual activities,\u2019 then the impact of systemic racism and unequal access (to medical care) ... came right back into place,\u201d said Dr. Amanda Williams, interim medical director for the March of Dimes.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's report Wednesday on the 2023 deaths was drawn from death certificates. The CDC counts women who died while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth. Accidental deaths are excluded.",
      "The report found:",
      "\u2014 The maternal death rate for white women dropped from 19 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022 to 14.5 per 100,000 in 2023.",
      "\u2014 The rate for Black women went from 49.5 to a little above 50, though the report says that increase was not statistically significant.",

      "\u2014 The rate for Asian Americans fell from about 13 to about 11.",

      "Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes of maternal deaths.",
      "Among those infections is COVID-19. The coronavirus and its complications proved dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "COVID-19\u2019s overall impact on pregnancies declined as the pandemic subsided and as hospitals and birthing centers returned to normal operations.",
      "Also, the federal Medicaid program expanded to cover postpartum care for up to 12 months, instead of just seven weeks. That helped more moms recover and made them healthier for the next time they tried to have a baby, Williams said.",
      "The number of maternal deaths is also tied to the number of pregnancies. U.S. births have been declining, and fewer pregnancies contributes to fewer pregnancy-related deaths, noted Eugene Declercq, a maternal deaths researcher at Boston University.",

      "Shanon and William Schmidtknecht, of Poynette, filed their lawsuit in federal court in Milwaukee on Jan. 21, a year to the day that their son Cole died at age 22.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Cole Schmidtknecht suffered from asthma all his life. He managed it with daily doses of the medication Advair Diskus and its generic equivalents, which he ingested through an inhaler.",
      "He stopped at a Walgreens pharmacy in Appleton on Jan. 10, 2024, to refill his prescription and was told the cost had jumped from $66 to $539 out-of-pocket. Unable to afford the new cost, he left the pharmacy without the medication. He tried to manage his condition with his rescue inhaler but suffered a fatal asthma attack days later, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The Schmidtknechts allege that pharmacy benefits management company OptumRX violated Wisconsin law by raising the cost of the medication without a valid medical reason and failing to provide 30 days' advance notice of drug price increases.",
      "Pharmacy benefits managers act as intermediaries between health insurance companies, prescription drug companies and pharmacies. Optum Rx services prescription claims for more than 66 million people across the United States, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the Walgreens pharmacy staffers failed to offer Cole any workarounds to obtain his usual medication. They told him there were no cheaper alternatives or generic medications available, they didn't contact OptumRx to request an exception on Cole's behalf, and they didn't ask Cole's doctor to request an exception for him, his parents contend.",
      "The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.",
      "\u201cThe conduct of both OptumRx and Walgreens was deplorable,\u201d one of the family's attorneys, Michael Trunk, said in a statement. \u201cThe evidence in this case will show that both OptumRx and Walgreens put profits first, and are directly responsible for Cole\u2019s death.\"",
      "OptumRx spokespeople didn't immediately reply to Wednesday messages seeking comment. In a statement last April extending sympathy to the family, the company said that a review of Cole's claims showed that on the day he visited the pharmacy, he did buy a different asthma medication, generic Albuterol, for a $5 co-pay on Jan. 10 \u2014 a medication that it says he also obtained in October 2023. His case was handled \u201cconsistent with industry practice and the patient's insurance plan design,\u201d the company said.",
      "Trunk, though, said Wednesday that the $5 generic prescription Cole filled was for his rescue inhaler, not the Advair Diskus inhaler that he took daily. He said Cole was not able to fill his Advair Diskus prescription because it had suddenly become too expensive.",
      "Walgreens officials didn't immediately respond to a Wednesday email seeking comment on the lawsuit."

      "For 2024-2025, the U.S. is WHO\u2019s biggest donor by far, putting in an estimated $988 million, roughly 14% of WHO\u2019s $6.9 billion budget.",

      "The document said U.S. funding \u201cprovides the backbone of many of WHO's large-scale emergency operations,\u201d covering up to 40%.

He added the current rate of spending is \u201csomething we're not going to do,\" according to a recording obtained by the AP.",

In the order, the president said WHO mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic that began in China, failed to adopt needed reforms and that U.S. membership required \u201cunfairly onerous payments.\"",
      "Tedros said WHO alerted the world in January 2020 about the potential dangers of the coronavirus and has made dozens of reforms since \u2014 including efforts to expand its donor base.",

      "\u201cBringing the U.S. back will be very important,\" he told meeting attendees. \"And on that, I think all of you can play a role.\u201d",

      "Syria joined the OPCW in 2013 to ward off the threat of airstrikes in response to a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus, and Assad denied using chemical weapons. Last year, the organization also found the Islamic State group had used mustard gas against the town of Marea.",
      "The delegation, which was set to meet with President Ahmed al-Sharaa and Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani, includes technical experts who hope to make contact with their Syrian counterparts. Since the overthrow of the Assad government, the Qatari embassy in The Hague has acted as the intermediary between the new leadership and the OPCW.",
      "The fate of the country\u2019s stockpile of toxic chemicals spurred an emergency meeting by the OPCW days after Assad was overthrown in a lightning rebel offensive in December. The organization told Syria\u2019s new rulers that they must comply with rules to safeguard and destroy dangerous substances, such as chlorine gas.",
      "OPCW officials also voiced concerns that a barrage of Israeli airstrikes that hit military sites of the former Syrian army may have led to contamination with toxic substances or destruction of evidence.",
      "The OPCW\u2019s 193 member states are required to disclose their chemical weapons programs and dismantle them. The organization, created in 1997 by the Chemical Weapons Convention, seeks to eliminate all chemical weapons. In 2013, it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its work.",
      "The organization initially made some progress in cataloging Syria\u2019s stockpile of restricted chemicals, including sarin and chlorine, but a deteriorating relationship with the Assad government made further inspections impossible. Saturday\u2019s visit is the first time OPCW officials have been to Syria since 2022.",

      "The far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, or AfD, is in second place in recent polls and has prompted widespread protests across the country before voters cast their ballots on Feb. 23.",
      "The protest at Munich's Theresienwiese \u2014 where Oktoberfest takes place each year \u2014 brought a significantly larger crowd than expected, according to the German dpa news agency. The event's organizer estimated the crowd could be up to 320,000 people, many of whom carried signs against the AfD with slogans like, \u201cRacism and hatred is not an alternative.\"",
      "The protest was supported by activist groups as well as the Munich Film Festival, churches and Munich soccer clubs FC Bayern and TSV 1860, among others. Police told dpa that the demonstration was peaceful.",
      "Similar protests attracted large crowds on Saturday in Hanover, Rostock, and elsewhere in Germany, mirroring other demonstrations that have occurred across the country in recent weeks.",
      "Last month, at Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg Gate, a huge crowd blew whistles, sang anti-fascist songs and carried banners denouncing AfD. Activists said they hoped the rally also would draw attention to other far-right parties in Europe and the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Demonstrators have recently also opposed Friedrich Merz, the center-right leader and front-runner in the upcoming election, and his Christian Democrats for last month sending to parliament proposals for tough new migration rules that received AfD's backing.",
      "The protesters say Merz and his party broke Germany\u2019s unwritten post-Nazi promise by all democratic parties to never pass any rule or resolution in parliament with the support of far-right, nationalist parties like the AfD. Merz insists his position is unchanged and that he didn\u2019t and won\u2019t work with the party.",
      "The 12-year-old AfD entered the national parliament in 2017, benefiting from then-Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2019s decision two years earlier to allow large numbers of migrants into the country."

      "Nearly three years after President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, his troops are making steady progress on the battlefield",
      "Nearly three years after President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, his troops are making steady progress on the battlefield. Kyiv is grappling with shortages of men and weapons. And the new U.S. president could soon halt Ukraine's massive supply of military aid.",
      "Putin is closer than ever to achieving his objectives in the battle-weary country, with little incentive to come to the negotiating table, no matter how much U.S. President Donald Trump might cajole or threaten him, according to Russian and Western experts interviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "Both are signaling discussions on Ukraine -\u2013 by phone or in person -\u2013 using flattery and threats.",
      "Putin said Trump was \u201cclever and pragmatic,\u201d and even parroted his false claims of having won the 2020 election. Trump\u2019s opening gambit was to call Putin \u201csmart\u201d and to threaten Russia with tariffs and oil price cuts, which the Kremlin brushed off.",
      "Trump boasted during the campaign he could end the war in 24 hours, which later became six months. He's indicated the U.S. is talking to Russia about Ukraine without Kyiv\u2019s input, saying his administration already had \u201cvery serious\u201d discussions.",
      "He suggested he and Putin could soon take \u201csignificant\u201d action toward ending the war, in which Russia is suffering heavy casualties daily while its economy endures stiff Western sanctions, inflation and a serious labor shortage.",
      "But the economy has not collapsed, and because Putin has unleashed the harshest crackdown on dissent since Soviet times, he faces no domestic pressure to end the war.",
      "\u201cIn the West, the idea came from somewhere that it\u2019s important to Putin to reach an agreement and end things. This is not the case,\u201d said Fyodor Lukyanov, who hosted a forum with Putin in November and heads Moscow's Council for Foreign and Defense policies.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Putin wants to deal directly with Trump, cutting out Kyiv. That runs counter to the Biden administration's position that echoed Zelenskyy's call of \u201cNothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\"",
      "\u201cWe cannot let someone decide something for us,\u201d Zelenskyy told AP, saying Russia wants the \u201cdestruction of Ukrainian freedom and independence.\u201d",
      "He suggested any such peace deal would send the dangerous signal that adventurism pays to authoritarian leaders in China, North Korea and Iran.",
      "Putin appears to expect Trump to undermine European resolve on Ukraine. Likening Europe's leaders to Trump's lapdogs, he said Sunday they will soon be \u201csitting obediently at their master\u2019s feet and sweetly wagging their tails\u201d as the U.S. president quickly brings order with his \u201dcharacter and persistence.\"",
      "Trump boasts of his deal-making prowess but Putin will not easily surrender what he considers Russia\u2019s ancestral lands in Ukraine or squander a chance to punish the West and undermine its alliances and security by forcing Kyiv into a policy of neutrality.",
      "Trump may want a legacy as a peacemaker, but \u201chistory won\u2019t look kindly on him if he\u2019s the man who gives this all away,\u201d said Sir Kim Darroch, British ambassador to the U.S. from 2016-19. Former NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu said a deal favoring Moscow would send a message of \"American weakness.\u201d",
      "Trump and Putin last met in Helsinki in 2018 when there was \u201cmutual respect\u201d between them, said former Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, the summit host. But they are \u201cnot very similar,\u201d he added, with Putin a \u201csystematic\u201d thinker while Trump acts like a businessman making \u201cprompt\u201d decisions.",
      "That could cause a clash because Trump wants a quick resolution to the war while Putin seeks a slower one that strengthens his military position and weakens both Kyiv and the West's political will.",
      "Zelenskyy told AP that Putin \"does not want to negotiate. He will sabotage it.\u201d Indeed, Putin has already raised obstacles, including legal hurdles and claimed Zelenskyy has lost his legitimacy as president.",
      "Putin hopes Trump will \u201cget bored\u201d or distracted with another issue, said Boris Bondarev, a former Russian diplomat in Geneva who quit his post after the invasion.",
      "Russian experts point to Trump's first term when they said Putin realized such meetings achieved little.",
      "One was a public relations victory for Moscow in Helsinki where Trump sided with Putin instead of his own intelligence agencies on whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election. Another was in Singapore in 2019 with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when he failed to reach a deal to halt Pyongyang's nuclear program.",
      "The Kremlin last year said\u202f a draft peace agreement \u202fthat Russia and Ukraine negotiated in Istanbul early in the conflict \u2014 but which Kyiv rejected \u2014 could be the basis for talks.",
      "It demanded Ukraine's neutrality, stipulated NATO deny it membership, put limits on Kyiv\u2019s armed forces and delayed talks on the status of four Russian-occupied regions that Moscow later annexed illegally.\u202f Moscow also dismissed\u202f demands to withdraw its troops, pay compensation to Ukraine and face an international tribunal for its action.",
      "Putin hasn\u2019t indicated he will budge but said \u201cif there is a desire to negotiate and find a compromise solution, let anyone conduct these negotiations.\u201d",
      "\u201cEngagement is not the same as negotiation,\u201d said Sir Laurie Bristow, British ambassador to Russia from 2016-20, describing Russia's strategy as \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is mine. And what\u2019s yours is up for negotiation.\u201d",
      "Bondarev also said Putin sees negotiations only as a vehicle \u201cto deliver him whatever he wants,\" adding it's \u201castonishing\u201d that Western leaders still don't understand Kremlin tactics.",
      "That means Putin is likely to welcome any meeting with Trump, since it promotes Russia as a global force and plays well domestically, but he will offer little in return.",
      "Trump said Zelenskyy should have made a deal with Putin to avoid war, adding he wouldn\u2019t have allowed the conflict to start if he had been in office.",
      "Trump has threatened Russia with more tariffs, sanctions and oil price cuts, but there is no economic \u201cwonder weapon\u201d that can end the war, said Richard Connolly, a Russian military and economic expert at London's Royal United Services Institute.",
      "And the Kremlin is brushing off the threats, likely because the West already has heavily sanctioned Russia.",
      "Trump also can't guarantee Ukraine would never join NATO, nor can he lift all Western sanctions, easily force Europe to resume importing Russian energy or get the International Criminal Court to rescind its war crimes arrest warrant for Putin.",
      "Speaking to the Davos World Economic Forum, Trump said he wants the OPEC+ alliance and Saudi Arabia to cut oil prices to push Putin to end the war. The Kremlin said that won\u2019t work because the war is about Russian security, not the price of oil. It also would harm U.S. oil producers.",
      "\u201cIn the tradeoff between Putin and domestic oil producers, I\u2019m pretty sure which choice Trump will make,\u201d said Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin.",
      "Trump could pressure Russia by propping up the U.S. oil industry with subsidies and lift the 10% trade tariffs imposed on China in exchange for Beijing limiting economic ties with Moscow, which could leave it \u201ctruly isolated,\u201d Connolly said.",
      "Europe also could underscore its commitment to Kyiv \u2013 and curry favor with Trump \u2013 by buying U.S. military equipment to give to Ukraine, said Lord Peter Ricketts, a former U.K. national security adviser.",
      "Lukyanov suggested that Trump's allies often seem afraid of him and crumble under his threats.",
      "The \u201cbig question,\u201d he said, is what will happen when Putin won\u2019t."

      "Macron's team wants to shift the focus away from the race to develop better-than-human artificial intelligence through sheer computing power and, instead, open up access to data that can help AI solve problems like cancer or long COVID.",
      "\u201cWe now have this incredible opportunity to figure out not only how we should mitigate the potential harms from artificial intelligence, but also how we can ensure that it\u2019s used to improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Martin Tisn\u00e9, the summit\u2019s special envoy for public interest AI.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has spoken of his desire to make the U.S. the \u201cworld capital of artificial intelligence\u201d by tapping its oil and gas reserves to feed the energy-hungry technology. Meanwhile, he has moved to withdraw the U.S. \u2014 again \u2014 from the Paris climate agreement and revoked former President Joe Biden's executive order for AI guardrails.",
      "Trump is replacing it with his own AI policy designed to maintain America's global leadership by reducing regulatory barriers and building AI systems free of \u201cideological bias.\u201d",
      "The U.S. position might undermine any joint communique, said Nick Reiners, senior geotechnology analyst at the Eurasia Group.",
      "\u201cTrump is against the very idea of global governance,\u201d Reiners said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to get countries to agree that AI should have guardrails and that AI safety is something worth caring about. But they\u2019ve widened the scope to talk about the future of work and the environment and inclusivity and so on \u2014 a whole range of concepts. So it\u2019s hard to imagine getting a widespread agreement on such a broad range of subjects.\u201d",
      "Chinese leader Xi is sending Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, who's been elevated to the role of Xi's special representative.",
      "It's a big step up from the 2023 Bletchley meeting, when the Chinese government sent the vice minister of science and technology. It signifies that Xi wants China to play a bigger role in global AI governance as Trump pulls back, Reiners said.",
      "DeepSeek \u2019s release last month stunned the world because of its ability to rival Western players like ChatGPT. It also escalated the wider geopolitical showdown between Beijing and Washington over tech supremacy.",
      "Trump said DeepSeek was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the U.S. tech industry and his AI advisor David Sacks accused DeepSeek of training its model on stolen OpenAI data. The DeepSeek chatbot app now faces investigations, and in some cases, bans in the U.S. and a number of other countries over privacy and security concerns.",
      "Yet the rise of DeepSeek, which built its open source AI model at a fraction of the cost and with fewer chips, also puts China's interests in line with France's.",
      "Organizers want the summit to act as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for France and the wider European tech scene to catch up with AI advances, which have been led by the U.S. and China. Macron hopes to make room for others, including French startup Mistral, which also uses an open source AI model.",
      "\u201cDeepSeek is being seen as a kind of vindication of this idea that you don\u2019t have to necessarily invest hundreds of billions of dollars in in chips and data centers,\u201d Reiners said.",
      "Another showdown could involve Brussels, which has long been a thorn in the side of U.S.-based Big Tech companies, cracking down with antitrust penalties against the likes of Google, Apple and Meta. Trump lashed out at last month's World Economic Forum with \u201cvery big complaints\u201d about the EU\u2019s multibillion-dollar fines, calling them a tax on American companies.",
      "More recently, the EU\u2019s artificial intelligence regulation has met resistance from the companies. The European Union recently unveiled a non-binding \"code of practice\u201d for its AI Act but Meta's top lobbyist said the company, which owns Facebook and Instagram, won\u2019t sign up.",
      "The EU guidelines, intended to standardize how the AI Act's regulations are applied across the 27-nation bloc, are \u201cunworkable\u201d and the continent\u2019s regulatory environment is \u201cpushing Europe to the sidelines,\u201d Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan told a Brussels event.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump has followed through on his promise to punish South Africa by signing an executive order stopping all aid and assistance to the country over what he called a human rights violation against a white minority group",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump followed through on his promise to punish South Africa by signing an executive order Friday stopping all aid to the country over what he called a human rights violation against a white minority group.",
      "The Trump administration says a land expropriation law South Africa recently passed was \"blatantly\" discriminatory against its white Afrikaners, who are descendants of Dutch and other European colonials. The Trump administration said the South African government was allowing violent attacks against Afrikaner farming communities.",
      "It also accused South Africa of supporting \"bad actors\" in the world, including the militant Palestinian group Hamas, Russia and Iran.",
      "Land distribution in South Africa has been a complicated and highly emotive issue with racial connotations for more than 30 years since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.",
      "It was thrust into the global spotlight after Trump and his South African-born adviser Elon Musk criticized the South African government's policies as anti-white, sometimes with false statements.",
      "The new Expropriation Act gives the South African government scope to expropriate land from private parties, but only if it's in the public interest and under certain conditions. Trump referred to it last Sunday when he first announced his intention to stop funding to South Africa.",
      "He said South Africa's government was doing \u201cterrible things\u201d and claimed land was being confiscated from \u201ccertain classes.\u201d That's not true, and even groups in South Africa who are challenging the law say no land has been confiscated. The South African government says private property rights are protected and Trump's description of the law includes misinformation and \u201cdistortions.\u201d",
      "However, the law has prompted concern in South Africa, especially from groups representing parts of the white minority, who say it will target them and their land even though race is not mentioned in the law.",
      "The law is tied to the legacy of the racist apartheid system, and colonialism before that, and is part of South Africa's efforts over decades to try and find a way to right historic wrongs.",
      "Under apartheid, Black people had land taken away from them and were forced to live in designated areas for non-whites. Now, whites make up around 7% of South Africa's population of 62 million but own approximately 70% of the private farming land, and the government says that inequality needs to be addressed.",
      "Afrikaners are a group of white South Africans descended mainly from Dutch settlers who arrived around 370 years ago. They speak Afrikaans, one of South Africa's 11 official languages, and make up many of South Africa's rural farming communities.",
      "Afrikaners were at the heart of the apartheid regime, and tensions between some Afrikaner groups and Black political parties have lingered after apartheid, although South Africa has largely been successful in reconciling its many racial groups and most Afrikaners consider themselves part of the new South Africa.",
      "Some examples of Afrikaners who gained international prominence include EFC fighter Dricus du Plessis, golfers Ernie Els and Louis Oosthuizen, and actor Charlize Theron.",
      "Trump's executive order addresses serious human rights violations in South Africa, according to his administration, and says the South African government has allowed violent attacks on Afrikaner farmers and their families. Trump said the U.S. will establish a plan to resettle white South African farmers and their families as refugees.",
      "The Tesla billionaire and Trump ally was born and raised in South Africa but left after high school in the late 1980s, when South Africa was still under the apartheid regime.",
      "He has for years criticized the current leadership in his homeland, accusing them of anti-white policies and ignoring or even encouraging a \u201cgenocide\u201d with regards to the killings of some white farmers. Those killings are at the center of claims by conservative commentators \u2014 and now amplified by Trump and Musk \u2014 that South Africa is allowing attacks on white farmers as a means to remove them.",
      "The South African government has condemned the killings and says they are part of the country's desperately high violent crime rates across the board. Experts say there is no evidence of genocide and the killings make up a very small percentage of homicides. For example, a group that records farm attacks says 49 farmers or their families were killed in 2023, while there were more than 27,000 homicides in the country that year.",
      "Musk also accused South Africa this week of having \u201cracist ownership laws,\u201d an apparent reference to his failure to get a license in the country for his Starlink satellite internet service because it doesn't meet affirmative action criteria.",
      "Trump's order stops hundreds of millions of dollars a year the U.S. gives South Africa, most of it to help its HIV/AIDS response. The U.S. gave South Africa around $440 million last year and funds 17% of South Africa's HIV program through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.",
      "Parts of that funding had already been threatened by Trump's global aid freeze, but it will now all be stopped in a major blow to South Africa's health sector. South Africa has around 8 million people living with HIV \u2014 with 5.5 million of them receiving antiretroviral medication \u2014 and U.S. funding is vital in supporting the largest national HIV/AIDS program in the world.",
      "The executive order also said South Africa had taken an anti-American stance \u2014 even \u201cled the charge\u201d \u2014 on many issues, accusing it of supporting Hamas, Russia and Iran, and being too close to China's ruling Communist Party.",
      "South Africa has long been a supporter of Palestinians and a critic of Israel and has maintained close ties to Russia because of its help in fighting apartheid. Trump's order appears to require a significant shift in South Africa's foreign policy to allow the aid to start again.",

      "They were embraced by family members, some of whom cried, in the arrivals hall at Suvarnabhumi airport. Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sagniampongsa and the Israeli Ambassador to Thailand Orna Sagiv were both at the airport to welcome home the freed hostages.",

      "The group quickly left the news conference to return to their hometowns in Thailand's northern and northeastern regions.",
      "They were the second batch of Thai hostages released since the war broke out. During an earlier ceasefire in November 2023, 23 Thai nationals were released in a deal negotiated between Thailand and Hamas, with assistance from Qatar and Iran.",
      "All five men were assessed at a hospital outside Tel Aviv prior to their return. Four of them were joined by one relative each earlier this week. The trip was sponsored by the Israeli government, according to the Thai Embassy in Tel Aviv.",
      "Hamas militants kidnapped 31 Thai nationals during the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on southern Israel, making them the largest group of foreigners held captive. Many of the Thai agricultural workers lived in compounds on the outskirts of southern Israeli kibbutzim and towns, and Hamas militants overran those places first.",
      "A total of 46 Thais have been killed during the conflict, including two Thai citizens who were killed during the attack and their bodies taken into Gaza, according to Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "There was no immediate information available about Nattapong Pingsa, who is the last Thai hostage left in Gaza, nor the two Thai workers whose bodies were taken into Gaza.",
      "Maris, the Thai foreign minister, traveled to Israel to visit the five freed men shortly after their release. Maris met with his Israeli counterparts seeking support to secure the release of the remaining Thai hostage and retrieve the bodies of the two deceased Thais.",
      "Thai workers remain the largest group of foreign agricultural laborers in Israel. The countries implemented a bilateral agreement a decade ago specifically easing the way for Thai agricultural workers. Many Palestinian workers had since returned, and before the Hamas attack about half of Israel\u2019s workforce was made up of foreign and Palestinian laborers."

      "Ever since Winston Churchill coined the phrase, politicians have extolled the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the United States and Britain",
      "LONDON -- Ever since Winston Churchill coined the phrase in the wake of World War II, politicians have extolled the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the United States and Britain.",
      "Under President Donald Trump's second administration, Britain will settle for a merely functional relationship with its former colony turned most important ally. As Trump threatens to slap tariffs on America\u2019s neighbors, mulls buying Greenland and suggests the U.S. could \u201ctake over\u201d and reconstruct Gaza,Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s government is racing to bolster its diplomatic and economic defenses for a turbulent new transatlantic era.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in such uncharted waters that anyone who claims to know what in the hell is going on is just lying,\u201d said Kathleen Burk, emeritus professor at University College London and an expert on U.S.-U.K. relations.",
      "British officials say Starmer hopes to visit Washington in the coming weeks, but he has yet to receive an invitation from Trump.",
      "In the meantime, a heavy burden rests on Britain\u2019s new ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson. A towering figure in Starmer\u2019s Labour Party who served in the governments of former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Mandelson replaces veteran diplomat Karen Pierce, who was widely respected by both Democrats and Republicans in Washington.",
      "It\u2019s rare for a politician, rather than a career civil servant, to be given a key U.K. ambassadorial post. The center-left former lawmaker is not an obvious emissary to the Trump administration. Mandelson once called Trump a \u201cdanger to the world\u201d \u2014 words he now says were \u201cill-judged and wrong.\u201d",
      "But some analysts see Mandelson as a canny choice. A controversial figure who twice resigned from government over allegations of financial or ethical impropriety, he has \u2014 like Trump \u2014 repeatedly bounced back. His mastery of political intrigue brought him the nickname \u201cPrince of Darkness.\u201d",
      "Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, said Mandelson is \u201ca considerable political talent\u201d with economic expertise from his time as the EU\u2019s trade commissioner between 2004 and 2008.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s also very comfortable with very rich people,\u201d Rutter said. \u201cHe\u2019s very well connected. He will give very classy parties.\u201d",
      "In addition to diplomatic clout, Britain plans to deploy another key asset: the royal family. Trump, whose mother was born on Scotland\u2019s remote Isle of Lewis, owns two Scottish golf courses and is a fan of the royals. He praised the late Queen Elizabeth II, who hosted him at Buckingham Palace during a 2019 state visit, and said he had a \u201cgreat talk\u201d with Prince William when the two men met in December.",
      "A return visit to the U.K. for Trump, replete with pomp and pageantry, seems likely.",
      "Some politicians on the right of U.K. politics see Trump\u2019s return as an opportunity for deeper U.K.-U.S. trade ties, maybe even a long-elusive free trade agreement.",
      "Talks on a trade deal started after Britain left the European Union in 2020 but foundered on issues including agriculture, with strong opposition in Britain to importing chlorine-rinsed chicken or hormone-treated beef.",
      "A further complication is Starmer\u2019s desire for closer trade with the EU as part of a \u201creset\u201d with the bloc after years of acrimony over Brexit. Sandwiched between the U.S. and the EU, Britain could face pressure to pick a side.",
      "\u201cSurely the choice is obvious,\u201d Conservative Party lawmaker John Cooper said during a recent debate in Parliament. \u201cUnder President Trump, the American eagle is starting to spread its wings. \u2026 Europe is fading, with sclerotic growth amid political turmoil.\u201d",
      "But Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the U.S. and the Americas program at the international affairs think-tank Chatham House, said choosing between Europe and America was a \u201cridiculous proposition.\u201d While the U.S. is Britain\u2019s biggest individual trading partner, half of Britain\u2019s trade is with the 27 EU members.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t choose,\u201d Vinjamuri said. \u201cAt the end of the day, Europe, the U.S. and the U.K. are in this together, and so they have to find different ways of working\" together.",
      "Trump has already ratcheted up pressure on longstanding allies, announcing he would impose tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico, then postponing them after getting pledges from the two counties to beef up border security.",
      "Trump has suggested Britain could escape similar tariffs. \u201cI think that one can be worked out,\u201d he said.",
      "Britain is helped by the fact that, according to official U.S. statistics, the U.S. sells more goods to the UK. than it imports.",
      "Britain is also facing pressure from Trump to increase defense spending. Trump has long questioned the value of NATO and threatened not to defend members of the alliance that fail to meet defense-spending goals.",
      "The president has said NATO countries should spend at least 5% of their income on defense, up from the current 2% target. Britain spends 2.3% of GDP on defense and says it will increase that figure to 2.5%.",
      "\u201cThe one thing that the Americans will pay attention to is the defense budget, because Britain started losing leverage with the U. S. when its army and its navy started going down in the 1970s,\u201d Burk said.",
      "Britain is one of the biggest supporters of Ukraine in its war against Russia's invasion \u2014 a war Trump wants to end, on terms that remain unclear. Starmer and his officials hope to press the U.S. government not to abandon Ukraine or back a deal favorable to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "British diplomats and spies are also trying to assess what the new U.S. government means for vital intelligence-sharing. Britain and the U.S. share top-secret intelligence as members of the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d group with Canada, Australia and New Zealand.",
      "U.K. officials were somewhat relieved by the appointment of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, an experienced politician and a known quantity. They have little acquaintance with, and some concerns about, Trump\u2019s nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel, and his pick to oversee national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard has repeatedly echoed Russian propaganda used to justify the Kremlin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and in the past opposed a key U.S. surveillance program.",
      "It's impossible to prepare for everything the next four years could bring.",
      "Rutter said ministers and civil servants need to think about the unthinkable. For instance, what happens if deep cuts to regulation and the machinery of government mean parts of the U.S. start failing?",
      "\u201cWhen do you start having to give people warnings not to fly to the U.S. because we don\u2019t trust your aviation regulation anymore?\u201d she said.",
      "Vinjamuri said the coming years will test to the limit Britain\u2019s historic strength of quiet diplomacy, \u201cworking very pragmatically below the headline to try and get things done.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe challenge is, we have some known unknowns, (like) what will happen when it comes to America\u2019s support for Ukraine and for Europe\u2019s security,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have a lot of unknown unknowns, too. And that, I think, is going to be the much trickier part.\u201d"

      "Kurds in Syria were marginalized during five decades of Assad family rule, with many denied citizenship and wrongly described as Arabs",
      "QAMISHLI, Syria -- Kurds in Syria were marginalized during five decades of Assad family rule, with many denied citizenship and wrongly described as Arabs. Now they are seizing the chance during the post-Assad transition to keep the cultural gains they made in the northeast enclave they carved out during the country's civil war.",
      "Mothers can now give children Kurdish names. The Kurdish language is taught in schools. The new year, Nowruz, can be celebrated openly. The Kurds, one of the world\u2019s largest populations without a state of their own, have been feeling some control over their lives and want to make that permanent with a new government in power.",
      "But that depends on Syria\u2019s new leaders, and the outcome of an ongoing conflict between the Kurds and Turkish-backed rebels that\u2019s been overshadowed by the dramatic shift from Assad rule. Two months of fighting have left scores dead on both sides.",
      "\u201cWe have made all these gains. There is no way we will abandon them, even over our bodies and the bodies of our children,\u201d said Amira Ali, a Kurdish woman from the northeastern city of Hassakeh whose husband is a member of the local police force known as, \u201cAsayish,\" the Kurdish term for security.",
      "Shortly after the uprising against the Assad government began in 2011, the Kurds filled the vacuum created by the withdrawal of government forces from wide areas of Syria's northeast. The main Kurdish-led force now controls about 25% of Syria. An autonomous authority runs day-to-day affairs of the region that many Kurds call \u201cRojava Kurdistan,\u201d or \u201cwestern Kurdistan.\u201d",
      "Now Kurdish leaders are negotiating with the new authorities in Damascus on the future of their people, who made up 10% of the country\u2019s prewar population. They don\u2019t want full autonomy with their own government and parliament; they want decentralization, room to run their day-to day-affairs.",
      "The new authorities, however, are allied with the Turkish-backed armed groups that launched an offensive against the Kurds in December during the chaos around Assad\u2019s fall. The fighting between the Kurds and the coalition known as the Syrian National Army has forced about 100,000 people to flee their homes.",
      "The conflict has major implications for Syria\u2019s future as its new government, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham former Islamist rebel group, tries to consolidate control and begin rebuilding after nearly 14 years of civil war.",
      "Mazloum Abdi, commander of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, the main Kurdish-led force, said the country should be a secular, civil and decentralized state that treats all citizens equally. Western countries have called on Syria's new rulers to respect minorities and women's rights.",
      "Abdi recalled the Syrian identity cards that described all its citizens as \u201cSyrian Arab citizens,\u201d including non-Arabs like the Kurds. They want it to be changed to \u201cSyrian citizens.\u201d",
      "\u201cKurds were persecuted by previous authorities,\u201d he said. He wants anti-Kurd laws to be abolished.",
      "Abdi and others point out that the Kurds played an important role in defeating the Islamic State group as it rampaged across Syria and neighboring Iraq for years during Syria\u2019s civil war.",
      "The Kurdish-led SDF was formed to fight the extremists, and in 2019, SDF fighters captured the last sliver of land they held, the eastern Syrian village of Baghouz. The SDF and other members of the U.S.-led coalition continue the fight against IS sleeper cells.",
      "The SDF lost thousands of its members in fighting IS, as well as against the armed factions backed by Turkey. Ankara regards the SDF as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, a Kurdish separatist militant group it has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "Turkey has launched four incursions into northern Syria since 2016, capturing wide areas along its borders and displacing hundreds of thousands of people. It is not clear whether those incursions will stop after Assad's fall.",
      "The streets in northeast Syria are decorated with photographs of fallen Kurdish fighters.",
      "\u201cGod willing, the blood of these martyrs will not be wasted,\u201d said Amina Hussein, 57, as she lit incense on the grave of her son Dersim Sheikhi, killed in 2015 while fighting IS.",
      "\u201cKurds have achieved a lot, and we should preserve this,\u201d she said on a cold morning in the SDF\u2019s Martyrs Cemetery, where hundreds of men and women are buried.",
      "The offensive by the Turkish-backed armed groups is the latest challenge to Kurdish gains.",
      "The 70-year-old Goulieh Abdu has been displaced twice in the past two months by the fighting. Now she shelters in a compound once run by forces loyal to Assad after SNA shelling forced her to flee to the city of Qamishli.",
      "\u201cI swear to God that displacement has killed us,\u201d Abdu said, sitting on a mattress next to a diesel heater on a cold January morning. \u201cWhat did we do to be punished this way?\u201d",
      "Another woman, Elham Horo, fled Tel Rifaat with her children and grandchildren in the SNA offensive.",
      "\u201cAll what we have left is our souls. If they want to take it, then let them do it,\u201d Horo said as she sat with her grandchildren on the floor of a classroom in Qamishli now used as a shelter for the displaced.",
      "In Tel Rifaat, now seized by the SNA, its fighters blamed Kurdish gunmen for displacing Arabs from the town over the years. Arab residents said they could now return to their homes.",
      "\u201cThey left us nothing,\u201d said resident Muhammad Kabso, 42, who said he returned home to find that the Kurd who had been living there had burned his cherished olive and pomegranate trees.",
      "Both the SDF and the authorities in Damascus have been sending positive signals about their talks on the future of Syria's northeast and the Kurds. Authorities have said the Kurds were unjustly treated under Assad.",
      "\u201cWe will work together to build a country in which everyone feels equality and justice,\u201d Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani recently posted on X \u2014 in Kurdish.",

    "story": [
      "As Gillian Brisley and her husband, Pete, watched their son-in-law\u2019s release from captivity, she clutched a teddy bear to her chest",
      "LONDON -- As Gillian Brisley and her husband, Pete, watched their son-in-law\u2019s release from captivity on Saturday morning, she clutched a teddy bear to her chest.",
      "It was a reminder of everything the family has suffered since Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing their daughter, Lianne Sharabi, and teenage granddaughters, Noiya and Yahel, while taking son-in-law Eli Sharabi hostage. Eli\u2019s brother Yossi was also killed.",
      "The stuffed toy, which once belonged to Lianne, was a tangible link between the Brisleys and events in the Middle East as they watched the hostage handover unfold on TV at their home in South Wales.",
      "\u201cWhile Gill was crying, she was holding on to the teddy bear, which was Lianne\u2019s from the age of about 10 years old and which we were lucky enough to find on Kibbutz Be\u2019eri when we went to the house,\u201d Pete Brisley said. \u201cWhen we went to the house, it was filthy, bullet holes everywhere. So we tidied up the house, tidied up the garden, so if Eli wanted to come home to it then it looks reasonable because it was an absolute shambles.\u201d",
      "Even that simple cleanup was an act of faith because the family had received no word on Sharabi at all since the militants took him back to Gaza with more than 200 other hostages.",
      "Out of nowhere, the Brisleys were told Friday that Sharabi, 52, was to be one of three hostages released the next day. So they got up early Saturday morning to see their son-in-law walk free.",
      "The moment was bittersweet. They were thrilled that he was finally free but horrified by the pale, emaciated figure they saw on TV. This wasn\u2019t the swarthy, robust man they last saw 18 months ago. The spark that always glinted in his eyes was gone.",
      "\u201cHe looks as though he\u2019s been to Belsen,\u2019\u2019 Pete Brisley said, referring to the World War II concentration camp.",
      "Sharabi\u2019s release also triggered other emotions for family members, who had suppressed their grief by focusing their energies on securing his freedom.",
      "When asked how she felt, Gillian Brisley said she was relieved he was free. But there was more to say.",
      "\u201cThe emotion of seeing him also then brought the grief of losing our girls right up to our throats,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just sat here and we cried. We cried for our loss. We cried with relief that Eli was on his way home. We cried for Yossi. Just, you know, mixed emotions.\u201d",
      "Then there\u2019s the continuing concern for Sharabi.",
      "The family doesn\u2019t know whether Sharabi was told about what happened to his wife and daughters before he was released. They hope he was, so that he doesn\u2019t have to process that grief after surviving 490 days in captivity, said Stephen Brisley, Lianne's brother.",
      "Lianne met Eli Sharabi on a three-month work experience assignment at Kibbutz Be\u2019eri, married and then made her home in Israel.",
      "Naturally, the bear came along. Growing up in Wales, the bear was part of the family.",
      "When they were being naughty, her brothers would hide the bear from her, or stick it in a drawer with only its toes dangling out, Stephen Brisley remembered. It also participated in tea parties on the bedroom floor and sat in the audience as the kids pretended to hold rock concerts with tennis rackets for guitars and broomsticks for microphones.",
      "For a family that isn\u2019t religious and doesn\u2019t find strength in prayer, the bear now provides a link to lost loved ones.",
      "\u201cMum has found it a great comfort to speak to Leanne\u2019s bear, and she says basically she speaks to the bear every morning, every evening and she speaks to the bear as though she\u2019s talking to Leanne,\u201d Stephen Brisley said.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s been a cathartic experience for her. \u2026 It\u2019s a tangible sort of physical connection to somebody that you can\u2019t have that real hug with.\u2019\u2019",

      "GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador -- GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (AP) \u2014 Ecuador\u2019s presidential election Sunday is shaping up to be a repeat of the 2023 race, when voters chose a conservative young millionaire over the leftist prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the country\u2019s most influential president this century.",
      "President Daniel Noboa and Luis Gonz\u00e1lez are the clear front-runners among the pool of 16 candidates. All promised voters to reduce the widespread crime that pushed their lives into an unnerving new normal four years ago.",
      "The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. So many voters have become crime victims that their personal and collective losses will be a determining factor in deciding whether a third president in four years can turn Ecuador around or if Noboa deserves more time in office.",

      "Noboa, 37, is an heir to a fortune built on the banana trade. His political career began in 2021, when he won a seat in the National Assembly and chaired its Economic Development Commission. He opened an event organizing company when he was 18 and then joined his father\u2019s Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas.",

      "Gonz\u00e1lez, 47, held various government jobs during the presidency of Correa, who led Ecuador from 2007 through 2017 with free-spending socially conservative policies and grew increasingly authoritarian in his last years as president. He was sentenced to prison in absentia in 2020 in a corruption scandal.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez was a lawmaker from 2021 until May 2023, when Lasso dissolved the National Assembly. She was unknown to most voters until Correa\u2019s party picked her as its presidential candidate for the snap election."

      "Israel views the security prisoners as terrorists, while Palestinians see them as freedom fighters resisting a decades-long military occupation.",
      "Nearly every Palestinian has a friend or family member who has been jailed by Israel at some point, for militant attacks or lesser offenses like rock-throwing, protesting or membership in a banned political group. Some are held for months or years without trial in what is known as administrative detention, which Israel says is needed to prevent attacks and avoid sharing sensitive intelligence.",
      "Eighteen of those released Saturday had been sentenced to life and 54 were serving long sentences for their involvement in deadly attacks against Israelis. Seven of those convicted of the most serious crimes will be transferred to Egypt ahead of further deportation.",
      "Among those being released are 111 Palestinians who were rounded up after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, which triggered the war. They have been detained without trial.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some prominent Palestinian prisoners released since the truce went into effect on Jan. 19.",
      "Abu Shakhdam, 49, was sentenced to the equivalent of 18 life sentences over his involvement in Hamas attacks that killed dozens of Israelis during the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, between 2000 and 2005.",
      "Among the most infamous of those attacks was a double suicide bombing that blew up two buses in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba in 2004, killing 16 Israelis, including a 4-year-old, and wounding over 100 others. In interviews with Arabic media, he described his militancy as a desire for revenge stemming from his brother\u2019s killing by Israeli security forces in 2000.",
      "Abu Shakhdam was on the run for weeks before his arrest in his hometown of Hebron in the West Bank in November 2004, following a gunfight with Israeli security forces in which he was shot 10 times.",
      "During 21 years in prison, his family said, he finished high school and earned a certificate for courses in psychology.",
      "Al-Tawil, 61, a prominent Hamas politician in the occupied West Bank, has spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli prison, in part over allegations that he helped plot suicide bombings.",
      "Most recently, the Israeli military arrested al-Tawil 2021, saying that he had participated in violent riots and mobilized Hamas political activists in Ramallah, the seat of the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority and Hamas' main rival.",
      "He had been held without charge or trial since then. After his arrest, he went on hunger strike for more than three weeks to protest his administrative detention.",
      "During one of al-Tawil's stints in Israeli prison in the early 2000s, he ran a successful electoral campaign from custody to become mayor of Al-Bireh, a West Bank town abutting Ramallah.",
      "U.S. court documents from 2007, filed by the families of Israelis killed during the second intifada, show that al-Tawil had served for years as chairman of Al-Islah Charitable Society, a front organization to raise money for Hamas. The case accused al-Tawil of recruiting a Hamas militant to carry out a 2001 suicide bombing that targeted a crowded pedestrian mall in Jerusalem, killing 11 people.",
      "His daughter, 32-year-old journalist Bushra al-Tawil, was among the dozens of women and teenagers released in the first round of prisoner-for-hostage exchanges on Jan. 19.",
      "He and another prisoner were immediately taken to a hospital for medical treatment after their release on Saturday.",
      "The Palestinian manager of the Gaza branch of World Vision, a major Christian aid organization, was arrested in 2016 and accused of diverting tens of millions of dollars to Hamas in a high-profile case that drew criticism from rights groups. He was freed on Feb. 1.",
      "Both el-Halabi, 47, and World Vision vigorously denied the allegations and independent investigations found no proof of wrongdoing. One independent audit found that el-Halabi had enforced internal controls and ordered employees to avoid anyone suspected of Hamas ties.",
      "Rights groups say el-Halabi was denied a fair and transparent trial, as he and World Vision had no chance to review the evidence against them. U.N. experts say el-Halabi was questioned for 50 days without access to a lawyer. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.",
      "Israel has attributed the closed hearings to sensitive security information being relayed.",
      "Amouri, 44, from the northern West Bank city of Jenin, was arrested for his alleged role in manufacturing the powerful car bomb that detonated beside an Israeli bus packed with passengers on June 5, 2002, killing 17 Israelis in what became known as the Megiddo Junction suicide bombing.",
      "The attack during the second intifada took place in northern Israel. The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility.",
      "Amouri was sentenced to life in prison, plus 20 years. He was among those transferred to Egypt on Feb. 1 and released into exile.",
      "Zakaria Zubeidi is a prominent former militant leader and theater director whose dramatic jailbreak in 2021 thrilled Palestinians across the Middle East and stunned the Israeli security establishment.",
      "Zubeidi was a senior militant in the Al-Aqsa Martyrs\u2019 Brigade in the urban Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. After the second intifada in 2006, he co-founded a theater in Jenin to promote what he described as cultural resistance to Israel. The Freedom Theater has put on everything from Shakespeare to stand-up comedy to plays written by residents.",
      "In 2019, after Zubeidi had already served years in prison for attacks in the early 2000s, Israel arrested him again over his alleged involvement in shooting attacks that targeted buses of Israeli settlers but caused no injuries.",
      "Zubeidi, who was released on Jan. 30 into the West Bank, had been awaiting trial in prison. He denies the charges, saying that he gave up militancy to focus on his political activism after the intifada.",
      "In 2021, he and five other prisoners tunneled out of a maximum-security prison in northern Israel. All six were recaptured days later.",
      "A Hamas militant during the second intifada, Abu Warda helped organize a series of suicide bombings that killed over 40 people and wounded more than a hundred others. Israel arrested him in 2002, and sentenced him to 48 terms of lifetime imprisonment, among the longest sentences it ever issued.",
      "As a young student, Abu Warda joined Hamas at the start of the intifada following Israel\u2019s killing of Yahya Ayyash, the militant group\u2019s leading bomb maker, in 1996.",
      "Palestinian authorities said at the time that Abu Warda had helped to recruit suicide bombers, whose attacks targeting crowded civilian areas in Israeli cities killed scores of people in the early 2000s.",
      "Abu Warda was released and deported on Jan. 30.",
      "An activist in Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Aradeh was sentenced to life in prison for a range of offenses going back to the second intifada. Some of the charges, according to the Israeli Prison Service, included planting an explosive device and attempted murder.",
      "He was credited with plotting the extraordinary prison escape in 2021, when he and five other detainees, including Zubeidi, used spoons to tunnel out one of Israel\u2019s most secure prisons. They remained at large for days before being caught.",
      "From an impoverished and politically active family in Jenin, in the northern occupied West Bank, Aradeh has three brothers and a sister who have all spent years in Israeli prisons.",
      "He was welcomed as a sort of cult hero in Ramallah on Jan. 25 as family, friends and fans swarmed him, some chanting \u201cThe freedom tunnel!\u201d in reference to his jailbreak.",
      "All three men hail from the neighborhood of Silwan, in east Jerusalem, and rose within the ranks of Hamas. Held responsible for a string of deadly attacks during the second intifada, the men were handed multiple life sentences in 2002.",
      "They were accused of plotting a suicide bombing at a crowded pool hall near Tel Aviv in 2002 that killed 15 people. Later that year, they were found to have orchestrated a bombing at Hebrew University that killed nine people, including five American students. Israel had described Odeh, who was working as a painter at the university at the time, as the architect of the attack.",
      "All three were transferred to Egypt on Jan. 25. Their families live in Jerusalem and said they will join them in exile.",
      "The 67-year-old al-Tous had held the title of longest continuous Israeli imprisonment until his release last Saturday, Palestinian authorities said.",
      "First arrested in 1985 while fighting Israeli forces along the Jordanian border, the activist in the Fatah party spent a total of 39 years behind bars. Originally from the West Bank city of Bethlehem, he was among the prisoners exiled on Jan. 25.",

      "Some older people in Zimbabwe are taking up exercise wherever they can find the space as non-communicable diseases such as diabetes become a growing problem across Africa",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- At dawn, 65-year-old Nelly Mutandwa swapped her pajamas for leggings, a T-shirt and sneakers. She grabbed a bottle of water before heading to an unconventional workout spot: a cemetery in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "Surrounded by rows of graves, she joined other members of the Commandos Fitness Club in an hour-long session of squats, lunges and stretches as upbeat music blared. For Mutandwa, the daily routine is more than exercise. It\u2019s her lifeline in managing diabetes.",
      "\u201cThey are resting,\u201d she said, pointing to the graves. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to join them yet. That means I have to do the hard work here.\u201d",
      "With limited fitness facilities such as gyms in their neighborhoods, older Zimbabweans are exercising wherever they can to combat Africa\u2019s growing problem of non-communicable diseases like heart problems, high blood pressure and diabetes. Other groups exercise along highways or disused railway lines.",
      "Globally, non-communicable diseases, which are conditions that cannot be directly passed from person to person, are the leading cause of death, responsible for 41 million, or 74%, of annual fatalities, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "Non-communicable diseases currently account for about 40% of deaths annually in Zimbabwe, according to its ministry of health and child care.",
      "In Zimbabwe and the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, non-communicable diseases are set to overtake communicable diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and cholera as the leading cause of death or illness by 2030, according to WHO.",
      "Previously associated with older people, non-communicable diseases are increasingly spreading to children and young adults due to smoking, frequent alcohol use, unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity.",
      "This has sparked huge concern among experts and governments on a continent that is experiencing the world\u2019s fastest population growth and is home to its youngest population.",
      "Dr. Johannes Marisa, a public health specialist in Harare and president of the Medical and Dental Private Practitioners of Zimbabwe Association, said doctors are witnessing \u201ca rapid change\u201d as more children and young people are diagnosed with NCDs.",
      "He attributed it partly to sedentary lifestyles as many people spend much of their time glued to their smartphone screens at the expense of physical movement, as well as growing substance abuse and unhealthy diets.",
      "While climate change-induced droughts have left many rural people in Zimbabwe scrounging for food, traders in urban areas are racing to get a piece of the fast food market that\u2019s widely blamed for obesity.",
      "In Harare and other urban areas, franchises such as KFC compete with a mushrooming number of cheaper local restaurants and informal roadside stalls, public markets and even homes where one can grab a fried piece of chicken, a burger or a fries-and-sausage combo for a dollar.",
      "In response, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube in the 2025 national budget imposed a \u201cmodest\u201d 0.5% tax on sales of doughnuts and other foods including tacos, pizza, hot dogs, shawarma, fries, chicken and burgers by retailers to encourage \u201chealthier dietary choices\u201d and mitigate the prevalence of non-communicable diseases.",
      "Meanwhile, some older Zimbabweans are taking up physical exercise.",
      "For Mutandwa and her Commandos Fitness Club crew, the surroundings of the cemetery suffice. Coached by Joseph Nekati, whose mother\u2019s stroke in 2023 inspired him to help others, the free club has become a sanctuary for older fitness buffs. Eight of the club\u2019s roughly 20 members are older people, Nekati said.",
      "\u201cI weighed 86 kilograms (189 pounds) and struggled to stand up. I would struggle to breathe just walking in my house. Now, I\u2019m down to 76 kilograms (167 pounds) and I can walk long distances,\u201d said Susan Gomo, a 64-year-old grandmother managing high blood pressure and arthritis.",
      "The group exercise is also meant to encourage other older people to work out. \u201cSome of my age mates are reluctant,\u201d Gomo said. \u201cThey end up just eating and sitting at home. They might change their minds when they see me in great shape.\u201d",
      "Mutandwa said she picked up the habit of power walks when she visited her daughter in the United Kingdom in 2022. She decided to try it back home in Zimbabwe, but the roads in her township were potholed and crowded. She went for solo walks on a nearby hill, but she felt unsafe.",
      "Last year, she noticed the fitness club in the cemetery, where a wide and well-maintained path provides a convenient workout spot. With three of her neighbors, she approached the coach, who happily took them in.",
      "Now the cemetery has come to symbolize Mutandwa and others\u2019 quest to live healthier and outpace death \u2014 one step at a time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s serene, it\u2019s safe and we have a lot of space with minimal disturbances. Hopefully the (local) council can build proper facilities for us,\u201d she said, preparing to stroll back home.",

      "Kosovars started casting their votes in a parliamentary election considered a key test for Prime Minister Albin Kurti whose governing party achieved a landslide win four years ago",
      "PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Kosovars started casting their votes Sunday in a parliamentary election considered a key test for Prime Minister Albin Kurti whose governing party achieved a landslide win four years ago.",
      "This is the first time since independence in 2008 that Kosovo\u2019s parliament has completed a full four-year mandate. It is the ninth parliamentary vote in Kosovo since the end of the 1998-1999 war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists that pushed Serbian forces out following a 78-day NATO air campaign. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo\u2019s independence, proclaimed in 2008.",
      "The vote will determine who will lead the Kosovo side in negotiations on normalizing ties with Serbia, which stalled again last year. Those talks brokered by the U.S. and the European Union did not figure high on any party\u2019s agenda.",
      "Some 2 million eligible voters are to cast their ballots in 941 polling stations. They will elect 120 lawmakers from nearly 600 candidates from 27 political groupings. One independent candidate is also running.",
      "The Kosovar parliament has 20 seats reserved for minorities regardless of election results; 10 of which are for the Serb minority.",
      "Voting started at 0600 GMT, according to Kreshnik Radoniqi, head of the Central Election Commission. It is set to end at 1800 GMT.",
      "Kosovars abroad started voting on Saturday at 43 diplomatic missions around the world where some 20,000 voters from the nearly 100,000 of the diaspora, have physically cast their ballots. Others sent their votes by post.",
      "Kurti\u2019s left-wing Vetevendosje! or Self-Determination Movement Party is seen as the front-runner but is not expected to win the necessary majority to govern alone, leaving open the possibility the other two contenders join ranks if he fails to form a Cabinet.",
      "The other contenders are the Democratic Party of Kosovo, or PDK, whose main leaders are at The Hague tribunal accused of war crimes, and the Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, the oldest party in the country that lost much of its support after the death in 2006 of its leader, Ibrahim Rugova.",
      "The parties made big-ticket pledges to increase public salaries and pensions, improve education and health services, and fight poverty. However, they did not explain where the money would come from, nor how they would attract more foreign investment.",
      "Kosovo, with a population of 1.6 million, is one of the poorest countries in Europe with an annual gross domestic product of less than 6,000 Euros per person.",
      "Kurti has been at odds with Western powers over some Cabinet actions last year, such as a ban on using the Serbian dinar and transfers from Serbia to Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority members who depend on Belgrade's social services and payments. Washington, Brussels and the NATO-led stabilization force KFOR have urged the government in Pristina to refrain from unilateral actions, fearing the revival of inter-ethnic conflict.",
      "The EU suspended funding for some projects almost two years ago. Brussels has set conditions for the gradual lifting of the temporary measure, linked to Kosovo taking steps to de-escalate tensions in the north, where most of the Serb minority lives.",
      "Kosovo is also suffering after Washington imposed a 90-day freeze on funding for different projects through the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has been key in promoting the country\u2019s growth.",
      "KFOR has increased its presence in Kosovo after last year\u2019s tensions and added more for the parliamentary election period.",
      "A team of 100 observers from the European Union, 18 from the Council of Europe and about 1,600 others from international or local organizations will monitor the vote."

      "MEXICO CITY -- A magnitude-7.6 earthquake shook the Caribbean Sea southwest of the Cayman Islands Saturday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and some islands and countries urged people near the coastline to move inland in case of a tsunami.",
      "The quake struck at 6:23 p.m. local time in the middle of the sea and had a depth of 10 kilometers, the USGS said. Its epicenter was located 130 miles (209 kilometers) south-southwest of George Town in the Cayman Islands.",
      "The U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said there is no tsunami alert for the U.S. mainland but issued a tsunami advisory for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which was later cancelled.",
      "The sounding of alarms in Puerto Rico's northwest region caused people to leave coastal areas and caused heavy traffic, according to local media.",
      "Hazard Management Cayman Islands urged residents near the coast to move inland and to higher ground. It said wave heights of 0.3 to 1 meter are expected.",

      "Hamas-led militants are set to free three more hostages, all Israeli civilian men, and Israel will release dozens of Palestinian prisoners as part of a fragile agreement that has paused the war in the Gaza Strip",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Hamas-led militants are set to free three more hostages, all Israeli civilian men, on Saturday, and Israel will release dozens of Palestinian prisoners as part of a fragile agreement that has paused the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "President Donald Trump's stunning proposal to transfer the Palestinian population out of Gaza, welcomed by Israel but vehemently rejected by the Palestinians and most of the international community, does not appear to have affected the current phase of the truce, which runs until early March.",
      "But it could complicate talks over the second and more difficult phase, when Hamas is to release dozens more hostages in return for a lasting ceasefire. Hamas may be reluctant to free more captives \u2014 and lose its main bargaining chip \u2014 if it believes the U.S. and Israel are serious about depopulating the territory, which rights groups say would violate international law.",
      "The hostages to be released on Saturday, according to Hamas and Israel, are: Eli Sharabi, 52; Ohad Ben Ami, 56; and Or Levy, 34. All were abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war.",
      "It will be the fifth swap of hostages for prisoners since the ceasefire began on Jan. 19. Eighteen hostages and more than 550 Palestinian prisoners have already been freed in that time.",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire calls for the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 prisoners, the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza and an increase in humanitarian aid to the devastated territory. Last week, wounded Palestinians were allowed to leave Gaza for Egypt for the first time since May.",
      "Sharabi and Ben Ami were both taken hostage from Kibbutz Beeri, one of the hardest-hit farming communities in the Hamas attack. Levy was abducted from the Nova music festival, where he was taking shelter in a saferoom when the militants arrived.",
      "The 183 Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel on Saturday include 18 people serving life sentences for committing deadly attacks, 54 serving long-term sentences and 111 Palestinians from Gaza who were detained after the Oct. 7 attack. All are men, ranging in age from 20 to 61.",
      "While Israel considers them to be terrorists, Palestinians view them as heroes battling Israeli occupation. Virtually every Palestinian has a friend, relative or acquaintance who has been imprisoned.",
      "More than 100 hostages were released during a weeklong ceasefire in Nov. 2023. More than 70 are still in Gaza, and at least a third of them are believed to have been killed in the initial attack or to have died in captivity. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the 33 to be released in the first phase of the ceasefire are dead.",
      "It is not clear whether Israel and Hamas have begun negotiating a second phase of the ceasefire, which calls for releasing the remaining hostages and extending the truce indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached.",
      "Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the latest ceasefire. A key far-right partner in Netanyahu\u2019s coalition is calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire\u2019s first phase.",
      "Hamas says it won\u2019t release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "In the Oct. 7 attack that started the war, some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\u2019s retaliatory air and ground war, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "The Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in residential neighborhoods.",
      "Of the 72 security prisoners being released Saturday, five hail from east Jerusalem, 14 from the Gaza Strip and the remaining 53 from the occupied West Bank. Seven are set to be transferred to Egypt ahead of further deportation.",
      "A total of 47 prisoners will be set free Saturday from Ofer prison, in the West Bank, and transferred to Palestinian custody at the Betunia crossing point near the administrative center of Ramallah where scores of relatives, friends and supporters were preparing a hero\u2019s welcome for the returnees.",
      "The Palestinian security prisoners were detained over offenses ranging from bomb attacks to involvement in militant organizations, in some cases dating back decades.",
      "Among them is Iyad Abu Shakhdam, 49, who has been locked up for nearly 21 years over his involvement in Hamas militant attacks in crowded civilian areas that killed dozens of Israelis during the Palestinian uprising of the early 2000s. That included a notorious 2004 suicide bus bombing in Israel\u2019s southern desert city of Beersheba that killed 16 people, including a 4-year-old child.",
      "Another is Jamal al-Tawil, a prominent Hamas politician in the occupied West Bank and former mayor of the village of al-Bireh, abutting Ramallah.",
      "He has spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli jail, with the military reporting his last arrest in 2021 over his alleged participation in violent riots and efforts to entrench Hamas' leadership in the West Bank. He was transferred to administrative detention, a repeatedly renewable six-month period in which suspects are held without charge or trial.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state.",

      "Recent aviation disasters and close calls definitely have people worried about the safety of flying",
      "The spate of recent aviation disasters and close calls have people worried about the safety of flying.",
      "The midair collision that killed 67 near Washington, the fiery plane crash in Philadelphia and now a missing plane in Alaska are only the most high-profile disasters. There was also a Japan Airlines plane that clipped a parked Delta plane while it was taxiing at the Seattle airport earlier this week and a United Airlines plane caught fire during takeoff at the Houston airport Sunday after an engine problem sparked a fire on the wing.",
      "That's not even to mention the security concerns that arose after stowaways were found dead inside the wheel wells of two planes and aboard two other flights. And don't forget about the time that a passenger opened an emergency exit door on a plane while it was taxiing for takeoff in Boston.",
      "So of course people are wondering whether their flight is safe?",
      "The Jan. 29 collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter killed everyone aboard both aircraft. It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground. There hadn't even been a deadly crash of any kind involving a U.S. airliner since February 2009.",
      "Crashes are more common involving smaller planes like the single-engine Cessna that crashed in Alaska on Thursday. Ten people including the pilot were killed.",
      "A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people onboard and another person on the ground. That Learjet generated a massive fireball when it smashed into the ground in a neighborhood not long after taking off from a small airport nearby.",
      "Fatal crashes attract extraordinary attention partly because they are rare. The track record of U.S. airlines is remarkably safe, as demonstrated by the long stretch between fatal crashes.",
      "But deadly crashes have happened more recently elsewhere around the world, including one in South Korea that killed all 179 people aboard in December. There were also two fatal crashes involving Boeing\u2019s troubled 737 Max jetliner in 2018 and 2019. And last January, a door plug blew off a 737 Max while it was in flight, raising more questions about the plane.",
      "And federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.",
      "President Donald Trump added to those concerns Thursday when he blamed the midair collision on the \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system that airports rely on and promised to replace it.",
      "But even with all that, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy went on Fox News earlier this week and tried to assure viewers that air travel is \"way safer than traveling in a car and train. This is the safest mode of transportation.\u201d",
      "And the statistics back that up.",
      "The National Safety Council estimates that Americans have a 1-in-93 chance of dying in a motor vehicle crash, while deaths on airplanes are too rare to calculate the odds. Figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation tell a similar story.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration are investigating these recent crashes and close calls to determine what caused them and look for ways to prevent similar incidents.",
      "There have already been troubling revelations about the midair collision, but it will take more than a year to get the full report on what happened.",
      "The NTSB always recommends steps that could be taken to prevent crashes from happening again, but the agency has a long list of hundreds of previous recommendations that have been ignored by other government agencies and the industries it investigates.",
      "But Duffy said the public is right to say that crashes like the recent ones are unacceptable. That is why he plans to make sure \u201csafety is paramount\u201d as he leads the agency that regulates all modes of transportation.",
      "\u201cI feel really good about where we\u2019re at and where we\u2019re going and the plans we have in place to make sure we even make the system safer and more efficient than it is today,\u201d Duffy said in the Fox interview."

      "The three Baltic countries, which together share a 1,633-kilometer (1,015-mile) -long border with Russia and Belarus, officially informed Moscow and Minsk of the disconnection plan in July. Their national transmission system operators credited 1.2 billion euros ($1.25 billion) in EU and other support to help the countries synchronize with the Continental Europe Synchronous Area.",
      "\u201cLithuania has done a lot in the last 30 years to disconnect, to become independent,\u201d Naus\u0117da said. Three years ago, \u201cwe stopped buying any kind of energy resources from Russia. It was our response to the war in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Despite the advance notice, the Baltic nations are still on watch for a possible response from their former Soviet partners.",
      "\u201cThe risk of cyberattacks remains substantial,\u201d Litgrid said last week, adding that continued vigilance, collaboration, defensive steps and \u201crobust\u201d cybersecurity measures were needed to effectively mitigate potential threats.",
      "Latvian Prime Minister Evika Sili\u0146a warned Wednesday of possible provocations, but said Latvia was well-prepared and services including the armed forces and national guard were stepping up their vigilance and security measures.",
      "\u201cClearly there are risks, we understand that very well. But the risks are identified and there is a contingency plan in case these risks materialize,\u201d Sili\u0146a said.",
      "After the disconnection plans were announced, propaganda campaigns cropped up on social media and in printed leaflets in city streets that issued fake-news warnings about blackouts, severe energy shortages and sky-high energy bills for consumers.",
      "\u201cWe heard those rumors, but we are used to such things already\u201d said Jolanta Karavaitien\u0117, a retired teacher, in central Vilnius. \u201dOf course we must disconnect from them. Given the geopolitical situation, I see no reason for us to be there (in the Russian grid).\u201d",
      "Still, some in the region were taking precautionary measures.",
      "Estonia's public broadcaster ERR has reported surging sales of generators. Home appliance chain Bauhof sold dozens more generators last month compared to January a year ago, and rival Ehituse ABC had to limit their purchases the report said.",
      "The Baltic countries\u2019 steps toward energy independence have been decades in the making.",
      "In 2003, prior to joining the EU, Lithuania decided to shut down the Soviet-built Ignalina nuclear power plant in response to concerns in Brussels over its safety. It was decommissioned in 2009.",
      "Lithuania built an offshore oil terminal in the Baltic Sea in 1999. Seven years later, it became the country\u2019s sole crude oil import point after Russia\u2019s surprise move to halt supplies of oil to Lithuania through Russia\u2019s vast Druzhba pipeline network.",
      "Rokas Masiulis, the CEO of Litgrid, said Lithuania has \u201csuffered a great deal\u201d because of Russian actions in the past, such as through halting oil supplies and jacking up prices for gas that his country once depended on.",
      "He said Lithuania today has \u201cmuch more than we need\u201d in terms of electricity capacity, from both fossil fuels but also increasingly solar and wind. \u201cSo we are safe,\u201d he said.",
      "The disconnection with Russia \u201cis neither bad for them, (nor) bad for us,\u201d Masiulis said. \u201cWe were sort of interconnected and interdependent on each other. Now we will just part our ways.\u201d",
      "The three Baltic countries have rebuilt power lines and launched a vast construction and reconstruction program to turn their networks away from Russia and toward the West, the Litgrid CEO added, calling it a technological feat.",
      "\u201cActions by Russia -- by them being aggressive and pushing their neighbors -- has really helped us,\u201d Masiulis said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ve suffered a little with oil prices, with gas prices, but we were forced to act. So we built alternative routes.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow we\u2019re in much better state than we were before,\u201d he added. \u201cSo maybe they wished us ill, but ultimately everything worked very well for us.\u201d",

      "The move to disband Task Force KleptoCapture is one of several moves undertaken by the Justice Department under the new leadership of Attorney General Pam Bondi that presage a different approach toward Russia and national security issues.",
      "The department also ended the Foreign Influence Task Force, which was established in the first Trump administration to police influence campaigns staged by Russia and other nations aimed at sowing discord, undermining democracy and spreading disinformation. The U.S. government in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election aggressively moved to disrupt propaganda campaigns by Russia, which officials have assessed had a preference for Trump.",
      "In a memo addressed to all employees Wednesday \u2014 the first day of Bondi's tenure \u2014 the attorney general's office stated that \u201cattorneys assigned to those initiatives shall return to their prior posts, and resources currently devoted to those efforts shall be committed to the total elimination of Cartels and TCOs\u201d \u2014 an acronym for Transnational Criminal Organizations.",

      "The Justice Department on Wednesday also shifted its approach to enforcement of a World War II-era law known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires people to disclose to the government when they lobby in the U.S. on behalf of foreign governments -- including Russia -- or political entities. Under the policy change, prosecutors were directed to focus criminal enforcement on acts of more traditional espionage rather than registration violations.",
      "Despite the disbanding of the task force, Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have called for a more aggressive stance on Russia.

      "All the big swings on Wall Street show again how little investors control",
      "NEW YORK -- All of Wall Street's big recent swings show again how little investors control. When it comes to tariffs, inflation or how much profit Big Tech companies make, investors have very little sway.",
      "That's why it pays to exert control where possible, and for investors, that means keeping expenses in check. When the S&P 500 loses 2% anyway, why lose more by owning a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that tries to mimic it and then tacks on higher fees to do so?",
      "Fortunately for investors, finding lower-fee funds has become easier every year as the industry feels pressure to compete for investors. Across all U.S. stock mutual funds, investors are paying about 42 cents in fees for every $100 invested, according to the latest 2023 data from Investment Company Institute. That's down by more than half from 99 cents in 2000.",
      "And the momentum is continuing. Earlier this week, fund giant Vanguard said it was reducing expenses across 168 classes of mutual funds and ETFs, calling it the largest fee cut in the company's nearly 50-year history. The investment firm said the reductions will save its fund investors more than $350 million this year alone.",
      "\"Lower costs enable investors to keep more of their returns, and those savings compound over time,\u201d said Salim Ramji, Vanguard\u2019s chief executive officer.",
      "Most funds advertise their fees as something called an expense ratio. It shows what percentage of a fund's total dollars go toward covering its annual expenses. A lower number is generally better. Most expense ratios will be below 1%, and some funds even boast of zero expense ratios.",
      "Vanguard's cuts from earlier this week took the expense ratio of its Total International Stock fund ETF down to 0.05% from 0.08%, for example."

      "The Hawaii Supreme Court is scheduled to hear about insurance issues tying up a potential $4 billion Maui wild fire settlement",
      "HONOLULU -- Hawaii's Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Thursday over insurance issues that are tying up a potential $4 billion settlement over Maui's catastrophic 2023 wildfire, the deadliest in the U.S. in more than a century.",
      "The massive inferno decimated the historic town of Lahaina, killing more than 100 people, destroying thousands of properties and causing an estimated $5.5 billion in damage. Soon afterward, attorneys began lodging hundreds of lawsuits.",
      "A settlement was announced last summer, but insurance companies held out, insisting that they should have the right to go after the defendants separately to recoup money paid out to policyholders.",
      "Here are things to know about the settlement and the issues that could thwart the deal:",
      "A few days before the one-year anniversary of the Aug. 8, 2023, fire, Gov. Josh Green announced that seven defendants accused of causing the tragedy had agreed to pay $4 billion to resolve claims by thousands of people.",
      "Attorneys representing the individual plaintiffs agreed to the deal amid fears that main defendant Hawaiian Electric, the power company blamed for sparking the blaze, could be on the brink of bankruptcy. Other defendants include the state, Maui County and Kamehameha Schools, the largest private landowner in Hawaii.",
      "Victims' attorneys acknowledged that $4 billion wasn't enough to make up for what was lost but said the deal was worth accepting, given Hawaiian Electric's limited assets.",
      "Attorneys for the victims asked Judge Peter Cahill to bar insurance companies from going after the defendants separately to recoup money \u2014 a requirement that was key to the settlement. Cahill agreed, saying insurers could seek reimbursement only from the $4 billion pool the defendants have already agreed to pay.",
      "That didn't sit well with a group of about 200 property and casualty insurers that remain holdouts to the settlement. So far they have paid more than $2.3 billion to people and businesses and expect to pay $1 billion more. They want to be able to pursue their own claims against the defendants.",
      "Cahill has asked the state high court questions about subrogation, or how insurance companies can go about recouping money.",
      "Among the issues before the court is whether state laws controlling health care insurance reimbursement also apply to casualty and property insurance in limiting companies' ability to pursue independent legal action against those held liable.",
      "It's not clear when the justices will issue a ruling.",
      "A last-minute deal between victims' lawyers last week averted a separate trial over how to split the $4 billion between individual plaintiffs and others covered by a class-action lawsuit. Some victims had been ready to take the witness stand, while others submitted pre-recorded testimony describing pain made all the more fresh by the recent destruction in Los Angeles.",
      "Common in the insurance industry, subrogation is a legal process that allows an insurance company to pursue a party that caused a covered loss. It's one way companies recover the amount of claims paid to policyholders.",
      "Insurance companies say subrogation is a way to offset costs associated with a catastrophic event so premiums won\u2019t have to go up. The process isn't for natural disasters such as hurricanes, but for when there is someone at fault.",
      "Hawaii's governor has previously denounced subrogation.",
      "When insurance companies collect huge profits and no disasters occur, they don't send refunds back to policyholders, Green noted in comments quoted in court filings. But when a tragedy does happen, they look to recoup their payments to the victims.",
      "\"It\u2019s fundamentally unfair, and they call it subrogation,\u201d he said.",
      "The insurance industry has been unfairly villainized as outsiders taking resources from the community while those responsible for the fires won\u2019t be held accountable, Vincent Raboteau, an attorney representing the insurers, told Cahill during a hearing last year.",
      "Insurance lawyers have said they want to hold the defendants accountable and aren\u2019t trying to get in the way of fire victims getting settlement money.",
      "Origin and cause investigations are \u201ctime-intensive and costly,\" lawyers said in a court brief of insurers who \u201cassume the burden of these investigations,\u201d and take on the risk of those costs.",
      "Insurers promptly paid claims, which are helping victims rebuild, the brief said: \u201cFor many wildfire victims, payment of claims by their insurer provided quick access to desperately needed funds.\u201d",
      "Not for a while.",
      "If the state Supreme Court agrees that an insurance company can sue defendants directly, \u201cthat would likely destroy the global settlement agreement,\u201d said Jacob Lowenthal, an attorney representing individual plaintiffs. The plaintiffs would go back to Cahill's courtroom to figure out trial dates for their lawsuits.",
      "If the justices rule the other way, the settlement could head toward finalization, putting in motion an administrative process for doling out money.",
      "It's possible that whichever side loses will seek review at the U.S. Supreme Court.",

      "PANAMA CITY -- Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Thursday denied the U.S. State Department\u2019s claim that his country had reached a deal allowing U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free.",
      "Mulino said he had told U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Wednesday that he could neither set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them and that he was surprised by the U.S. State Department\u2019s statement suggesting otherwise late Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI completely reject that statement yesterday,\u201d Mulino said during his weekly press conference, adding that he had asked Panama\u2019s ambassador in Washington to dispute the State Department\u2019s statement. He was scheduled to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday.",
      "On Wednesday evening, the U.S. State Department said via X that \u201cU.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the U.S. government millions of dollars a year.\u201d",
      "The Panama Canal Authority put out its own terse statement later Wednesday night saying it had \"not made any adjustments\u201d to the fees.",

      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who met with Mulino and canal administrators and visited the critical trade route earlier this week, said on Thursday from the Dominican Republic that he had no confusion about his discussions with Panama, but \u201cI respect very much the fact that Panama has a process of laws and procedures that they need to follow.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe United States has a treaty obligation to protect the Panama Canal if it comes under attack,\" Rubio said. \"That treaty obligation would have to be enforced by the armed forces of the United States, particularly the U.S. Navy. I find it absurd that we would have to pay fees to transit a zone that we are obligated to protect in a time of conflict.\u201d",
      "Rubio had carried a message from Trump that China\u2019s influence at the canal was unacceptable.",
      "Rubio had told Mulino that Trump believed that China\u2019s presence in the canal area may violate a treaty that led the United States to turn the waterway over to Panama in 1999. That treaty calls for the permanent neutrality of the American-built canal.",
      "Canal administrators said they were open to discussing giving U.S. warships priority in crossing the canal, but did not say they had considered waiving fees.",
      "Mulino said via X that he was scheduled to speak to Trump on Friday.",
      "Since 1998, U.S. warships, including submarines, have transited the Panama Canal 994 times. They accounted for just 0.3% of the canal\u2019s traffic during that period. The canal received $25.4 million in total fees for those crossings, according to data from the canal authority.",
      "The fees charged to U.S. warships and those from other nations are based on the ship\u2019s displacement tonnage, or the weight of the water displaced by the vessel. The measure is different than that used to charge commercial vessels.",
      "Mulino said Thursday that both Panama\u2019s constitution and laws regulating the Canal Authority make clear that neither the government nor the authority can waive fees. \u201cIt\u2019s a constitutional limitation,\u201d he said.",

      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including how the bond market reacts to the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage briefly fell to a 2-year low just above 6% last September, but has been mostly rising since then, echoing a sharp rise in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which was at 3.62% in mid-September, reached 4.79% three weeks ago amid fears inflation may remain stubbornly higher than the Fed\u2019s 2% target. A solid U.S. economy and worries about tariffs and other policies potentially coming from President Donald Trump have also helped push bond yields higher.",

      "A lag of a month or two usually exists between when a contract is signed and when the home sale is finalized, which makes pending home sales a bellwether for future completed home sales.",
      "For those hoping that mortgage rates will retreat significantly, economists say that\u2019s unlikely.",
      "Forecasts mostly call for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6% this year, with some economists including an upper range as high as 6.8%.",
      "The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged last week after cutting it three times in a row to close 2024, a sign of a more cautious approach as the Fed seeks to gauge where inflation is headed and what policies the Trump administration will pursue."

      "U.S. employers added just 143,000 jobs last month, but the jobless rate fell to 4% to start 2025 and the government revised November and December payrolls higher",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. employers added just 143,000 jobs last month, but the jobless rate fell to 4% to start 2025.",
      "The first job report of Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency suggested that he inherited a labor market that is solid but unspectacular. January job creation was down from the 263,000 added in November, and the 307,000 created in December. Economists had expected about 170,000 new jobs in January.",
      "Most Americans still enjoy unusual job security. But for those looking for work, the job hunt has been getting harder as the labor market cools from the red-hot hiring days of 2021-2023.",
      "Average hourly wages rose by 0.5% from December and 4.1% from January 2024, coming in a bit hotter than forecasters had expected \u2013 news that might be disappointing to the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve. The Labor Department also revised payrolls for November and December up by a combined 100,000.",
      "Citing the strong upward revisions from late 2024, Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics wrote that \"There is no cause for concern about the strength of the economy in today\u2019s employment report.'' But they added that the decent hiring over the past three months suggested the Fed will be in no hurry to cut interest rates again after cutting three times in 2024.",
      "Healthcare companies added 44,000 jobs, down from a 2024 average of 57,000. Retailers hired 34,000 workers. And government at all levels added 32,000 jobs. Mining companies shed 8,000 jobs.",
      "The future is cloudier.",
      "A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's plan to push out federal workers by offering them financial incentives, yet a federal hiring freeze that Trump imposed Jan. 20 is a \u201cnegative for employment growth,\u2019\u2019 Bradley Saunders, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a commentary last week. The freeze came after the Labor Department collected the January jobs numbers, so any impact would be revealed in upcoming employment data.",
      "Economists are also worried about Trump\u2019s threat to wage a trade war against other countries. He\u2019s already imposed a 10% tax on imports from China.",
      "Canada and Mexico \u2013 America\u2019s two largest trading partners -- remain in his crosshairs though he gave them a 30-day reprieve from the 25% tariffs he was planning to sock them with on Tuesday, allowing time for negotiations. Trump says that America\u2019s two neighbors and allies haven\u2019t done enough to stem the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl into the United States. Trump is also itching to slap tariffs on the European Union; pointing to America\u2019s deficit in the trade of goods with the EU, which came to $236 billion last year, he says that Europe treats U.S. exporters unfairly.",
      "The tariffs, which are paid by U.S. importers who generally try to pass along the cost to customers, could rekindle inflation \u2013 which has fallen from the four-decade high it reached in mid-2022 but is still stuck above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. If the tariffs push prices higher, the Fed may cancel or postpone the two interest-rate cuts it had forecast for this year. And that would be bad for economic growth and job creation.",
      "The job market has already lost momentum. American payrolls increased by 2 million last year, down from 2.6 million in 2023, 4.6 million in 2022 and a record 7.2 million in 2021 as the economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns. The Labor Department also reports that employers are posting fewer jobs. Monthly job openings have tumbled from a record 12.2 million in March 2022, to 7.6 million in December \u2013 still a decent number by historical standards.",
      "As the labor market cools, American workers are losing confidence in their ability to find better pay or working conditions by changing jobs. The number of people quitting has fallen from a record 4.5 million near the height of the hiring boom in April 2022, to December\u2019s 3.2 million, which is below pre-pandemic levels.",
      "In regular annual revisions, the Labor Department reported Friday that job creation from April 2023 through March 2024 wasn\u2019t as good as originally reported: 589,000 fewer jobs were created over those 12 months. Preliminary estimates, released in August, had suggested the revisions would be bigger \u2014 818,000 jobs.",

      "Federal government payments for subscriptions to media outlets have become the latest target of President Donald Trump's spending hawks",
      "NEW YORK -- Federal government payments to news outlets like Politico, The New York Times and The Associated Press for subscriptions or to license content are in the crosshairs of Trump administration spending hawks, with the president on Thursday calling it potentially \u201cTHE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the latest in a series of skirmishes with the media, long a target of Donald Trump and his supporters. The Defense Department last week evicted NPR, NBC, the Times and Politico from their Pentagon workspaces, and Trump has continued to criticize CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d for its handling of an interview with former opponent Kamala Harris last fall. Free press advocates are also concerned about Trump\u2019s plans for the media outlet Voice of America, whose charter guarantees its editorial freedom.",
      "This time, though, is a bit different. By linking federal government spending to the media, Trump has bundled two of his long-favored political targets into one rhetorical package \u2014 denouncing a common practice as untoward while offering no supporting evidence for his assertions.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the government had paid more than $8 million for Politico subscriptions and that Elon Musk's government efficiency team \u201cis working on canceling those payments.\u201d That quickly set off a social-media maelstrom and a hunt by online sleuths for other evidence of taxpayer spending on the news.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government must stop paying for media subscriptions. Now,\u201d Richard Grenell, Trump's special mission envoy, posted on X.",
      "Trump, on his Truth Social platform, complained about payments to the \u201cFAKE NEWS MEDIA\u201d for creating good stories about Democrats. \u201cDid the New York Times receive money??? Who else did??? THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL,\u201d he wrote.",
      "And at a national prayer breakfast at the Capitol on Thursday morning, Trump touted the efforts to look into the media spending. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them left and right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them. We\u2019re catching them to a point where they don\u2019t know what the heck is going on. They can\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting caught.\u201d",
      "Politico, in a statement to readers from CEO Goli Sheikholeslami and Editor-in-Chief John Harris, said Thursday that it is not getting a government subsidy.",
      "\u201cIt is a transaction \u2014 just as the government buys research, equipment, software and industry reports,\" they said. \"Some online voices are deliberately spreading falsehoods. Let's be clear: Politico has no financial dependence on the government and no hidden agenda. We cover politics and policy \u2014 that's our job.\"",
      "It has not been unusual for governments, federal and state, to subscribe to major media outlets to keep up on important or strategic issues. The U.S. State Department, for example, may depend on international news reporting for clarity on incidents happening in countries where the United States has interests. Specialists in an agency like the Department of Transportation follow trade publications for industry trends.",
      "The Politico Pro service helps government and private sector customers \"track policy, legislation and regulations in real time with news, intelligence and a suite of data products,\" the company said. It would not discuss how many subscriptions it has sold, or the prices.",
      "The New York Times said it earned less than $2 million last year through government subscriptions, which are offered at a discounted rate. Through one arrangement, the Times gives access to more than 1 million active and retired military members and their families.",
      "\u201cThese officials and other public servants are simply seeking to better understand the world through our independent journalism, like millions of other Americans,\u201d spokesman Charlie Stadtlander said.",
      "Musk, also a frequent critic of the mainstream media and the owner of a platform that in many ways competes with it, retweeted one message on X that complained about the AP \u201craking in millions of dollars in government money for years.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot for long,\" Musk added. \u201dThis is obviously a huge waste of taxpayer money.\"",
      "AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said that \u201cthe U.S. government has long been an AP customer \u2014 through both Democratic and Republican administrations. It licenses AP's nonpartisan journalism, just like thousands of news outlets and customers around the world. It's quite common for governments to have contracts with news organizations for their content.\u201d",
      "The outlet would not reveal how much it is earning in federal government contracts.",
      "Separately, Musk's focus on the USAID agency has threatened some $268 million in congressionally-authorized funding aimed at offering training and support to some 6,200 independent journalists working around the world, including in war-torn Ukraine, said the organization Reporters Without Borders.",
      "Denying the money \u201cwill create a vacuum that plays into the hands of propagandists and authoritarian states,\u201d said Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders' USA branch.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada have left many cities along Mexico's northern border in limbo",
      "CIUDAD JU\u00c1REZ, Mexico -- As soon as the sun glints over miles of border fence dividing the United States and Mexico, the engines of cargo trucks packed with auto and computer parts roar to life along border bridges and bleary-eyed workers file into factories to assemble a multitude of products geared toward the U.S. market.",
      "For more than half a century, this daily rhythm has helped fuel the heartbeat of a transnational machine that generated more than $800 billion in trade between the U.S. and Mexico in 2024 alone.",
      "Over the past year, however, President Donald Trump's threatened 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada have plunged manufacturing hubs all along the northern Mexican border into limbo, a state that persists despite a one-month reprieve to which Trump agreed on Monday.",
      "Tariffs would cripple Mexican border economies that are reliant on factories churning out products for the U.S. \u2014 auto parts, medical supplies, computer components, myriad electronics \u2014  and likely thrust the country into a recession, economic forecasters have warned. Some workers wonder how much longer they'll have jobs, while business leaders say the uncertainty has already led many investors to start tightening their purse strings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a conflict between governments and we\u2019re the ones most affected,\u201d said 58-year-old truck driver Carlos Ponce, leaning against his rig at the customs border crossing between Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso, Texas. \u201cTomorrow, who knows what will happen?\u201d",
      "Ponce, who was driving a truck full of car shock absorbers, said he's spent the past 35 years moving goods across the border, just as his father did before him. Now, he's unsure how much longer that will last.",
      "Manufacturing in export-oriented assembly plants known as maquiladoras are the heart of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez's economy, with 97% of its goods going to the U.S., according to figures from Mexico's Economic Ministry.",
      "The factories were born in the 1960s in an attempt to boost economic development in northern Mexico and lower prices for U.S. consumers. The maquiladora program later took off after the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, was signed in 1994. The agreement was supplanted by a similar pact, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, negotiated between the three countries during Trump's first term.",
      "Today, neon signs with the dollar-to-peso exchange rate flash across the city, a reminder of the close ties binding both sides of the border.",
      "\u201cEverything that happens in the United States: its economic, social policy \u2026 directly affects us because companies here in Mexico depend on what they sell in the United States,\u201d said Thor Salayandia, head of his family's auto-parts manufacturing facility in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. \"The United States also needs Mexico to keep manufacturing, but they\u2019re not seeing things like that.\u201d",
      "This week, workers and business leaders alike breathed a sigh of relief when Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced she had negotiated with Trump to delay tariffs one month.",
      "\u201cNow, we're buying time,\u201d Salayandia said.",
      "Workers here assemble everything from auto parts to computer panels to T-shirts emblazoned with the American flag, logos of popular U.S. football teams and slogans such as \u201cProud to be a federal employee.\u201d",
      "Parts can cross the border multiple times before the final product is sold to U.S. consumers. That economic interdependence has left many in the city struggling to imagine a future without it. One U.S. company said it would likely have to move part of its manufacturing in the city to the U.S., but at a sharp cost.",
      "Antonio Ruiz, a compliance officer at Tecma, a U.S. firm that helps foreign companies set up shop along the border, said his was among a number of businesses to call emergency meetings over the weekend as economic forecasters warned that the tariffs could drive Mexico into a recession.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to be prepared for something that has never happened before,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cAs much as you want to prepare for it, the best you can do is prepare to brace yourself in the short term.\u201d",
      "Salayandia and economists warn that any sort of tax could lead to cascading unemployment and rising prices on both sides of the border. In Mexico, they say, it could also spur a rise in violence in border areas by pushing the unemployed into the hands of drug cartels, as well as an increase in Mexican migration to the U.S.",
      "Manuel Sotelo, a leader of Mexico\u2019s National Chamber of Freight Transportation who owns a fleet of trucks that cross the border every day, sees the tariff threats as more of a political power move than a future economic reality.",
      "\"Both countries would be paralyzed,\" said Sotelo, who sat at a desk covered with local newspapers carrying bold headlines on the tariffs, a Trump bobblehead positioned behind him. \u201cLet's say he did slap a 25% tariff (on Mexico), what would they do during the Super Bowl without avocados?\u201d",
      "On the other hand, Sotelo acknowledges that the tariff talk has already inflicted some damage. He and other business leaders say that over the past year they've watched investment dip in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez because of political uncertainty, as investors hesitate to funnel their money into businesses that could collapse with the stroke of a pen in Washington.",
      "While Trump's election has been the primary driver of that uncertainty, June elections in Mexico and a controversial judicial reform carried out by Mexico's governing party have added to it. Sotelo said he saw a 7% drop in business last year, and only expects that to continue until lingering tariff threats are resolved.",
      "One collective of maquiladoras in the city says it has seen at least three factories halt production.",
      "\u201cEvery time we hear this discourse from political leaders, the people running our governments, it sends shock waves through the border,\u201d Salayandia said. \"Because the border is a global thermometer. Our products go all over the world. Those companies will go look in other parts of the world where they offer conditions to keep competing.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Saving the planet is so 2024. Clean energy leaders across the globe are now tailoring their messages to emphasize the greener side of green: wealth-building. It's an idea that sells far better in the new world of nationalism and tycoon leaders.",
      "Messaging from the U.S. renewable energy industry and the United Nations on climate change has typically focused on the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions for the sake of environmental and human health. To bolster the argument, they cite record-shattering heat around the world, the frequent climate disasters costing billions of dollars and the human toll of it all.",
      "But a sharper emphasis on profit potential has become evident as President Donald Trump stormed into office with a flurry of rollbacks to clean energy initiatives and an emphatic declaration of plans to \u201cunleash\u201d oil, gas and mining. In a lobbying blitz in Washington this week, solar, wind, hydropower and other clean-energy interests touted their role in a \u201crobust American energy and manufacturing economy\u201d and sported lapel pins that said \u201cAmerican energy dominance\u201d \u2014 a favorite Trump phrase.",
      "Meanwhile, in a major policy speech Thursday in Brazil, the U.N.'s top climate official played up the $2 trillion flowing into clean-energy projects and recalled a friend telling him that appealing to people\u2019s \u201cbetter angels\u201d only goes so far.",
      "That friend, according to U.N. Climate Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, added: \u201cIn the great horserace of life ... \u2018always back self-interest ... what\u2019s in it for me.' \u201d",
      "It's not that clean energy backers haven't made the case before. But a different landscape, especially in the U.S., stands to make it more potent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very winning message for outreach to conservatives because it\u2019s really true,\u201d said former U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who founded the conservative climate group RepublicEN.org. \u201cIf we play your cards right and lead the world to this, we can create a lot of wealth, create a lot of jobs here in America.\u201d",

      "\"When right-of-center people hear, \u2019you know, you can you make a profit at this' then it makes sense. Otherwise, it\u2019s like, why are people giving stuff away?\" Inglis said.",
      "Jobs especially have long been a big selling point for solar and wind energy and electric cars, but there's a push to not think of self-interest as a dirty word \u2014 and instead to harness it, United Nations officials said. When Stiell mentioned the $2 trillion in his speech for clean energy, he called it \"unstoppable because of the colossal scale of economic opportunity it presents.\u201d",
      "Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who is also a professor of international affairs, said climate change is such a difficult problem, \"if some people feel the need to cater to narrower self-interests which can be bundled into a solution to the problem, why not?\u201d",
      "In letters and at more than 100 congressional meetings this week, industry leaders from the Solar Energy Industries Association, Oceantic Network and other organizations appealed to keep crucial tax incentives in place so their projects can be globally competitive.",
      "The appeal targets lawmakers who might dismiss climate change but be open to an economic rationale, said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which spearheaded a letter.",
      "\u201cIn the past administration, obviously, we emphasized the common interest around climate mitigation,\u201d Stolark said. \u201cThe messaging with this current administration and with the Republicans is shifting more to that energy piece, the economic piece, the jobs piece.",
      "\u201cI think you want to meet an audience where they are, what\u2019s important to them, what\u2019s going to drive the conversation forward.\u201d",
      "Liz Beardsley, senior policy counsel at the U.S. Green Building Council that was part of the sweeping lobbying effort, said the economy has always been a core component of its messages, and that \u201cdoing good is also good for business.\u201d",
      "To Lisa Sachs, director of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, messaging that climate efforts were strictly for the planet was actually disingenuous.",
      "\u201cThe honesty and coherence of the business and financial sectors in making the economic case for the transition is refreshing, at least, after years of doublespeak, greenwashing and confusion,\u201d Sachs said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect strategy from a climate or social perspective, as the private sector cannot on its own fully decarbonize the economy ...

      "In the days after last week's plane collision in Washington, Pete Muntean was a fixture on the air at CNN",
      "NEW YORK -- Summoned from his couch to cover last week's plane disaster in Washington, CNN's Pete Muntean rushed in for the first of 24 live reports over the next 48 hours. At one point, he used a model airplane and helicopter to demonstrate. At another, he called President Trump \u201cunhinged\u201d for speculating that diversity in hiring contributed to the crash.",
      "Even regular viewers may have wondered: Who is Pete Muntean, anyway?",
      "As CNN's aviation correspondent and a pilot who has flown near where the collision that killed 67 people took place, Muntean illustrates the changes in what used to be an important specialty in journalism.",
      "Precise numbers are hard to come by. But simply by the content out there, there are fewer reporters concentrating solely on what is a complex and technical beat, both because of how the business has changed and the relative safety of flying.",
      "\u201cI realized that planes weren't crashing and I needed a new beat,\u201d said Bill Adair, a former reporter who wrote a book, \u201cThe Mystery of Flight 427: Inside a Crash Investigation,\u201d about a 1994 plane crash in western Pennsylvania that killed 132 people. \u201cThat's a good thing.\u201d",
      "Adair switched to politics, and later created the fact-checking website PolitiFact.",
      "Muntean, 36, was born for his job. Both of his parents were pilots, and he kept his passion for aviation even after his mother, Nancy Lynn, died when the plane she was flying in a Virginia air show crashed. Muntean was 18 at the time and witnessed it; he was the show's MC.",
      "Shortly after, he flew his first solo flight. He keeps a plane at a small Maryland airport now and takes to the sky when time allows.",
      "\u201cI don't think I could ever leave it,\u201d he said. \u201cI love flying more than anything, and the next best thing is talking about it.\u201d",
      "Muntean believes a major part of his job is translation, trying to put into plain English terminology that non-pilots can get lost in. He tries not to be glum about tragedies he occasionally needs to cover. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m the guy who makes people afraid of flying,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is a real drag.\u201d",
      "Aviation is his beat, but like many reporters who follow the industry now, it's not his sole area of concentration. He covers transportation in general. Tom Costello covers aviation for NBC News, but he also covers transportation, cybersecurity, space travel and economics. Jon Scott's main job is as a news anchor for Fox News but, as a pilot, he's involved in major aviation stories.",
      "The New York Times splits things up: Niraj Chokshi covers aviation and transportation, Mark Walker follows the National Transporation Safety Board and Christine Chung follows the airline industry from a consumer perspective. David Koenig was airlines writer for The Associated Press until his recent retirement; the AP says his job will be filled.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of good reporters that cover aviation, but they are fewer than ever,\u201d said Jon Ostrower, who has covered the industry for CNN and The Wall Street Journal and is now editor-in-chief of The Air Current, a subscription-based aviation news service.",
      "The news industry's economic struggles means there are less specialists in general in newsrooms. With safety a major component of the aviation beat, the fact that the last major U.S. commercial air crash before last week came in 2009 means there is less to do.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with editors,\u201d Adair said. \u201cIf you have limited resources, there is not a lot of merit in putting a reporter on a beat where things are working well.\u201d",
      "Airline ownership consolidation means there are fewer reporters at regional newspapers knowledgeable about the industry because they have to follow the local company, Ostrower said. That assumes there are even many reporters at hollowed-out newspapers to do that.",
      "There's also much more flight tracking information easily available to the public through services like Flightradar24 and ADS-B Exchange than in years past. While helpful for journalists, that also increases the preponderance of armchair investigators clogging the Internet with less-than-informed theories, Ostrower said. And entities that offered training for reporters on aviation issues, including companies like Boeing and Pratt & Whitney, don't do it anymore, he said.",
      "To some experts, the shrinking of ranks on the aviation beat wasn't necessarily apparent after the Washington crash. Where it's likely to be noticed is in the weeks and months after, when the time comes to closely examine mechanical issues and policies that might need to be changed to prevent a recurrence.",
      "Who will be watching to see what lessons are learned?",
      "\u201cWe've witnessed the dismantling of the department store approach to news,\u201d said veteran science reporter Miles O'Brien. \u201cEveryone has a little boutique now. You can find experts, but it is incumbent upon the consumer to find trusted sources.\u201d",
      "O'Brien and Ostrower have something in common: they've both been laid off by CNN. Cutbacks may have taken O'Brien's regular job, but producers come calling when news happens \u2014 so much so that he was put on a retainer by his old employer.",

The program has completed some major projects but also raised concerns about debt and environmental impact.",
      "Panama\u2019s decision to walk away from it was seen as a concession to the U.S. over the canal after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Panamanian leader Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Sunday that Panama must immediately reduce what President Donald Trump says is Chinese influence over the canal area or face potential retaliation from the United States.",
      "Mulino has rejected pressure from the new U.S. government to discuss ownership of a waterway that is vital to global trade.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has paused the imposition of tariffs on small-value packages arriving from China",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has paused imposing tariffs on small-value packages arriving from China, apparently to give federal agencies time to sort out how to process millions of such shipments that have come through the U.S. border every day without paying taxes.",
      "The executive order, dated Wednesday, didn't say when the pause would end but said it would cease when the Department of Commerce could put in place \u201cadequate systems\u201d to \u201cfully and expediently process and collect tariff revenue.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's just showing we're moving fast, and the implications are not fully understood when some of these regulations are put in place,\u201d said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at the supply chain platform e2open, pointing out that Trump's order affected huge numbers of small packages, many in transit.",
      "\u201cThe volumes are absolutely incredible,\u201d Lash said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, they go from not requiring filing (for tariffs) ... to actually requiring full filing, which is a complicated task.\u201d",
      "Ending tariff exemptions on low-cost packages from China has broad bipartisan support in Washington, and Trump pulled the plug when he raised tariffs on Chinese goods by 10% earlier this week. Goods sent through duty-free packages became subject not only to existing tariffs \u2014 25% for many Chinese products \u2014 but also the new 10%.",
      "It marks another pause on Trump\u2019s policies weeks into his second administration, including orders to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada that were suspended after the two allies took steps to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking.",
      "The U.S. Postal Service, which would be burdened with collecting tariffs on small packages, on Tuesday announced it would not accept parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong, only to reverse the decision the next day. It said it would work with Customs and Border Protection to implement a collection process for the new tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt's one of those things where you put in any change so quickly it catches people unprepared,\u201d Lash said.",
      "Introduced in 1938, the so-called de minimis exception was intended to facilitate the flow of small packages valued at no more than $5, the equivalent of about $106 today. The threshold increased to $200 in 1994 and $800 in 2016. But the rapid rise of cross-border e-commerce, driven by China, has challenged the intent of the decades-old customs exception rule.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to a report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. And the U.S. market has been a major destination.",
      "In 2023, for the first time, more than 1 billion such packages came through U.S. customs, up from 134 million in 2015. By the end of last year, Customs and Border Protection said it was processing about 4 million small shipments a day, many of which came from China through online retail platforms such as Shein and Temu.",
      "Critics said the practice had allowed not only tariff evasion, but also the flow of unsafe products such as counterfeits and illicit drugs into the U.S. Supporters argued that it helped keep prices affordable for U.S. consumers and small businesses.",
      "After Trump threw out the exemption, some analysts noted that the policy shift could lead to higher prices and delivery delays as U.S. customs officials cope with an onslaught of packages to scrutinize.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about millions of packages every week that currently just basically get treated like domestic shipping,\u201d said Neil Saunders, a managing director with research firm GlobalData.",
      "He said Temu has already adjusted by increasing its warehousing capabilities in the U.S. during the past year and shipping products in containers.",
      "Lash said the end to the de minimis exception rule would change the cross-border e-commerce model when tariffs and filing paperwork drive up costs, prompting overseas sellers to turn to bulk shipping.",

      "A judge has ruled that a Georgia railroad can buy land against the will of property owners to build a track",
      "ATLANTA -- A judge has ruled that a Georgia railroad can buy land against the will of property owners to build a track, rebuffing a challenge that a libertarian group hoped could make it harder to use eminent domain to take property.",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Craig Schwall Sr. ruled Tuesday that the Sandersville Railroad could condemn a 200-foot (60-meter) wide strip of property running 4.5 miles (7.3 kilometers) to build a rail line serving a rock quarry and other users. Landowners fighting the railroad had appealed a Georgia Public Service Commission ruling allowing the land taking.",
      "Schwall kept a freeze on construction for now, with landowners saying they would appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.",
      "The case matters because private entities need to condemn private land for railroads and facilities including pipelines and electric transmission lines.",
      "The Sandersville Railroad, owned by an influential Georgia family, wants to connect the quarry to the CSX railroad at Sparta, allowing products to be shipped widely. Sparta is a mostly Black rural town about 85 miles (135 kilometers) southeast of Atlanta in one of Georgia's poorest counties.",
      "Sandersville has agreements to buy some of the 18 parcels it needs. But other owners say losing a strip of property would spoil land they treasure, and that some families have owned for a century.",
      "\u201cEvery day that Sandersville isn\u2019t coming onto our land and starting to build is a good day,\u201d Diane Smith, one of the owners, said in a statement. \u201cBut we won\u2019t rest easy until we know for sure that they\u2019ll never be able to take our land from us.\u201d",
      "Brian Brodrick, a lawyer for the railroad, urged opposed property owners in a Thursday statement \u201cto return to the negotiating table so we can bring new opportunities and channels of trade to all the citizens of Hancock County and the region.\" He said the spur would have \u201cminimal impacts\u201d on neighbors.",
      "Some people in the rural neighborhood think the railroad would enable expansion at a quarry owned by Heidelberg Materials, a publicly traded German firm. They dislike the quarry because it generates noise, dust and truck traffic.",
      "Supporters say if the railroad is built, the quarry will move its operation farther from houses, trains will reduce trucks on roads and the railroad will build berms to shield residents.",
      "Railroads have long had the power of eminent domain, but Georgia law says such land seizures must be for \u201cpublic use.\u201d Opponents targeted the project by saying it would only benefit the quarry. The Sandersville Railroad says there are other users, including a company located at the quarry that blends gravel and asphalt for paving. Several companies have said they would truck products to load them onto the new line, saying they want access to markets served by CSX.",
      "Schwall found the railroad met the public use standard, saying it was necessary for the \u201cfunctioning\u201d of Sandersville and \"also serves a public purpose because it will provide a channel of trade in east middle Georgia.\u201d",
      "The group representing opponents, the Institute for Justice, hoped to use the case to chip away at eminent domain, the power to legally take private land while paying fair compensation.",
      "The libertarian-leaning legal group lost a landmark 2005 case allowing the city of New London, Connecticut, to take land from one private owner and transfer it to another private owner for economic development. Schwall cited that case in his ruling.",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to proving to the courts that a private railroad\u2019s desire to build a speculative new line entirely for the benefit of a handful of private companies is not a public use under the U.S. and Georgia constitutions and Georgia\u2019s eminent domain laws,\u201d Institute for Justice attorney Bill Maurer said in statement."

      "Multiple studies have extolled the benefits of napping, such as enhanced memory and focus. A mid-afternoon siesta is the norm in parts of Spain and Italy. In China and Japan, nodding off is encouraged since working to the point of exhaustion is seen as a display of dedication, according to a study in the journal Sleep.",
      "Yet it's hard to catch a few z's during regular business hours in the United States, where people who nap can be viewed as lazy. The federal government even bans sleeping in its buildings while at work, except in rare circumstances.",
      "Individuals who are willing and able to challenge the status quo are becoming less hesitant to describe the payoffs of taking a dose of microsleep. Marvin Stockwell, the founder of PR firm Champion the Cause, takes short naps several times a week.",
      "\u201cThey rejuvenate me in a way that I\u2019m exponentially more useful and constructive and creative on the other side of a nap than I am when I\u2019m forcing myself to gut through being tired,\u201d Stockwell said.",
      "Sleep is as important to good health as diet and exercise, but too many people don\u2019t get enough of it, according to James Rowley, program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at Rush University Medical Center.",
      "\u201cA lot of it has to do with electronics. It used to be TVs, but now cellphones are probably the biggest culprit. People just take them to bed with them and watch,\u201d Rowley said.\u201d",
      "Napping isn\u2019t common in academia, where there\u2019s constant pressure to publish, but University of Southern California lecturer Julianna Kirschner fits in daytime naps when she can. Kirschner studies social media, which she says is designed to deliver a dopamine rush to the brain. Viewers lose track of time on the platforms, interrupting sleep. Kirschner says she isn\u2019t immune to this problem \u2014 hence, her occasional need to nap.",
      "The key to effective napping is to keep the snooze sessions short, Rowley said. Short naps can be restorative and are more likely to leave you more alert, he said.",
      "\u201cMost people don\u2019t realize naps should be in the 15- to 20-minute range,\u201d Rowley said. \u201cAnything longer, and you can have problems with sleep inertia, difficulty waking up, and you\u2019re groggy.\u201d",
      "Individuals who find themselves consistently relying on naps to make up for inadequate sleep should probably also examine their bedtime habits, he said.",
      "Mid-afternoon is the ideal time for a nap because it coincides with a natural circadian dip, while napping after 6 p.m. may interfere with nocturnal sleep for those who work during daylight hours, said Michael Chee, director of the Centre for Sleep and Cognition at the National University of Singapore..",
      "\u201cAny duration of nap, you will feel recharged. It\u2019s a relief valve. There are clear cognitive benefits,\u201d Chee said.",
      "A review of napping studies suggests that 30 minutes is the optimal nap length in terms of practicality and benefits, said Ruth Leong, a research fellow at the Singapore center.",
      "\u201cWhen people nap for too long, it may not be a sustainable practice, and also, really long naps that cross the two-hour mark affect nighttime sleep,\u201d Leong said.",
      "Experts recommend setting an alarm for 20 to 30 minutes, which gives nappers a few minutes to fall asleep.",
      "But even a six-minute nap can be restorative and improve learning, said Valentin Dragoi, scientific director of the Center for Neural Systems Restoration, a research and treatment facility run by Houston Methodist hospital and Rice University.",
      "While workplace dozing is uncommon in the U.S., some companies and managers encourage it. Will Bryk, founder of AI search startup Exa, swears by 20-minute power naps and ordered two sleeping pods for employees to use in his company's San Francisco office.",
      "Ice cream maker Ben & Jerry\u2019s has had a nap room in its Vermont headquarters for a couple of decades, and a handful of employees use it, company spokesman Sean Greenwood said. \u201cEmployees who feel taken care of are much more likely to use this responsibly,\" he said.",
      "Arianna Huffington, the celebrity author who co-founded news website Huffington Post, became an advocate of a good night\u2019s sleep and occasional naps after she collapsed from exhaustion in 2007. She installed a nap room at her former company, now called HuffPo, and at Thrive Global, a wellness technology company where she serves as founder and CEO.",
      "\u201cIf people have been up all night because of a sick child or a delayed flight, if they have the opportunity to nap, ... then they will be much more productive and creative for the rest of the day instead of dragging themselves or trying to boost their energy through multiple coffee or cinnamon buns,\u201d Huffington said in an email.",
      "Kirsten Perez, 33, is a devoted napper. She used to use her lunch break at work to catch a few winks in her car. When she got her own office, she closed the door for an afternoon siesta while sitting at her desk.",
      "Nowadays, working from home as a marketing manager at Nvidia, the Atlanta resident usually takes her daily nap in bed. She sets an alarm for 15 minutes, falls asleep within a minute and wakes up 30 seconds before the alarm rings.",
      "\u201cI can tell when my reasoning, my mood are dropping, just kind of feeling the drag of the day,\u201d Perez said. In those situations, she asks herself, \u201c\u2018Do I have a chunk of time in the next hour or so?\u2019 And then I\u2019ll figure out when I can find 15 minutes and find myself horizontal.\u201d",
      "Naps are accepted and even a necessity in some occupations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages naps for nurses working night shifts. But many nurses can't sleep at the hospitals where they work because they're too busy and aren't given access to beds.",
      "Nurses \"regularly struggle to have sufficient time to use the bathroom or go outside for fresh air, no less take a nap,\" Michelle Morris, spokesperson for the National Nurses United union, said.",
      "Some companies are trying to fill the void. Inspired by his mother who worked as a nurse, Neil Wong founded Nap York, which offers sleeping pods in Manhattan and Queens that can be rented for about $27 an hour.",
      "His regular customers include super-commuters, UPS drivers, a security guard who works two full-time jobs, and doctors who work at nearby hospitals. Nap York also gives half-off prices to essential workers such as police officers, firefighters and emergency medical service personnel.",
      "\u201cIn this society, you really only have two place to sleep: you have your bed at home and you have a hotel room you can probably get for 100 bucks,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no third space that\u2019s quiet, that provides some privacy, where you can also rest.\u201d"

      "American importers have been stockpiling the popular Italian bubbly Prosecco as a hedge against the possible impact of tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump",
      "ROME -- American importers have been stockpiling Italian bubbly Prosecco as a hedge against the possible impact of tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump, wine industry data show.",
      "U.S. imports of Italian sparkling wine \u2014 90% of that Prosecco \u2014 skyrocketed by 41% in November, after Trump's election, far exceeding consumer demand as importers filled the pipeline for future sales, according to the Union of Italian Wines trade association.",
      "\u201cIt was quite natural at the end of the year to do extra shipments,\u201d said the trade association president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, given the uncertainty over whether tariffs would hit Italian wines or not \u2014 and the likelihood consumers would cut back on such luxuries if tariffs made them too pricey.",
      "\u201cCan we survive without a glass of wine? Yes. Wine is a pleasure,\u2019\u2019 Frescobaldi told The Associated Press this week.",
      "Italian wines were not hit by tariffs during the first Trump presidency, and no tariffs have been announced to date against European partners. Still, Prosecco importers and distributors are taking precautionary measures to protect the market.",
      "Italy exports nearly one-quarter of its wine to the United States, leaving the sector more heavily exposed to possible tariffs than any other Italian export, according to the trade federation. Last year, Italy\u2019s wine exports to the U.S. totaled 1.9 billion euros ($1.97 billion).",
      "Prosecco became the top-selling Italian wine in the United States last year, representing nearly 40% of all sales.",
      "The first signs of market concern showed up even before Trump was elected, with Prosecco shipments to the United States increasing 17% in the first 10 months of 2024. That compares with more modest single-digit increases to the next two markets, Britain and Germany, and far outpacing U.S. consumption which rose just 0.6% in the period.",
      "\u201cIt is an important figure that we did not expect,'' said Giancarlo Guidolin, president of Prosecco DOC consortium, the largest of Italy's three Prosecco-producing consortia. \u201dWe think there was an increase of product in the warehouse.''",
      "One other factor in the higher deliveries may have been a threatened port strike in January, said Dina Opici, chairwoman of the Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America.",
      "\u201cThat said, obviously taking into consideration that there could be impending tariffs as well, I think it probably gave people a higher comfort level in making that investment,'' Opici said.",

      "This year\u2019s Super Bowl commercials are going for laughs, with advertisers betting that viewers need a diversion from weighty matters",
      "Most of the commercials airing during this year\u2019s Super Bowl are going for laughs, with advertisers betting that America could use a brief diversion.",
      "As the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs hit the field in New Orleans, a parade of silly ads will hit airwaves on Sunday. Many companies put their ads online ahead of the game, but some held out to maintain an element of surprise.",
      "Humor dominates in the ads released so far. Four old ladies go on a joy ride with WeatherTech, while Eugene Levy's eyebrows fly off and buzz around after he eats some Little Caesars. Sloths have a case of the Mondays in an ad for Coors Light. A man's tongue starts dancing to celebrate cold foam from Nestl\u00e9 Coffee Mate. British singer Seal becomes an actual seal, sad that he can't hold Mountain Dew with his flippers.",
      "Actor Glenn Powell does a take on Goldilocks for Ram Trucks, while comedian Nate Bargatze clones himself and hires an opera singer because he saved so much money using DoorDash. Shaboozey takes a lighthearted stroll through New Orleans for Nerds, while the stars of the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d franchise take a slow cruise in a convertible so they can enjoy H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream bars.",
      "Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, said this was a complicated Super Bowl for advertisers.",
      "Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, Calkins said. The finalized crop of commercials feature a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,\u201d Calkins said. \u201cSafe advertising isn\u2019t the advertising you notice or remember.\u201d",
      "And advertisers can't afford not to be noticed. Some of the roughly 80 Super Bowl ads spots cost a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year.",
      "Here are some of the themes of this year's Super Bowl ads:",
      "Budweiser brings back its Clydesdales for its Super Bowl ad, including a foal that wants to join the delivery team. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reenact their famous scene from 1989's \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally,\u201d except this time Sally is expressing her enthusiasm for Hellmann's mayonnaise.",
      "The Muppets search for accommodations with Booking.com, while an Instacart ad features a parade of familiar mascots like Mr. Clean, the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. Disney asks what the world would be like without the iconic characters it owns, like Elsa from \u201cFrozen,\u201d Bart Simpson and the Marvel superheroes.",
      "Advertisers are leaning on nostalgia more than they used to in Super Bowl ads, according to Kimberly Whitler, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business. Nods to the past can broaden the appeal of an ad to different generations and connect products to positive cultural moments, she said.",
      "Putting celebrities together in unexpected combinations can also broaden the appeal of a commercial. In their Super Bowl ad for Michelob Ultra, Catherine O'Hara and Willem Dafoe are pickleball champs. Soccer star David Beckham and actor Matt Damon are long-lost twins who bond over Stella Artois. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and comedian Pete Davidson team up for a HexClad commercial, while Post Malone, Shane Gillis and Peyton Manning have a block party with Bud Light. A slew of celebrities, including Matthew McConaughey, Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig and Charlie XCX, appear in an ad for Uber Eats.",
      "Linli Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Carlson School of Management, said celebrity endorsements can get people talking. But with dozens of brands using them, there's a risk of diminishing returns.",
      "Celebrities can also get so much attention that viewers don\u2019t remember which brand they're advertising, Xu said.",
      "\u201cThere is a balancing act in terms of having celebrities in the ads,\u201d she said.",
      "It isn't all fun and games at the Super Bowl this year. Pharmaceutical company Novartis urges women to get early detection for breast cancer. Dove warns that half of girls who quit sports have been criticized for their body type. Hims & Hers, a telehealth company, talks about America's obesity epidemic. And the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded by New England Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft, has a stark ad featuring Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady saying what they hate about each other.",
      "Xu said she expected more ads promoting that unifying message. But for the most part, advertisers went with humor, she said.",
      "\u201cWe just had an election year and there\u2019s a lot of discussion around divisiveness,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople might be wanting to see some unity, everybody coming together as a country.\u201d",
      "Several Super Bowl ads make the case for AI as a helpmate. Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner team up for an ad wearing Meta 's smart glasses, which use artificial intelligence to answer questions about what wearers are seeing. Actor Walton Goggins pitches GoDaddy Airo, which uses AI to help build websites and social content. And Google's \u201c50 States, 50 Stories\u201d campaign will show viewers a small business from their state that's using Google's Gemini AI assistant. But Cirkul, a water bottle brand, pokes fun at AI, showing comedian Adam Devine accidentally ordering 100,000 bottles using the AI assistant on his phone.",

      "Two rare black wolves have been spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Two rare black wolves, likely siblings, were spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest, a conservation organization said Sunday.",
      "The unusual sighting, captured last year on a video camera set up by SAVE Wildlife Conservation Fund Poland project coordinator Joanna Toczyd\u0142owska, has prompted the organization to collect scat (droppings) in the forest in the hopes of learning more about the black wolves' genetics.",
      "\u201cIt's something new and unusual,\u201d Toczyd\u0142owska told The Associated Press.",
      "Toczyd\u0142owska initially placed the camera to study beavers. When she noticed she was recording wolves instead, she kept the camera there and collected the black wolf footage a few weeks ago.",
      "In one clip, a black wolf and a gray wolf slowly crossed a stream in the forest, the water nearly up to their bellies, before they leap onto the bank. A second clip, taken last fall, records two black wolves and a gray wolf fording the same stream.",
      "Most of the 2,5000 to 3,000 wolves in Poland are gray with red or black accents. Black fur comes from a genetic mutation that was likely in domesticated dogs thousands of years ago. The dark fur is rare in Europe due to a reduced genetic diversity, but at least half of the wolf population has black fur in Yellowstone National Park in the United States.",
      "Because wolves travel in families and both black wolves were around 30 kilograms (66 lbs) \u2014 roughly the size of a German shepherd \u2014 Toczyd\u0142owska said they were likely siblings and roughly a year old. At least one is male.",
      "The conservation organization, which has been monitoring wolves in Poland for 13 years, is not disclosing the forest's location to keep the wolves safe from poaching and prevent misinformation about wolves from spreading.",
      "Wolves were essentially extinct in Poland by the 1950s, but the population has been reintroduced in recent years, especially in central part of the country in the early 2000s. Toczyd\u0142owska and her colleagues teach other the public how to safely live in areas inhabited by wolfpacks.",
      "\u201cFor people, it is a new phenomenon,\u201d Roman Gula, head of the organization's wolf monitoring project, told the AP. \"Education is one of our major, major goals.\"",
      "The conservation fund announced the sighting last week on Facebook and asked for financial support to pay for the scat's genetic testing to learn more about the black-fur mutation.",

      "It's a recipe you can test for yourself \u2014 though the timing isn't ideal with soaring egg prices in the United States from a bird flu outbreak.",
      "The perfect boiled egg has a velvety yolk paired with a soft, solid white.",
      "Achieving this balance can be a challenge because the yolk cooks at a lower temperature than the white. Hard boiling an egg can yield a chalky yolk, while cooking low and slow can produce jelly-like, undercooked whites.",
      "Researchers cooked hundreds of eggs and used math to tackle this runny conundrum. One equation dealt with how heat travels between a hot surface and an egg; another captured how the egg's contents morph from liquid to solid with a gel-like state in between.",
      "Their final recipe involves transferring eggs in a steamer basket every two minutes between two bowls of water \u2014 one boiling and the other lukewarm at 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) \u2014 for a total of 32 minutes before cooling under running water and peeling.",
      "\u201cYou could definitely do this at home with half a dozen eggs or so,\" said Gregory Weiss, a chemist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved with the research.",
      "In the method proposed by the researchers, dubbed periodic cooking, the egg whites heated and cooled until fully set. The yolk, on the other hand, held firm at a constant temperature and cooked until creamy.",
      "\u201cYou can almost spread it, like on bread,\u201d said study author Emilia Di Lorenzo from the University of Naples Federico II.",

      "Brazilian students returned to class this week with a new task: staying away from their smartphones under a new law restricting the use of devices in schools",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian students returned to class this week with a new task: staying away from their smartphones as a new law restricting their use in schools took effect.",
      "President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva signed a bill in January limiting smartphone access at schools, in line with a trend seen in the U.S. and Europe. It applies to public and private schools, and applies to classrooms and the halls.",
      "Phones are still allowed for educational purposes, with the teacher\u2019s permission, and when needed for the student's accessibility and health. Schools can set their own guidelines, such as whether students can keep phones in backpacks or store them in lockers or designated baskets.",
      "Before the federal law, most of Brazil's 26 states \u2014 including Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias \u2014 had already applied some restrictions to phone use in schools. As of 2023, nearly two-thirds of Brazilian schools had some limitations, with 28% banning them entirely, according to a survey last year by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "But rules varied between states and between schools, and authorities and administrators struggled with enforcement.",
      "That may have contributed to support for federal legislation from across the political spectrum \u2014 both allies of leftist Lula and the far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents wanted to ban smartphone use by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",
      "Porto Seguro, a nearly 150-year-old private school in Sao Paulo, prohibited smartphones in classrooms last year and encouraged students to disconnect completely once a week. This year, it expanded its ban to include hallways, requiring students to keep their phones in lockers for the entire school day, including breaks.",
      "\u201cStudents were having trouble concentrating,\" school principal Meire Nocito said in an interview Thursday. \u201cThere was also the issue of social isolation. Many students who used technology excessively would isolate themselves during breaks, interacting only through social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cBanning cellphone use has helped create a space for social interaction, fostering relationships and teaching students to navigate conflicts, which are a natural part of human interactions. It has been very positive,\u201d she added.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Education said in a statement Monday that the restriction aims to protect students\u2019 mental and physical health while promoting more rational use of technology.",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, which is among one of the world\u2019s highest rates of use.",
      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",
      "Cell phone bans have gained traction across the United States, where eight states have passed laws or policies that ban or restrict cellphone use to try to curb student phone access and minimize distractions in classrooms.",
      "An increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids jeopardizes their safety and mental health.",
      "A report published in September by the U.N.'s Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO, said one in four countries has already restricted the use of such devices at schools.",
      "Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized used a U.S. Senate hearing last year to apologize to parents of children exploited, bullied or driven to self harm via social media. He also noted Meta\u2019s continued investments in \u201cindustrywide\u201d efforts to protect children.",
      "Mariana Waetge, a 13-year-old student at Porto Seguro, has owned a smartphone for five years. She uses it to communicate with friends and family and to find entertainment on social media, especially Instagram. Being forced to stay away from her phone made her find new ways to interact with friends, improved her focus and even strengthened her relationship with her family.",
      "The restriction also helped \"include people who didn\u2019t have many friends and would use their phones to hide from making new friends or to avoid being out there,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cNow they don\u2019t have that option anymore.

      "And United Therapeutics, another developer of gene-edited pig organs, just won FDA approval for the world\u2019s first clinical trial of xenotransplantation. Initially, six patients will receive pig kidneys \u2014 and if they fare well over six months, up to 50 additional patients will receive transplants.",
      "\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d said Mass General\u2019s Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, who led both Andrews\u2019 surgery and the world\u2019s first pig kidney transplant last year. But with lessons from animal research and the prior human attempts, he said, \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic. And hopefully we can get to survival, kidney survival, for over two years.\u201d",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address the transplant shortage. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Andrews\u2019 kidneys abruptly failed about two years ago, and the Concord, New Hampshire, grandfather struggled with fatigue and complications from dialysis. He\u2019s on the transplant list but doctors warned it was a long shot. It can take seven years or more for people with Andrews\u2019 blood type to find a matching kidney. Meanwhile, people slowly get sicker on dialysis \u2014 five-year survival is about 50% \u2014 and Andrews already had had a heart attack.",
      "\u201cI have seen my mortality and I was ready to fight,\u201d Andrews said. So he asked Mass General if he could get a pig kidney instead. \u201cI told them. \u2018Anything, I\u2019ll do anything. You give me a list of things you want me to do and I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mass General transplant nephrologist Dr. Leonardo Riella said Andrews was weak and struggling with diabetes, including a slow-healing diabetic foot ulcer that hindered walking. He\u2019d have to get more fit to be a candidate.",
      "Andrews started physical therapy and returned six months later about 30 pounds lighter and \u201crunning down the hallway almost,\u201d Riella recalled. \u201cHe was just, you know, a different person,\u201d so they started checking if he\u2019d qualify for the pilot study.",
      "One big question was cardiac fitness: Mass General\u2019s first pig kidney recipient had underlying heart disease that killed him. But Riella said intense exams showed Andrews\u2019 \u201cheart was in the best shape possible.\u201d",
      "Still, Andrews was a little nervous and sought advice from the only other person who knew what a pig kidney transplant was like \u2014 the NYU patient, Towana Looney.",
      "\u201cWe just prayed together and talked about how it would be,\u201d Andrews said of their phone calls before and after his transplant. He said Looney advised \u201cto just stay strong and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d",
      "Doctors said Andrews' pig kidney turned pink and quickly began producing urine in the operating room, and since then has cleared waste normally with no signs of rejection. Andrews spent the week after his discharge in a nearby Boston hotel for daily checkups but is expected to return home to New Hampshire soon.",
      "NYU transplant surgeon Dr. Robert Montgomery said patients like those in Mass General\u2019s pilot study could be \u201cthe sweet spot\u201d for early xenotransplants \u2014 not yet too sick from years of dialysis but unlikely to survive long enough for a human transplant.",
      "\u201cThose are the patients where it really makes sense for them to try something else,\u201d said Montgomery. His hospital is one of two that will be part of United Therapeutics\u2019 clinical trial later this year, which will include similar patients.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know how Andrews will fare but if the pig kidney were to fail, Riella said he\u2019d still qualify for a human transplant and, now deemed inactive on the transplant list, wouldn\u2019t lose his \u201cwaiting time\u201d that helps determine priority.",
      "Andrews now wants to return to his old dialysis clinic and \u201ctell these people there\u2019s hope, because no hope is not a good thing,\u201d he said.",

      "Google is scrapping some of its diversity hiring targets, joining a lengthening list of U.S. companies that have been abandoning or scaling back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google is scrapping some of its diversity hiring targets, joining a lengthening list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "The move, which was outlined in an email sent to Google employees on Wednesday, came in the wake of an executive order issued by President Donald Trump that was aimed in part at pressuring government contractors to scrap their DEI initiatives.",
      "Like several other major tech companies, Google sells some of its technology and services to the federal government, including its rapidly growing cloud division that\u2019s a key piece of its push into artificial technology.",
      "Google's parent company, Alphabet, also signaled the shift in its annual 10-K report it filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In it, Google removed a line included in previous annual reports saying that it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.\u201d",
      "Google generates most of Alphabet's annual revenue of $350 billion and accounts for almost all of its worldwide workforce of 183,000.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities, and over the last year we\u2019ve been reviewing our programs designed to help us get there,\" Google said in a statement to The Associated Press. \"We\u2019ve updated our 10-K language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.\u201d",
      "The change in language also comes slightly more than two weeks after Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other prominent technology executives \u2014 including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 stood behind Trump during his inauguration.",
      "Meta jettisoned its DEI program last month, shortly before the inauguration, while Amazon halted some of its DEI programs in December following Trump's election.",
      "Many companies outside of the technology industry also have backed away from DEI. Those include Walt Disney Co., McDonald's, Ford, Walmart, Target, Lowe's and John Deere.",
      "Trump's recent executive order threatens to impose financial sanctions on federal contractors deemed to have \u201cillegal\u201d DEI programs. If the companies are found to be in violation, they could be subject to massive damages under the 1863 False Claims Act. That law states that contractors that make false claims to the government could be liable for three times the government\u2019s damages.",
      "The order also directed all federal agencies to choose the targets of up to nine investigations of publicly traded companies, large non-profits and other institutions with DEI policies that constitute \u201cIllegal discrimination or preference.\u201d",
      "The challenge for companies is knowing which DEI policies the Trump administration may decide are \u201cillegal.\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order seeks to \u201cterminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs\u201d and other activities of the federal government, and to compel federal agencies \u201cto , combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.\u201d",
      "In both the public and private sector, diversity initiatives have covered a range of practices, from anti-discrimination training and conducting pay equity studies to making efforts to recruit more members of minority groups and women as employees.",
      "Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, has tried to hire more people from underrepresented groups for more than a decade but stepped up those efforts in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis triggered an outcry for more social justice.",
      "Shortly after Floyd died, Pichai set a goal to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in the Mountain View, California, company's largely Asian and white leadership ranks by 30% by 2025. Google has made some headway since then, but the makeup of its leadership has not changed dramatically.",
      "The representation of Black people in the company's leadership ranks rose from 2.6% in 2020 to 5.1% last year, according to Google's annual diversity report. For Hispanic people, the change was 3.7% to 4.3%. The share of women in leadership roles, meanwhile, increased from 26.7% in 2020 to 32.8% in 2024, according to the company's report.",
      "The numbers aren't much different in Google's overall workforce, with Black employees comprising just 5.7% and Latino employees 7.5%. Two-thirds of Google's worldwide workforce is made up of men, according to the diversity report.",

      "Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period, but its stocks dipped in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance for the current quarter.",
      "The Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared with the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.",

      "Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.",
      "Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.",
      "Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.",
      "Sales for Amazon Web services, the company\u2019s prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.",
      "Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence.

It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.",
      "In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023.

      "The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company\u2019s shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon\u2019s answer to Shein and Temu.",
      "Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China."

    "story": [
      "Lawmakers in the House are proposing to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from U.S. government devices",
      "WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan duo in the the U.S. House is proposing legislation to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from federal devices, similar to the policy already in place for the popular social media platform TikTok.",
      "Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Darin LaHood, R-Ill., on Thursday introduced the \u201cNo DeepSeek on Government Devices Act,\" which would ban federal employees from using the Chinese AI app on government-owned electronics. They cited the Chinese government's ability to use the app for surveillance and misinformation as reasons to keep it away from federal networks.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party has made it abundantly clear that it will exploit any tool at its disposal to undermine our national security, spew harmful disinformation, and collect data on Americans,\" Gottheimer said in a statement. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t risk the CCP infiltrating the devices of our government officials and jeopardizing our national security.\"",
      "The proposal comes after the Chinese software company in January published an AI model that performed at a competitive level with models developed by American firms like OpenAI, Meta, Alphabet and others. DeepSeek purported to develop the model at a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts. The announcement raised alarm bells and prompted debates among policymakers and leading Silicon Valley financiers and technologists.",
      "The churn over AI is coming at a moment of heightened competition between the U.S. and China in a range of areas, including technological innovation. The U.S. has levied tariffs on Chinese goods, restricted Chinese tech firms like Huawei from being used in government systems and banned the export of state of the art microchips thought to be needed to develop the highest end AI models.",
      "Last year, Congress and then-President Joe Biden approved a divestment of the popular social media platform TikTok from its Chinese parent company or face a ban across the U.S.; that policy is now on hold. President Donald Trump, who originally proposed a ban of the app in his first term, signed an executive order last month extending a window for a long term solution before the legally required ban takes effect.",
      "In 2023, Biden banned TikTok from federal-issued devices.",
      "\u201cThe technology race with the Chinese Communist Party is not one the United States can afford to lose,\u201d LaHood said in a statement. \u201cThis commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation will ban the app from federal workers\u2019 phones while closing backdoor operations the company seeks to exploit for access. It is critical that Congress safeguard Americans\u2019 data and continue to ensure American leadership in AI.\u201d",
      "The bill would single out DeepSeek and any AI application developed by its parent company, the hedge fund High-Flyer, as subject to the ban. The legislation includes exceptions for national security and research purposes that would allow federal employers to study DeepSeek.",
      "Some lawmakers wish to go further. A bill proposed last week by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., would bar the import of export of any AI technology from China writ large, citing national security concerns."

      "\u201cWe have always tried to be a company that will be loved wherever we do our business. That has never waffled,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Yoichi Miyazaki told reporters without addressing the tariffs.",
      "Also Wednesday, Toyota reported fiscal third quarter profit jumped 61% from the previous fiscal year to 2.19 trillion yen ($14 billion), on 12.4 trillion yen ($81 billion) sales, up 3% on-year.",
      "Toyota officials said sales were recovering from the drop earlier this fiscal year after some production was suspended over a certification scandal in Japan.",
      "Last year, Toyota acknowledged wide-ranging fraudulent testing, including the use of inadequate or outdated data in crash tests, incorrect testing of airbag inflation and engine power checks. The wrongdoing did not affect the safety of the vehicles, and only affected production in Japan.",
      "Toyota revised its profit forecast for the full fiscal year through March 2025 to 4.5 trillion yen ($29 billion) from the previous projection for a 3.6 trillion yen ($24 billion) profit, thanks to the positive effect of the foreign exchange rate and cost reduction efforts. The new projection still falls short of what Toyota racked up the previous fiscal year at 4.9 trillion yen.",
      "The new company in China is part of Toyota\u2019s drive to meet the high demand for EVs in China, according to Toyota. Toyota already has China FAW Group Co. and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. as its longtime partners in China, and those will continue unchanged, he said.",
      "Toyota said it hopes to contribute to the Chinese government\u2019s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.",
      "\u201cLocal Chinese members will take the lead in planning and developing BEVs that match the unique needs of Chinese customers. Our goal is to become a company that is more loved and supported by the people of China,\u201d said Miyazaki.",

      "Researchers across the country are in \u201ca mad scramble\u201d to sort out what public data the Trump administration has deleted from government websites",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers are in what one described as \u201ca mad scramble\u201d to sort out what public data the Trump administration has deleted from government websites and electronic publications.",
      "Late last week, federal agencies took down scores of government webpages as staffers hurried to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s order rolling back protections for transgender people, which required the removal of \u201cgender ideology\u201d language from websites, contracts and emails.",
      "Some of the sites were back online Monday, but data analysts say it's not clear exactly what was removed or changed.",
      "\u201cYou go looking for something and it's just not there,\u201d said Amy O'Hara, a Georgetown University researcher who is president of the Association of Public Data Users.",
      "Social science researchers and other federal data users on Monday described feeling like a five-alarm fire was triggered when they discovered late last week that vital federal datasets were inaccessible.",
      "It sparked \u201ca mad scramble right now\u201d to grab copies of whatever federal data was posted before, O'Hara said.",
      "While the administration's stated goal was to delete gender and transgender terminology, O'Hara said some researchers worry that other politically charged topics \u2014 such as climate change or vaccines \u2014 might be removed or altered.",
      "A expert panel affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention demanded a meeting on the deletions.",
      "The committee, chartered by Congress to advise the CDC director, asked the agency's acting director, Susan Monarez, for an explanation about why it had cut off access to datasets \u201cthat allow people across the country to understand the health of their communities.\u201d",
      "The panel had yet to receive a response, said committee member Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a former federal health official who is now a health policy expert at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Experts say datasets and summaries were affected, but so too were codebooks that explain different variables. They say they also saw changes to published research that used affected datasets, and even redactions to lists of publications about certain topics.",
      "\u201cThe scale of this is quite stunning,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "Researchers are still stumbling on what was taken down or changed, she added.",
      "\u201cWe are finding out about omissions when somebody goes searching for it,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "On Monday, for instance, when a query was made to access certain data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s most comprehensive survey of American life, users got a response that said the area was \u201cunavailable due to maintenance.\u201d",
      "The CDC\u2019s official public portal for health data, data.cdc.gov, was taken down entirely on Friday but went back up over the weekend, albeit with a yellow ribbon at the top saying: \u201cCDC\u2019s website is being modified to comply with President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders.\u201d The agency's Youth Risk Behavior Survey data was restored too, but with at least one of the gender columns missing and its data documentation removed.",
      "CDC officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. statistical system is considered the best in the world and researchers fear that the removals will undermine trust and put the integrity of the data at risk.",
      "\u201cThis sets a really dangerous precedent that any administration can come in and delete whatever they don\u2019t like,\u201d said Beth Jarosz, a senior program director at the Population Reference Bureau. \u201cRegardless of your politics, this should alarm you since this is taxpayer-funded data and it belongs to the public.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement, the presidents of the Population Association of America and the Association of Population Centers called the takedowns \u201cunacceptable\u201d and called on Congress and the Trump administration to restore the datasets.",
      "Paul Schroeder, executive director of the Council of Professional Associations on Federal Statistics, said people looking for data may have to resort to suing for access or submitting Freedom of Information Act requests for the datasets.",
      "\u201cThe removal of several public datasets from agency websites goes against everything the statistical agencies stand for and were intended for,\u201d Schroeder said Monday. \u201cPublic data users are being left in the dark about what is going on.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products",
      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products, from the ultra-cheap apparel sold on online shopping platforms to toys and electronic devices such as computers and cellphones.",
      "An additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods took effect Tuesday, while the U.S. Postal Service announced it will stop accepting parcels inbound from China and Hong Kong until further notice.",
      "The previous day, President Donald Trump agreed to pause his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days following negotiations on Trump's demands for the North American nations to take steps to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "After failing to get a similar White House reprieve, China struck back with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods that are set to begin next week.",
      "The sheer volume and variety of the China-made merchandise sold in the U.S. means residents would probably see the prices of many typically inexpensive items tick higher if the tit-for-tat tariffs persist.",
      "These are some of the products most likely to be impacted:",
      "The U.S. imported about $427 billion worth of goods from China in 2023, the most recent year with complete data, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consumer electronics, including cellphones, computers and other tech accessories, make up the biggest import categories.",
      "China is a dominant production engine for tech gear, including for American companies like Apple that have their products assembled in the country. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, the Consumer Technology Association trade group reported.",
      "The tariffs also may affect how much consumers pay for typically inexpensive clothing, shoes and kitchen items like pots and pans, as well as the big-ticket items, such as appliances, furniture and auto parts.",
      "Jay Salaytah, 43, who runs his own auto repair shop in Detroit, said he bought some pieces of equipment sooner than he might have, anticipating they would cost more if Trump implemented his campaign promise to use import tariffs as a tool to promote U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\u201cI knew the costs were going to go up, and these are manufactured in China,\u201d Salaytah said of a probe test light he purchased before Tuesday's tariff went into effect.",
      "In addition to imposing a new tariff on Chinese imports, Trump\u2019s executive order also suspended a little-known trade exemption that allowed goods worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order left open the possibility for the loophole to still be used with shipments from other countries.",
      "The trade rule, known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d has existed for nearly a century. It came under greater scrutiny in recent years due to the rapidly growing number of low-cost items coming into the U.S. from China, mainly from prominent China-founded online retailers such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress.",
      "Former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed a crackdown on the loophole in September, but the rules did not take effect before Biden left office.",
      "Shein and Temu have gained global popularity by offering a quickly updated assortment of ultra-inexpensive clothes, accessories, gifts and gadgets shipped mostly from China, allowing the two e-commerce companies to compete on the home turf of American companies.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon is trying to compete with them through an online storefront that mimics their business model by offering cheap products shipped directly from China.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear. Under de minimis, Shein, Temu and AliExpress could bypass taxes collected by customs authorities. But under the changes effective Tuesday, company shipments from China will now be subject to existing duties plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Trump, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these orders are valued less than $800, which means all or virtually all of them are going to get caught in that,\u201d Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Financial, said.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, said he thinks the price increases on platforms like Shein and Temu will be \u201cpretty small\u201d and the products they sell will remain cheap. However, the rule change is likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Kaziukenas said.",
      "The new tariffs will also hit third-party sellers on Amazon that import products from China, according to Squali. He expects sellers to eat some of the costs and pass the rest onto customers, which he thinks could result in percentage price increases in the mid-single digits. Other e-commerce sites that host businesses, such as Etsy, are also going to be impacted, Squali said.",
      "Temu, which is owned by China\u2019s PDD Holdings, has previously said its growth did not depend on the de minimis policy. Though most of its products are shipped from China, Temu has been recruiting Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that experts said would allow it to not be as exposed to changes around the trade rule.",
      "In January, China also introduced measures to help cross-border e-commerce build overseas warehousing by offering them tax rebates or tax exemptions",
      "The day after November's U.S. presidential election, Brieane Olson, CEO of teen clothing chain PacSun, went to Hong Kong to meet with factory executives to figure out ways to prepare for Trump\u2019s tariff plan.",
      "Roughly 35% to 40% of PacSun\u2019s garments are made in China, even as the chain has accelerated moves to diversify with suppliers in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "But Olson said Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese goods was less extreme than the company anticipated. For now, PacSun doesn\u2019t plan to increase prices on its products or move its manufacturing of knitwear and denim out of China.",
      "Toys are another category of consumer products that relies heavily on imports from China. Greg Ahearn, the president and CEO of The Toy Association trade group, said he thinks toy companies that source in China are going to absorb the cost of the new tariff in the short term.",
      "Eventually, those price hikes will be moved onto the consumer, Ahearn said.",

Musk had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer said Tuesday.",
      "Musk escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff.",

It also placed two other U.S. firms on an unreliable entity list that could bar them from investing in China.",
      "China and Google have had a long and entangled relationship going back to the early 2000s.",
      "Here's a look at Google's history in China and what the antitrust probe means for the company:",
      "Google launched Chinese-language search engine google.cn in 2006. It was censored to comply with Beijing\u2019s laws, and in 2009, was a major search engine in China with about 36% market share.",
      "In 2010, in response to a cyberattack and an increasing unwillingness to comply with censorship rules, Google said it was no longer willing to block search results and shut down its Chinese search engine, redirecting users to its Hong Kong site instead.",
      "Beijing later blocked Google services under its Great Firewall censorship system, including its email service Gmail, as well as its Chrome browser and search engine, making it inaccessible to users in mainland China.",
      "China typically blocks most Western internet platforms, such as Google, as well as social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Although Google services are not accessible in China, the company still maintains a presence in the country, primarily focused on sales and engineering for its advertising business. It also has employees working on services including Google Cloud and customer solutions.",
      "Google maintains offices in the major Chinese cities Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.",
      "China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it was investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws.",

      "But the AI-generated overviews that Google has been increasingly displaying in at the top of its search results appeared to be helping to bring in more advertising. Google's ad sales climbed 11% from the previous year to $72.5 billion to exceed analyst estimates.",
      "\u201cThe early signs suggest that AI is working for Google,\u201d said Jim Yu, CEO of BrightEdge, which helps websites rank higher in search results. \"What it does for Google is keep more of the digital experience happening within its search engine. And by the time they send someone to another site, shoppers and readers have already gotten further down their journey. So that visitor is worth a lot more to an advertiser.\u201d",
      "But Google also has spending billions of dollars on its AI expansion, a huge investment that some investors are questioning after t he Chinese startup DeepSeek found an effective way to deploy similar technology at a fraction of the cost. Alphabet is expecting its ongoing AI expansion to increase its capital from about $60 billion last year to $75 billion this year.",
      "Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sought to reassure investors all that spending will pay off during a Tuesday conference call by emphasizing the way AI is helping to boost Google's fortunes by attracting more search traffic and making other services more popular.",
      "\u201cThe company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing and launching products faster than ever before,\u201d Pichai said.",
      "Before the fourth-quarter results came out, Google made a change that in its AI principles signaling it may be more open to selling the technology in areas that it had previously indicated it would avoid. The revised principles removed previous commitments not to deploy AI in weaponry or surveillance that had been in place since 2018. Pichai didn't address the change during Tuesday's conference call and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The uncertainty over AI isn't the only worry hanging over Google.",
      "The Mountain View, California, company also is facing a regulatory crackdown in the U.S., by far its most lucrative market, raising the specter that its revenue could be undercut.",
      "After weighing the evidence presented during a high-profile trial, a federal judge last year declared Google\u2019s search engine is an illegal monopoly \u2014 a decision that has opened the door for regulators to propose forcing the company to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Court hearings on how Google should be punished for its abuses in the search market are scheduled to begin in April, with a decision anticipated before autumn.",
      "Besides the legal assault on its search engine, Google also has been ordered  to tear down the barriers protecting its Play Store  for Android smartphone apps. That ruling is currently on hold while Google appeals. Google is also awaiting a ruling in antitrust trial in Virginia revolving around the technology underlying its digital ad network.",

      "Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury\u2019s verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbeha...",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury's verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbehavior. Video game maker Epic Games, which brought the case alleging Google's Play Store has been abusing its stranglehold over the Android app market, countered with arguments outlining why both the verdict and punishment should be affirmed to foster more innovation and lower prices.",
      "In a nearly hour-long presentation in San Francisco's Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Google lawyer Jessica Ellsworth explained why the company believes the judge overseeing a month-long trial in 2023 improperly allowed the market in its case to be defined differently than it had in a similar antitrust trial revolving around Apple's antitrust trial in 2021.",
      "Ellsworth also asserted the trial shouldn't have been decided by a jury in the first place because Google exercised its consent to that process and demanded the case be decided by a judge instead, as had the trial by Apple.",
      "Epic, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed separate antitrust cases against Apple and Google on the same day in August 2020 and culminated in dramatically different outcomes. Unlike the jury in Google's trial in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers largely sided with Apple in an 185-decision that defined the Play Store and Apple's iPhone app store as part of a broader competitive market.",
      "Ellsworth told the appeals court that U.S. District Judge James Donato improperly allowed Epic to turn the Google trial into a \u201cdo-over\u201d that excluded the Apple app store as a rival in the market definition that led to the jury's verdict in its case.",
      "\"You can't just lose an issue that was fully litigated the first time (in the Apple case) and then pretend it didn't happen,\" Ellsworth said. She said the competition that Google and Apple engage in while making the two operating systems that power virtually all of the world's smartphones \u201csufficiently disciplines\u201d their actions in the app market.",
      "But the appeals judges indicated they believed the market definitions could differ in the separate app store cases because Apple bundles all its software and the iPhone together \u2014 creating what has become known as a \u201cwalled garden\u201d \u2014 while Google licenses the Android software that includes its Play Store a wide variety of smartphone makers.",
      "\u201cThere are clearly some factual differences between the Android world and Apple world,\u201d Judge Danielle J. Forrest told Ellsworth.",
      "Judge Gabriel Sanchez also sounded skeptical about Google's claims about being lumped with an improper market definition in its trial.",
      "\u201cEven if Google vigorously competes with Apple (in smartphone operating systems), that doesn't mean it can't create a different ecosystem where it's a monopolist,\u201d Sanchez interjected during Ellsworth's presentation.",
      "Epic attorney Gary Bornstein painted Google's arguments as a desperate and unfounded effort to preserve the system that boosts Google's profits with price-gouging commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app purchases flowing from software downloaded through the Play Store.",
      "The penalties that Donato imposed in October and subsequently postponed while Google pursues its appeal would impose a series of sweeping changes that include making the Play Store's entire library of 2 million apps available to potential competitors \u2014 a move expected to result in lower commission rates.",
      "The appeals court hasn't set a timeline for issuing a ruling in the Play Store case, but it typically takes several months before a decision is reached.",
      "Google is also currently facing other potential penalties that could include being forced to sell its Chrome web browser after a judge in another antitrust trial ruled its ubiquitous search engine is an illegal monopoly, too.",
      "In Monday's two-hour hearing Bornstein contended that Google never tried to define the Android app market during the trial the way it presented it during its appeal and reminded the three-judge panel that the bar should be set high before reversing a jury's verdict and the ensuing punishment ordered by a lower court judge.",
      "\u201cThe benefit of the doubt does not go to the wrongdoer,\u201d Bornstein said.",
      "The judges seemed more troubled by Donato's decision to stick with a jury trial after the case changed shortly before the Epic trial when Google settled lawsuits brought by attorneys general across the U.S. and another prominent app developer, Match Group. An agreement for a jury trial had been reached when the attorneys general and Match cases were going to be combined with Epic's, but Google wanted to revert to having a judge decide the outcome after settling some of the claims only to be rebuffed by Donato.",
      "At one point during Bornstein's presentation, Forrest openly mused about the possibility of declaring the verdict as a decision rendered by the equivalent of an advisory jury and sending the case back to Donato for a more lengthy ruling.",
      "That is an approach favored by Ellsworth, who pointed out that the judge's ruling in the Apple app store case spanned nearly 200 pages while the jury in the Google trial \u201cwere asked eight questions and they offered 14 words defining a relevant market.\u201d",
      "But Bornstein urged the appeals court to resort to giving Donato a \u201chomework assignment\u201d that would give Google more time to profit from its illegal conduct.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- A magnitude-7.6 earthquake shook the Caribbean Sea southwest of the Cayman Islands Saturday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and some islands and countries urged people near the coastline to move inland in case of a tsunami.",
      "The quake struck at 6:23 p.m. local time in the middle of the sea and had a depth of 10 kilometers, the USGS said. Its epicenter was located 130 miles (209 kilometers) south-southwest of George Town in the Cayman Islands.",
      "The U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said there is no tsunami alert for the U.S. mainland but issued a tsunami advisory for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which was later cancelled.",

    "summary": "In an interview on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday, Democratic  Sen. Chris Murphy warned of an \"assault on the Constitution\" under President Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "\"That is the evisceration of democracy,\" Murphy told ABC's \"This Week.\"",
      "In an interview on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy warned of an \"assault on the Constitution\" under President Donald Trump.",
      "\"I think this is the most serious constitutional crisis the country has faced, certainly since Watergate,\" Murphy said. \"The president is attempting to seize control of power, and for corrupt purposes.\"",
      "Pointing to the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the federal government, including by freezing foreign aid programs under the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Murphy said the country is in the midst of a \"red-alert moment\" and argued that Trump is ushering in \"the billionaire takeover of government.\"",
      "Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire leader of the new Department of Government Efficiency, have called for a shuttering of USAID, with Trump posting on social media, \"CLOSE IT DOWN!\"",
      "\"The president wants to be able to decide how and where money is spent so that he can reward his political friends, he can punish his political enemies,\" Murphy said. \"That is the evisceration of democracy.\"",
      "\"You stand that next to the wholesale endorsement of political violence with the pardons given to every single Jan. 6 rioter -- including the most violent, who beat police officers over the head with baseball bats -- and you can see what he's trying to do here,\" Murphy continued. \"He is trying to crush his opposition by making them afraid of losing federal funding, by making them afraid of physical violence.\"",
      "Murphy accused Musk of being motivated to shutter USAID in order to promote his own business interests.",
      "\"It makes America much less safe around the world, but it helps China. USAID is a thorn in the side of the Chinese government,\" Murphy said. \"Elon Musk has many major business interests at stake inside Beijing, and so making Beijing happy is going to accrue to the financial benefit of Elon Musk and many billionaires who outsource work to China.\"",
      "Murphy said it amounted to an \"assault on the Constitution in order to serve the billionaire class\" that will require \"full scale opposition.\"",
      "\"You can't just rely on the courts,\" he said. \"Ultimately, you've got to bring the American public into this conversation, because we need our Republican colleagues in the House and in the Senate, ultimately, to put a stop to this. You cannot just rely on the court system when the challenge to the Constitution and the billionaire takeover is so acute and so urgent.\"",
      "Murphy also pushed back against Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman, who said on the Puck podcast \"Somebody's Gotta Win\" last week that Democrats need to tone down their rhetoric, saying Americans are \"not going to pay attention\" if Democrats \"keep yelling\" and using \"the most severe kinds of language.\"",
      "\"I don't agree. I'm not going to calm down,\" Murphy said. \"This is a fundamental corruption, and democracies don't last forever, and what those who are trying to destroy democracies want is for everyone to stay quiet, for everyone to believe that the moment isn't urgent.\"",

      "In addition to the humanitarian work that has halted, scores of career USAID workers living abroad are also seeing their lives turned upside down. Several officials were very emotional describing their current situations and uncertainty.",
      "All USAID humanitarian work around the world has effectively stopped, these current and former officials said, despite the State Department saying there are waivers for lifesaving programs.",
      "\"Right now, there is no USAID humanitarian assistance happening,\" a current USAID official in the humanitarian division said. \"There are waivers put in place by Secretary Rubio for emergency food assistance and a number of other sectors, but they are a fraud and a sham and intended to give the illusion of continuity, which is untrue.\"",

      "But the above USAID official pushed back, saying those sectors are \"actually unable to access their lines of credit here in Washington, D.C., for money already obligated to, already contractually put forward by the U.S. government.\"",
      "\"And this is meaning [a] lack of provision of assistance,\" the official continued. \"This is meaning staff layoffs, meaning absolute confusion and mayhem. Some may have some money to keep going for a little bit, but not for long.\"",
      "Another former official who spoke with numerous USAID humanitarian partner organizations said, \"Not one has received any funding since the stop-work order to continue work, even if theoretically that work is allowed to continue.\"",

We have a nursery painted with a crib ready for our baby that has taken us three years of fertility treatments to conceive,\" the official based in Asia said, her voice cracking with emotion. \"Instead of nesting and planning for their arrival, we are unsure if Secretary Rubio and President Trump are going to abandon us overseas or abandon us when we land on American soil. We have been told there is no money to assist USAID families that are awaiting the arrival of our infants with resettlement in the U.S.\"",
      "\"We have been using refugee resources from our churches and community groups that we usually use to help refugees from places like Syria and Afghanistan,\" the official added. \"We are using these resources to figure out how to land as close to on our feet as possible. Unless the tide of public opinion shifts, each of these families are going to arrive homeless, jobless and insurance-less within a matter of days, or possibly even hours, of stepping foot on American soil.\"",

      "\"We worked across administrations with programs changing, growing, shrinking, and it's a circumstance right now where we literally have focused our life on this USAID mission, and we do not have a home to go back to, which is quite typical of Foreign Service families, and we don't know how we're supposed to pick up and just leave,\" the official added.",
      "\"How do you leave when you have not just family, not just school-age kids -- you have pets, you have things, you don't have a home to go back to, and you have a mission that you believe in and that you've supported for decades?\" the official said. \"And it's just the rug pulled under you.\"",

      "Several lawsuits against the Trump administration are coming down the pipeline.",
      "Environmental nonprofits are gearing up to challenge some of the actions President Donald Trump has issued since taking office.",
      "There is litigation coming for the majority of the executive orders Trump has signed so far that affect the environment, conservation and decarbonizing the economy, several nonprofits told ABC News.",
      "Environmental lawyers are also on standby for any directives issued in the future that could violate existing environmental laws, according to several sources familiar with the lawsuits already being prepared against the Trump administration.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "Trump began his second term as president by signing a slew of executive actions, including an order that attempts to revoke action taken by President Joe Biden in the last weeks of his term to ban all future offshore oil and natural gas drilling on America's East and West coasts, the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and Alaska's North Bering Sea.",
      "While Trump immediately vowed to reverse the ban when it was signed on Jan. 6, that could prove difficult. The law Biden invoked, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, was written so a presidential action under its authority is permanent -- providing legal precedent to ensure it stands, several environmental lawyers told ABC News, describing Trump's move as illegal.",
      "\"We'll see them in court at some point,\" said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \"I think we will prevail on this.\"",
      "Trump's vow to revoke the ban is an attempt to fulfill his campaign promise to increase fossil fuel production, Sam Sankar, senior vice president at Earthjustice, the nation's largest public interest environmental law firm, told ABC News.",
      "In doing so, he is ignoring a large swath of U.S. coastline communities who would prefer for drilling to decrease, said Joanne Spalding, director of the environmental law program at the Sierra Club.",
      "\"People in Florida don't want drilling. People in California don't want drilling,\" Spalding told ABC News. \"There's lots of places where people are not interested in having that activity on their coastlines.\"",
      "Existing environmental laws could also serve as roadblocks as Trump aims to increase the amount of federal land that will be subject to drilling, the experts said.",
      "Separately, groups criticized Trump's planned 10-to-1 deregulatory freeze, which would require the federal government to repeal 10 existing rules, regulations or guidance documents in order to adopt a new one, as \"completely arbitrary,\" Spalding said.",
      "That order is \"almost verbatim\" to a two-for-one deregulatory freeze issued in 2017 that \"never amounted to anything,\" Hartl said.",
      "\"A lot of what we've seen, even in the first two weeks, have been almost just copy-and-paste activities from executive orders that we saw in the first Trump administration,\" he said.",
      "The potential dismantling of several federal agencies that conduct important work for conservation is a concern for environmental groups.",
      "The Office of Management and Budget Office's move to suspend federal financial aid programs could be a warning sign for federal agencies that conduct environmental work that does not align with Trump's agenda, Hartl said.",
      "\"Right now, the biggest threat to the environment is Trump's across-the-board attempt to simply dismantle the federal government,\" he said.",
      "In addition, the presence of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and DOGE head Elon Musk's buyout offer to millions of federal employees could severely disrupt the conservation work of several agencies, he added.",
      "\"If you don't have people working at the EPA, it's pretty hard to keep the air clean, the water clean,\" Hartl said. \"If you don't have folks working at the National Park Service, how are you going to run your national parks? How are you going to protect endangered wildlife?\"",
      "In addition, the potential defunding of the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Act -- both by enacted by Biden -- poses serious setbacks for decarbonizing the country's economy and moving toward a net-zero economy by 2050, environmental advocates said. Both are \"the most important pieces of legislation ever in addressing global climate change,\" Spalding said.",
      "As part of his executive actions, Trump temporarily suspended the disbursement of funds from the IRA. Sankar said that has worried NGOs because the money is intended to advance the development of a clean energy economy as well as improve public health and support communities that bore the brunt of the impact of the fossil fuel economy.",
      "\"We are looking at and developing lawsuits aimed at ensuring that the money flows to the intended recipients,\" he said.",
      "Several lawsuits challenging the authority of DOGE are also being prepared, according to the groups.",
      "Many of Trump's declarations are relatively symbolic or declare an intention but don't necessarily constitute any actual action, environmental law experts said.",
      "\"Trump likes just holding up his signature, and that's the main reason we we see him doing these flurry of executive orders,\" Hartl said, adding that a lot of Trump's actions were not effective during the first term.",
      "Along with the executive orders comes rumor and speculation about what they actually can achieve, which makes it difficult for nonprofits to take immediate action, Sankar said.",
      "Because of this, environmental groups may be more selective this time around about which executive actions they actually decide to take to court -- especially since nonprofits don't have endless resources to challenge every order, Spalding said.",
      "\"We're always very choosy about our litigation to make sure that we have the best claims with the clients who are most clearly affected,\" Sankar said.",
      "This time around, environmental lawyers will be more savvy about responses, Spalding said.",
      "\"We'll continue to focus on those priorities and make sure that we're engaged every step of the way during the regulatory rollback process,\" she said.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has paused the imposition of tariffs on small-value packages arriving from China",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has paused the imposition of tariffs on small-value packages arriving from China",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has paused imposing tariffs on small-value packages arriving from China, apparently to give federal agencies time to sort out how to process millions of such shipments that have come through the U.S. border every day without paying taxes.",
      "The executive order, dated Wednesday, didn't say when the pause would end but said it would cease when the Department of Commerce could put in place \u201cadequate systems\u201d to \u201cfully and expediently process and collect tariff revenue.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's just showing we're moving fast, and the implications are not fully understood when some of these regulations are put in place,\u201d said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at the supply chain platform e2open, pointing out that Trump's order affected huge numbers of small packages, many in transit.",
      "\u201cThe volumes are absolutely incredible,\u201d Lash said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, they go from not requiring filing (for tariffs) ... to actually requiring full filing, which is a complicated task.\u201d",
      "Ending tariff exemptions on low-cost packages from China has broad bipartisan support in Washington, and Trump pulled the plug when he raised tariffs on Chinese goods by 10% earlier this week. Goods sent through duty-free packages became subject not only to existing tariffs \u2014 25% for many Chinese products \u2014 but also the new 10%.",
      "It marks another pause on Trump\u2019s policies weeks into his second administration, including orders to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada that were suspended after the two allies took steps to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking.",
      "The U.S. Postal Service, which would be burdened with collecting tariffs on small packages, on Tuesday announced it would not accept parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong, only to reverse the decision the next day. It said it would work with Customs and Border Protection to implement a collection process for the new tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt's one of those things where you put in any change so quickly it catches people unprepared,\u201d Lash said.",
      "Introduced in 1938, the so-called de minimis exception was intended to facilitate the flow of small packages valued at no more than $5, the equivalent of about $106 today. The threshold increased to $200 in 1994 and $800 in 2016. But the rapid rise of cross-border e-commerce, driven by China, has challenged the intent of the decades-old customs exception rule.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to a report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. And the U.S. market has been a major destination.",
      "In 2023, for the first time, more than 1 billion such packages came through U.S. customs, up from 134 million in 2015. By the end of last year, Customs and Border Protection said it was processing about 4 million small shipments a day, many of which came from China through online retail platforms such as Shein and Temu.",

      "President Donald Trump is meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in a high-stakes visit for a key ally that depends on the United States for security and trade.",
      "At the top of the agenda is military cooperation to deter threats, foreign investment in the U.S., opportunities to develop technology and American energy exports, according to senior Trump administration officials.",
      "Japan's prime minister will be looking to strike a personal connection with Trump and get reassurance that Trump won't hit Japan with tariffs or abandon its security guarantees. Ishiba faces the challenge of navigating Trump's long-held views that allies take advantage of the U.S. while not paying enough for the cost of American military assistance.",
      "He will likely look to former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was assassinated in 2022 after he left office. Abe used his personal relationship with Trump to push for Japanese interests and avoid a trade war during Trump's first administration.",
      "\"It's a great honor to be with Prime Minister Ishiba of Japan. He's a highly respected man doing a fantastic job,\" Trump said as he met with Ishiba in the Oval Office. \"We have a fantastic relationship. I don't think we'll have any problem whatsoever.\"",
      "The senior administration officials hinted they'll be looking for concessions and commitments from Japan in the form of investments in the U.S.",
      "\"We all know that Trump pays a lot of attention to deficits,\" a senior administration official said. \"We welcome Japanese investments in the United States, including in the U.S. manufacturing sector.\"",
      "\"There will be a lot of discussion about that, as well as exports from the U.S., most likely in the energy sector,\" the official added.",
      "The CEO of SoftBank, one of Japan's largest companies, visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago during the transition period and recently came to the White House, promising to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years, creating 100,000 jobs.",
      "\"The United States is proud of our long and close alliance with Japan, and it's time for a new age of U.S.-Japan relations to bring peace and prosperity to the Indo-Pacific. Our two nations will continue to work together to ensure we deter threats in the region through our full range of military capabilities. Today, you should expect President Trump and Prime Minister Ishiba to discuss realistic training exercises and increase our cooperation on defense equipment and technology,\" the senior administration official said.",
      "\"They will also discuss foreign investment into the United States to create high-quality American jobs. President Trump and the prime minister will also discuss ways to improve our cybersecurity capabilities, increase space cooperation and promote joint business opportunities to develop critical technologies like AI and semiconductors, and lastly, as President Trump aims to unleash American energy exports to the rest of the world,\" the senior administration official added.",
      "One senior official also noted the administration supports efforts to hold trilateral meetings with Japan and South Korea and that there will see continuity there.",
      "When asked about whether Trump will ask Japan to raise its defense spending, an issue that Trump has raised with allies across the globe, the officials declined to \"get ahead\" of discussions.",
      "But one official added, \"There are negotiations that go on constantly, quite frankly, about the status of facilities and weapons and deployments and training areas, and so they're always constantly being adjusted to ensure the strongest possible deployment of the alliance, you know, the capabilities between the two of us and the investment that both countries are making in our shared security.\"",
      "One senior administration official added that the visit will be a chance to \"continue to develop the long-standing friendship and relationship between our two nations.\"",

      "Normal day-to-day work ceased earlier in the week, when the Trump administration announced plans to place all direct-hire employees on leave starting Friday, leaving career officials to focus on the logistical hurdles of recalling thousands of overseas employees back to the U.S., including reserving flights for those officials and their families.",

      "As congressional Democrats scramble to rescue USAID, its thousands of employees in the U.S. and around the globe are grappling with how to \"leave with dignity,\" another career agency official said.",
      "But doing so has proven to be a challenge. A message posted on USAID.gov signaled that some \"designated personnel\" would remain on the job, prompting a frantic race among staff to secure their livelihoods.",
      "\"It's the Hunger Games,\" another career USAID official based in Washington said. \"They're narrowing down lists to the smallest number of staff. People fighting to be on those lists.\"",
      "USAID staff on Thursday were digesting news that all but roughly 600 employees would be placed on leave by the end of the week. President Trump has accused the agency of perpetrating \"tremendous fraud\" and promoting left-wing ideologies.",
      "Meanwhile, officials deployed overseas face hurdles of their own. The abrupt stop-work orders and funding freezes imposed by the Trump administration have placed frontline USAID employees in the uncomfortable position of explaining to regional partners what is happening.",
      "\"Many of [the foreign service nationals] have worked for USAID for 20-30 years,\" said one USAID official stationed in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \"It's impossible to explain to them what is going on. It breaks their faith in America. We are going to lose thousands of our best friends and allies.\"",
      "In a different African country, staff met earlier in the week to begin choreographing their departure, a local USAID official recalled.",
      "\"The meeting today with local staff was rough,\" the official said. \"The ambassador was there, and folks were crying. It was extremely sad. Both the mission director and the deputy mission director were also in tears.\"",

We have school-age children with typical challenges you would face in the U.S. -- but not with the resources you would have in the U.S. -- that we've had to manage, and we've been willing to move wherever is best for the agency,\" the official said. \"We do not have a home to go back to, which is quite typical of Foreign Service families, and we don't know how we're supposed to pick up and just leave.\"",
      "A USAID official based in Asia told ABC News that she's pregnant and is worried that the administration is going to abandon her overseas.",
      "\"I am among more than a dozen American families that are either on or planning obstetric medevac to deliver our babies,\" she said. \"We have been told there is no money to assist USAID families that are awaiting the arrival of our infants with resettlement in the U.S. We have been using refugee resources from our churches and community groups that we usually use to help refugees from places like Syria and Afghanistan.\"",
      "\"Unless the tide of public opinion shifts,\" the official said, \"each of these families are going to arrive homeless, jobless, and insurance-less within a matter of days, or possibly even hours, of stepping foot on American soil.\"",

      "Despite verbal assurances from Secretary of State Marco Rubio about allowing lifesaving humanitarian aid to continue, international aid and development work funded by the U.S. government have almost entirely come to a halt, multiple leaders in humanitarian aid confirmed to ABC News.",
      "Many organizations say they are now worried food from U.S. farmers that had been designated for some of the poorest countries and programs to help malnourished children in conflict zones is at risk of perishing.",
      "One humanitarian aid leader, who asked that ABC News not use their name as many organizations are worried about retribution from the Trump administration, described sitting on over 1,000 tons of food in Mozambique that needs to be distributed. \"It's utterly, utterly wasteful,\" the leader said on the phone.",
      "The problem is threefold. The State Department last week promised \"waivers\" that would allow some aid programs focused on lifesaving help, including food, water and nutrition, to continue despite widespread stop-work orders issued by the Trump administration.",
      "But organizations have been told they must wait for the State Department or U.S. Agency for International Development to inform them that their specific programs have been approved under these waivers and given the green light to go forward. While some organizations have received limited waivers for some of their programs in certain countries, others have not.",
      "Plus, thousands of USAID staff members  have been told to return home from posts abroad, and hundreds more in Washington, D.C., could be put on administrative leave. Partnering organizations and international nongovernmental organizations say their emails and questions are going unanswered. On top of all of the confusion, there is the lack of actual cash to pay for programs.",
      "When asked about the urgent warnings from humanitarian aid partners that the waiver system was not working, Secretary of State Marco Rubio doubled down and questioned the organizations' competence.",
      "\"If it saves lives, if it's emergency lifesaving aid -- food, medicine, whatever -- they have a waiver. I don't know how much clearer we can be. And if they're not applying it, then maybe they're not a very good organization and maybe they shouldn't be getting money at all,\" Rubio told reporters last Tuesday.",
      "But various USAID officials and humanitarian aid leaders insisted to ABC News that despite Rubio's public statements, waivers were not working.",
      "\"Right now, there is no USAID humanitarian assistance happening. There are waivers put in place by Secretary Rubio for emergency food assistance and a number of other sectors, but they are a fraud and a sham and intended to give the illusion of continuity, which is untrue,\" a USAID official in the humanitarian division said on a call with reporters on Friday.",
      "\"There is no staff left anymore to actually process waiver requests or to move money or to make awards or to do anything,\" the official added. \"We've ceased to exist, and any assertions to the contrary, by anyone, are untrue.\"",
      "One executive for a humanitarian aid organization described conversation with lawmakers who were, they said, in disbelief to hear that organizations who are trying to continue lifesaving work delivering food and water were still locked out the federal payment system and unable to access cash. \"Surely, there is cash?' I had to say, 'No, no, there is no cash.'\" the humanitarian aid leader told ABC News. \"We are having to first get through that disbelief that this would actually be happening in this way.\"",
      "Organizations across the globe have described being locked out of federal payment systems or unable to draw down funds, even for services already rendered. Many have not been able to access funds since December.",
      "One leader in humanitarian aid described a conversation with lawmakers, saying they said, \"Surely, there is cash.\"",
      "\"I had to say, 'No, no, there is no cash.' We are having to first get through that disbelief that this would actually be happening in this way,\" the humanitarian aid leader told ABC News. Other leaders, too, have described talking to allies on Capitol Hill who were shocked to learn that the cash had been cut off.",
      "The impacts of the global freeze on American aid are widespread. While the U.S. spends around 1% of its federal budget on foreign aid, it is still the largest contributor of humanitarian aid worldwide.",
      "Gena Perry, executive director of the American Soybean Association's World Initiative for Soy in Human Health, told ABC News there is about 60,000 metric tons of soy product worth $23 million for the Department of Agriculture's Food for Progress program that \"can't be delivered right now,\" following the stop-work orders.",
      "As of Friday, the foremost U.S. emergency food aid program, Food for Peace, remained subject to stop-work orders. As a result, aid agencies estimate over 500 million metric tons of U.S. food commodities, from American farmers and manufacturers, are stuck in various locations and not being distributed.",
      "According to the World Food Program, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, there are an estimated 4.5 million children facing acute malnutrition. Humanitarian aid partners estimated more than 70 sites for testing and treating tens of thousands of malnourished children are being shuttered, as well as 92 health facilities.",
      "Amid the conflict in Sudan, an estimated 48 health facilities serving hundreds of thousands of people are now closed, according to multiple aid organizations.",
      "Many nonprofit and aid organizations have worried about going on the record and talking to reporters about the impacts of the freeze, out of fear they will be singled out and face retribution. While some of the largest organizations are frantically working to move money around to keep their operations afloat, others are already facing real financial consequences and are at risk of shutting down immediately.",
      "\"We're in the midst of a global refugee crisis affecting more than 120 million people all over the world. \u2026 These stop-work orders and this foreign aid freeze puts a stop to all that people who were, a week ago, getting assistance, getting food, getting healthcare, getting treatment for their trauma,\" Noah Gottschalk, senior director of international advocacy at HIAS, a global Jewish refugee and immigrant aid organization, told ABC News. \"So, it's an incredible slap to the face for some of the world's most vulnerable people, people who have already experienced so much suffering.\"",
      "Gottschalk said his organization alone has had to stop programs for survivors of sexual violence in Latin America and stop healthcare support to children across Africa. The organization is unsure which of its programs will be given the green light to go forward. He described how partners and colleagues are waiting to hear if work distributing vaccines and vouchers for food or running schools, for example, will be deemed \"lifesaving.\"",
      "Beyond humanitarian concerns, aid organizations and diplomats are worried about national security risks because of the sudden freeze.",
      "\"The U.S. is abandoning some of the most desperate people in the world right now, and it absolutely will create a vacuum. And I'm deeply concerned about who is going to fill that vacuum, whether it's armed groups, whether it's cartels, human traffickers,\" Gottschalk added.",
      "Work done by the U.S. military in Syria to secure camps holding thousands of Islamic State fighters has been frozen during the chaotic funding freezes. Nonprofit organizations have reported security guards walking off the job at some of these ISIS camps after the initial stop-work orders.",
      "\"We see it in Syria and Sudan -- already places completely disrupted by conflict, internal conflict where communities were relying on emergency food aid, cash assistance to buy food in order to keep people alive. It will result in higher risk of conflict. There's no doubt about it,\" one international nonprofit leader told ABC News.",
      "Other experts in international development have warned the funding freeze could make the crisis at the U.S. southern border worse. Aid organizations told ABC News that funding for \"narcotics interdiction\" in Colombia was paused, which had totaled over $380 million annually. There is a real risk that cartels can fill the vacuum and worsen the mass migration in the region.",
      "The White House and State Department have insisted they are successfully rooting out waste. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News this week, \"President Trump's main goal since Day One: ensuring that every penny that goes out from Washington, D.C., aligns with his 'America First' principles, and that's certainly true when it comes to foreign aid. The American taxpayers have been funding just useless priorities overseas.\"",
      "While it is common practice for incoming administrations to restructure and reprioritize aid, the Trump administration has instead effectively embarked on a wholescale shuttering of programs, many of which had long enjoyed bipartisan support.",
      "\"An incoming administration will always, you know, reassess activities and essentially map out a vision and a strategy around how it wants to use development as a soft-power tool,\" one executive with a humanitarian aid organization told ABC News. \"I think what you're seeing now is blatant lies about how stuff is being used, and secondly, the disruptive way they are burning down the house in this fashion will actually lead to really negative, perhaps unintended but certainly avoidable, negative consequences.\""

      "A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from orchestrating its plan to place 2,200 employees of the United States Agency for International Development on leave at midnight.",
      "In an order late Friday, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols -- a Trump appointee -- issued a temporary restraining order that prevents Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency from placing the employees on administrative leave as had been planned. The judge also ordered the reinstatement of some 500 USAID workers who had already been put on administrative leave and ordered that no USAID employees should be evacuated from their host countries before Feb. 14 at 11:59 p.m.",
      "The judge's order came several hours after a hearing Friday afternoon during which Nichols said he would issue the temporary restraining order.",
      "Two foreign service unions had sued the federal government amid the Trump administration's attempts to reduce USAID's workforce from 14,000 to only 300 employees as part of its efforts to slash government spending.",
      "Earlier Nichols had said the order would prevent the \"accelerated removal\" of USAID employees from their posts overseas.",
      "\"This is about how employees are harmed in their capacity as employees -- in the employee/employer relationship -- and it seems to me that, for reasons I will discuss in this order, that I will enter there, the plaintiffs have established at least that there is irreparable harm as it relates to that relationship,\" Nichols said at the hearing.",
      "Lawyers from the Department of Justice acknowledged that 500 employees from USAID have already been placed on leave, with 2,000 more set to go on leave at midnight.",
      "Acting assistant attorney Brett Shumate told the judge the layoffs were necessary because \"the president has decided there was corruption and fraud at USAID.\"",
      "\"He doesn't have to justify to the plaintiffs and the court how he exercises his foreign affairs,\" Shumate argued. \"The president has determined, in his view, significant serious action needs to be taken tonight to prevent taxpayer funds from being sent outside the United States, used for purposes that he doesn't think are appropriate.\"",
      "The American Foreign Service Organization and the American Federation of Government Employees filed the lawsuit in D.C. federal court Thursday, alleging that Trump engaged in a series of \"unconstitutional and illegal actions\" to systematically destroy USAID.",
      "\"Children are being pulled out of school during the middle of the school year at developmentally fragile time periods,\" plaintiffs' attorneys told the judge Friday. \"People are being cut off from their access to health care without being able to make arrangements for new health care providers when they have serious health conditions. People are being asked to go back to the United States where they may not have housing they don't have a home to come back to, and they're being asked to do that with no source of income or in prospects.\"",
      "These actions have generated a global humanitarian crisis by abruptly halting the crucial work of USAID employees, grantees, and contractors. They have cost thousands of American jobs. And they have imperiled U.S. national security interests,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "The plaintiffs said Trump has unilaterally attempted to reduce the agency without congressional authorization, arguing that Congress is the only entity with the authority to dismantle USAID.",
      "The lawsuit reads like a timeline of the last two weeks, laying out each step that formed the groundwork to break USAID, beginning with Trump's first day in office. Shortly after Trump froze foreign aid via an executive order on his first day, he began to target USAID by ordering his State Department to begin issuing stop work orders, the lawsuit said.",
      "\"USAID grantees and contractors reeled as they were -- without any notice or process -- constrained from carrying out their work alleviating poverty, disease, and humanitarian crises,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "Next came the layoffs, the lawsuit alleges, with thousands of contractors and employees of USAID losing their jobs, leading medical clinics, soup kitchens, and refugee assistance programs across the world to be brought \"to an immediate halt.\"",
      "\"The humanitarian consequences of defendants' actions have already been catastrophic,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges the Department of Government Efficiency and Elon Musk -- who boasted about \"feeding USAID into the woodchipper\" -- made the final move to gut the agency, locking thousands of employees out of their computers and accessing classified material improperly.",
      "While each step to dismantle the organization differed, the lawsuit alleged that they were unified by one thing: \"Not a single one of defendants' actions to dismantle USAID were taken pursuant to congressional authorization.\"",
      "The plaintiffs have asked the court to declare Trump's actions unlawful and issue an order requiring the Trump administration to \"cease actions to shut down USAID's operations in a manner not authorized by Congress.\"",

But as President Donald Trump cracks down on illegal immigration, Hamilton County deputies soon could become the first in Indiana empowered to carry out federal immigration duties and one of many nationally that Trump's administration hopes to enlist.",
      "\u201cWe definitely are joining,\u201d Chief Deputy John Lowes told The Associated Press. \u201cWe want to collaborate with ICE to make sure we keep our community safe.\u201d",
      "Under Trump, U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement is reviving and expanding a decades-old program that trains local law officers to interrogate immigrants in their custody and detain them for potential deportation. The 287(g) program \u2014 named for a section of the 1996 law that created it \u2014 currently applies only to those already jailed or imprisoned on charges.",
      "But Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, recently told sheriffs that he wants to expand it to include local task forces that can make arrests on the streets, reviving a model that former President Barrack Obama discontinued amid concerns about racial profiling. It's unclear whether that could allow local officers to stop people solely to check their immigration status.",
      "On Friday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced that the Florida Highway Patrol had struck an agreement with ICE to interrogate, arrest and detain immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally and deliver them to federal authorities.",
      "The arrangement will help \u201cfulfill the president\u2019s mission to effectuate the largest deportation program in American history,\u201d DeSantis said.",
      "Advocates for immigrants, meanwhile, are raising alarm about new pacts that put local law officers on immigration enforcement.",
      "\u201cAll of these agreements, in practice, have the same track record of racial profiling, of sweeping in U.S. citizens or people who have lawful status, of having a chilling effect in terms of communities reporting crime to local law enforcement agencies,\" said Nayna Gupta, policy director at the nonprofit American Immigration Council.",
      "In the early 2000s, many of the initial participants in the 287(g) program had agreements that allowed them to enforce immigration laws in their communities, not just their jails. But problems arose in several places, including Arizona.",
      "In 2011, a civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice found that deputies in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, had engaged in a pattern of racial profiling, unlawful stops and arrests of Latinos. The Department of Homeland Security ended its agreement with the county.",
      "The program became \u201cthe hallmark of far-right, anti-immigrant sheriffs\u201d as a means \"to feed people on the basis of their ethnicity into the deportation machine,\u201d asserted Lena Graber, senior staff attorney at the nonprofit Immigrant Legal Resource Center.",
      "In recent years, ICE has offered two types of 287(g) agreements to law enforcement agencies. One model requires four weeks of training and allows local officers to question suspected noncitizens who are jailed on other charges and detain them for ICE. The other model, which Trump launched during his first term, requires just eight hours of training and only allows local officers to serve federal immigration warrants.",
      "As of December, ICE had 135 agreements with sheriff's offices, police departments and prison systems in 21 states, with requests pending from 35 others. Two-thirds of the agreements were in just three states \u2014 Florida, Texas and North Carolina. But no agreements had been signed during Biden\u2019s four years as president, according to ICE data.",
      "On his first day back in office, Trump ordered the Department of Homeland Security to maximize 287(g) agreements for local law officers to investigate, apprehend and detain immigrants. At a recent National Sheriffs\u2019 Association conference, Homan said the administration is looking to lighten detention facility regulations and shorten the training to encourage greater collaboration with federal immigration officials.",
      "The association's president, Kieran Donahue, applauded the announcement.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be local sheriffs\u2019 offices throughout the country, no question, they\u2019re going to sign onto this program,\" Donahue told the AP.",
      "But Donahue is not planning to sign up his own department in Canyon County, Idaho.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of manpower,\u201d he said, adding: \"I have no bed space in my facility. Zero.\u201d",
      "The Florida Department of Law Enforcement in 2002 was the first to sign a 287(g) agreement with the federal government, running a task force for immigration enforcement. Twenty years later, Florida became the first state to require all local agencies with county jails to join the program or inform the state why they couldn't.",
      "After a Venezuelan man who was illegally in the U.S. killed University of Georgia student Laken Riley, Georgia passed a law last year requiring local law enforcement agencies to apply for the program.",
      "This year, Republican lawmakers in about a dozen states are seeking to require or incentivize cooperative agreements with ICE. One measure is sponsored by Texas state Rep. David Spiller, a Republican who also authored a law allowing any law enforcement officer to arrest migrants suspected of entering the country illegally. That law is on hold amid a legal challenge.",
      "Spiller said mandatory participation in ICE programs is essential.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and border czar Homan cannot remove and deport all the people that are a public safety threat to our state and our nation over the next year and a half without the help of our local law enforcement,\" Spiller said.",
      "Already this year, Florida lawmakers have passed legislation that would allot millions of dollars for local immigration enforcement efforts. Legislation passed in Tennessee would direct the state to apply for the 287(g) program and authorize grants for local agencies that join.",
      "Legislation creating a state grant program for 287(g) participants also passed the Indiana Senate this week and is pending in the House. Democratic state Sen. Rodney Pol called it a \u201cvery, very dangerous\u201d and \u201cvery, very disturbing\u201d proposal.",
      "\"We\u2019re putting too much on people, particularly police officers, that are going to be put into situations where they\u2019re going to have to break up their communities,\u201d Pol said.",
      "But Lowes said Hamilton County deputies plan to focus only on people who are already in jail. Last year, he said, the jail booked over 500 people believed to be noncitizens on charges that included driving while intoxicated, drug possession, theft, burglary, sexual battery and other offenses. It's unclear how many were in the country illegally, but ICE became involved in 64 of those cases, he said.",
      "\u201cWe believe that this program will help us see a reduction in some of those crimes and will help us get some of the people out of our community that are committing crimes that endanger our safety,\u201d Lowes said."

      "President Donald Trump says he is firing members of the board of trustees for the Kennedy Center and naming himself chairman",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Friday that he is firing members of the board of trustees for the Kennedy Center and naming himself chairman.",
      "He also indicated that he would be dictating programming at one of the nation's premier cultural institutions, specifically declaring that he'd put an end to events featuring performers in drag.",
      "Trump's announcement came as the new president has bulldozed his way across official Washington during the first weeks of his second term, trying to shutter federal agencies, freeze spending and ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the government.",
      "\u201cAt my direction, we are going to make the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., GREAT AGAIN. I have decided to immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media website.",
      "\u201cWe will soon announce a new Board, with an amazing Chairman, DONALD J. TRUMP!\u201d",
      "In a statement late Friday on its website, the Kennedy Center said it was aware of Trump's post. \u201cWe have received no official communications from the White House regarding changes to our board of trustees,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are aware that some members of our board have received termination notices from the administration.\u201d",
      "The statement continued: \u201cPer the Center\u2019s governance established by Congress in 1958, the chair of the board of trustees is appointed by the Center\u2019s board members. There is nothing in the Center\u2019s statute that would prevent a new administration from replacing board members; however, this would be the first time such action has been taken with the Kennedy Center\u2019s board.\u201d",
      "Unlike former President Joe Biden and other commanders in chief through the decades, Trump did not attend the annual Kennedy Center Honors ceremonies during his first term, held at the performing arts venue in Washington\u2019s Foggy Bottom neighborhood that opened in 1971.",
      "Shortly after Trump\u2019s post, the Kennedy Center website began experiencing technical difficulties. Visitors got a message reading \u201cWe are experiencing high traffic\u201d and were redirected to a \u201cwaiting room\u201d that listed how many hundreds of people were trying to access the site ahead of them.",
      "Trump suggested in his post that he would be implementing some changes to the center's performance schedule, noting that last year \u201cthe Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth \u2014 THIS WILL STOP.\"",
      "According to its website, the center in July hosted a preshow titled \u201cA Drag Salute to Divas\u201d and a November \u201cDrag Brunch.\u201d",
      "In his post, Trump did not clarify which board of trustee members he would be terminating besides the current chairman, philanthropist David Rubenstein. The board often features political powerbrokers and major donors, and is currently made up of members from both sides of the aisle.",
      "Rubenstein was first elected to the post in 2010 and reelected each year since that time. Also, the principal owner of the Baltimore Orioles, Rubenstein was originally appointed to the Kennedy Center board by President George W. Bush and subsequently reappointed by President Barack Obama and Biden.",
      "The current board features Biden\u2019s White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, as well as Mike Donilon, Biden\u2019s longtime ally, and Stephanie Cutter, a former Obama adviser. The treasurer of the center\u2019s board of trustees is television producer Shonda Rhimes, who hosted fundraisers for Biden before he abandoned his reelection bid last summer.",
      "But the current board also features Trump allies, including Pam Bondi, the new president\u2019s recently confirmed attorney general, and Lee Greenwood, whose song \u201cGod Bless the USA,\u201d was the unofficial anthem of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.",
      "During his first term in 2019, Trump announced that he was tapping actor Jon Voight, a longtime supporter, to the board, along with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who he\u2019s picked as U.S. ambassador to Israel this time.",

      "As Republicans in Congress look for ways to slash spending, some legislators are floating new taxes on college scholarships, an end to student loan repayment plans and a big hike in taxes on university endowments.",
      "The ideas affecting higher education are among many in circulation among House committees that are exploring ways to cover the cost of extending and expanding tax cuts passed in President Donald Trump's first term.",
      "The recommendations are still evolving, and it's unclear how close any of them will get to being implemented. Regardless, advocates across higher education say they are alarmed to see such proposals gain traction at all with Republicans.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s shocking to me because this amount of cuts is not happening in reaction to like a budget crisis, like a recession. This really feels different in the sense that it is not something that there is an external push or a need for. So, it feels more ideological in a way,\u201d said Jessica Thompson, a higher education policy expert with The Institute for College Access and Success.",
      "Here is a look at possible federal budget cuts that would affect higher education under the Trump administration:",
      "The U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce has suggested several possible ways to overhaul student loan programs. Some would reduce student access to federal aid for college.",
      "On the chopping block potentially are several plans students can opt into to repay their students loans, including the SAVE plan introduced by the Biden administration. That plan doesn't require borrowers to make payments if they earn less than 225% of the federal poverty line \u2014 $32,800 a year for a single person \u2014 and prevents interest from adding to balances as long as borrowers make their monthly payments. The SAVE plan was already put on hold after Republicans challenged it. Some plans do not appear to be targeted, including one that caps loan payments based on borrowers' income level.",
      "Another possible change would give borrowers additional opportunities to recover from defaults. While they currently can rehabilitate their loans just once, allowing them to make a certain number of consecutive payments to get out of default, the proposal would allow them to go through that process twice. The committee projected the new process could save the government millions of dollars but did not spell out how.",
      "The timing is uncertain on when any of these proposals could surface. They could be considered as soon as this spring in a process known as budget reconciliation that would allow Republicans to squeeze proposals through Congress purely on party-line votes. That would not be easy in the House, where Republicans hold the majority by just a few seats.",
      "Scholarships and fellowships have been exempt from taxes as long as they are used for tuition and related expenses. That would change under another proposal that's up for consideration.",
      "The changes could create new financial burdens for students and families, advocates say.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been great progress in bringing down the costs of higher education. Adjusted for inflation, public university tuition is less now than it was ten years ago,\" said Craig Lindwarm, senior vice president of governmental affairs with the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities. \"But as we look at some of the proposals that are options, many would increase costs on students and families, and I think (the proposals) are heading in the direction that most don\u2019t want to see, which is increasing expenses on students and families.\u201d",
      "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act currently requires some private nonprofit colleges and universities to pay a 1.4% tax on income from their endowments, which raised about $244 million from 58 institutions in 2022. The committee suggests increasing that to a 14% tax and expanding which colleges would have to pay it.",
      "Also being considered among hundreds of other ideas in circulation are fines for colleges and universities that violate students' rights under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which protects against discrimination toward students of shared ancestry. Such investigations often have been resolved through settlements calling for training and policy updates. Title VI is currently what is being used to investigate complaints of antisemitism on college campuses across the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "Whitewater outfitters on the Nolichucky River are facing an uncertain future after Hurricane Helene devastated this scenic spot on the North Carolina-Tennessee border",
      "ERWIN, Tenn. -- After 24 years of guiding whitewater trips on the Nolichucky River Gorge for other companies, Patrick Mannion finally received a permit last year to operate his own outfitter business. But following the devastation of Hurricane Helene, he doesn't know if Osprey Whitewater will be around for a second year.",
      "Flooding driven by the September hurricane cut the fall rafting season short and devastated this mountainous region on the Tennessee-North Carolina border. Miles of railroad tracks and entire houses were thrown into the river. Some outfitters lost buildings and equipment. Guides lost their homes. Some lost friends. The river itself changed dramatically.",
      "But with the spring season set to open next month, the biggest problem outfitters are facing is silence from the U.S. Forest Service, which manages the river corridor and issues their permits to operate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting, interesting first season,\u201d said Mannion, who reckons he has run the scenic 8-mile (12.8-kilometer) gorge more than 3,500 times. \u201cIt was certainly not the end of our first season that we were hoping for.\u201d",
      "Whitewater rafting on the Nolichucky is a keystone of the local outdoor tourism industry, which helped generate over $18 million in visitor spending in Tennessee\u2019s Unicoi County in 2022, according to a study. While most rafting rivers in the Southeast are dam-controlled, the upper Nolichucky runs freely, making every trip a different experience and attracting boaters who seek adventure. It also feels particularly remote, flowing through a deep gorge surrounded by national forests with the occasional CSX train the only sign of human activity for miles.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no cellphone service. ...It\u2019s rugged. It\u2019s wild and scenic It\u2019s the steepest, the deepest and the most remote river corridor that\u2019s commercially rafted in the southeastern United States,\" said Mannion, who calls the river \u201cmy therapy.\u201d",
      "Matt Moses owns USA Raft, the largest and oldest outfitter on the river. The flood destroyed much of his business, taking out campgrounds, lodging, a day recreation area, vehicles and equipment. He is determined to rebuild, but the Forest Service is not making that easy.",
      "Moses said that typically this is the time of year that big groups book with companies like his. He has people answering phones, but they are not taking reservations.",
      "\u201cWe tell them that our future is uncertain,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019m not taking anybody\u2019s money. I\u2019ve got enough refunds I\u2019m trying to figure out.\"",
      "The Forest Service has temporarily closed the boat ramps in Poplar, North Carolina; and Erwin, Tennessee, where outfitters put in and take out rafts. CSX Transportation is using them as access points as it attempts to rebuild miles of railroad tracks lost to the flood. And that is yet another worry for the whitewater community.",
      "Mannion supports repairing the train tracks but has been disturbed by the sight of heavy equipment removing rock, sand and gravel from the riverbed to rebuild the railbed and embankment.",
      "A lawsuit filed in November by the nonprofit groups American Whitewater and American Rivers accuses federal regulators of failing to enforce the Clean Water Act and other laws, and failing to monitor the work that is being done. In the meantime, boaters have taken it on themselves to document the destruction, kayaking through the gorge in frigid winter conditions to shoot photos and videos from spots not visible from any road or trail.",
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers referenced video it had received of \u201cpotentially unauthorized work being conducted in the Nolichucky River\u201d in December, when it ordered a temporary halt to the reconstruction. The Corps later issued permits that Southern Environmental Law Center attorney Patrick Hunter says are insufficient to protect the river.",
      "A Jan. 21 letter from Hunter to the Corps suggests that CSX's plan to use material from the Nolichucky gorge as reconstruction material, rather than trucking it in from a quarry, will have \u201csignificant consequences for scenery, water quality, wildlife habitat, protected species, flood risk, recreation, and the navigability of the river.\u201d",
      "Mannion said it is perplexing that he had to go through a long, arduous process to get a permit to run rafting trips on the Nolichucky from the Forest Service while he believes CSX has not been held to the same standard.",
      "\u201cI think in the grand scheme of things, we just want to make sure that the I\u2019s are being dotted, the T\u2019s are being crossed, and that, in this remote corridor, that there is just a little bit of oversight, because I don\u2019t think that this would be happening if this was in downtown Erwin,\u201d he said.",
      "For his part, CSX President and CEO Joe Hinrichs has said they are working with the Corps to oversee the project, and \u201cI believe we\u2019re going to leave the territory better than we found it.\u201d",
      "The flooding moved huge boulders and made big changes to the river channel, but after running it many times since September, outfitters are excited.",
      "\u201cThe whitewater has gotten better,\u201d said Brannon Schmidt, of Blue Ridge Paddling. He is considering raising the age limit on trips \"because it has stepped up a bit in adventure.\u201d",
      "Schmidt and his brother Mason Schmidt spent five years working to get a permit for the Nolichucky before they were able to run their first trips there last year. They have a large building with a taphouse that was heavily damaged by the flooding, but they managed to save a majority of their equipment.",
      "\u201cThis next season we were definitely planning on going all out. You know, having a big springboard year. Yeah, the flood definitely is derailing that for us,\u201d Brannon Schmidt said.",
      "There is no timeline for when the Forest Service will open the river up to commercial rafting, Forest Service spokesperson Sheila Holifield said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "\"Safety of rafters and our commercial outfitter partners is one of our top priorities while we continue working to identify any hazards left by Helene in the Nolichucky, and we continue to advise the public to stay off the river for their own safety,\" Holifield wrote.",
      "The uncertainty around permits and concerns about what affect the CSX work will have on the river are making it hard to plan for the future, Schmidt said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about financial decisions like where your money\u2019s going to go to rebuild,\" he said. \"You know, if we are going to rebuild? Is the river going to be ruined? You know, there\u2019s all these questions.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- Donald Trump\u2019s second administration has put forth an avalanche of policy changes and political pronouncements that have jolted Washington and the world.",
      "That agenda is taken largely from his \u201cAgenda 47\u201d campaign proposals, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 and other hard-right influencers with juice in Trump\u2019s White House. There is much more, however, that the president and those groups discussed on the campaign trail but have yet to attempt.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some substantial proposals still pending.",
      "The right has long targeted the Department of Education, which became a Cabinet agency in 1980 under President Jimmy Carter. Trump aides have prepared an executive order that would limit if not effectively shut down the department.",
      "\u201cI want Linda to put herself out of a job,\u201d Trump said of Education Secretary-designee Linda McMahon, who awaits Senate confirmation.",
      "The timing, though, remains uncertain as the White House grapples with how to unwind an agency that was established by law and involves billions in spending approved by Congress, including Title I money for low-income schools and college student loans.",
      "Trump sidestepped and obfuscated on abortion during the campaign. He bragged that his Supreme Court nominees helped overturn the Roe v. Wade precedent and shifted control of abortion restrictions to state governments \u2014 but said he would not sign a national ban. Then he changed course and said he would ban abortion later in pregnancy, though he did not specify when that would be.",
      "Project 2025 proposes a range of ideas, most of which would come under the purview of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. if the Senate confirms him as Health and Human Services secretary:",
      "\u2014 It seeks tighter restrictions on abortion pills, demand for which rose after Trump's election. The document says the administration should revoke the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of medication abortion drugs. Short of that, if the drugs remain on the market, the document urges Trump to \u201creinstate earlier safety protocols for Mifeprex that were mostly eliminated in 2016 and apply these protocols to any generic version of mifepristone.\u201d Specifically, Project 2025 calls for \u201ca bare minimum\u201d deadline of the 49th day of gestation for dispensing the drugs (it is now 70 days), requiring in-person dispensing, and requiring prescribers to report \u201call serious adverse events, not just deaths.\u201d During his confirmation hearings last month, Kennedy said Trump has asked him to study mifepristone, a drug used to terminate pregnancies and help women complete miscarriages.",
      "\u2014 If those paths are not sufficient to limit medication abortions, it proposes invoking an 1873 anti-obscenity law, the Comstock Act, as justification to block the mailing of any abortion-related materials. When asked during an April 12, 2024, interview with Time magazine for his views on the Comstock Act and the mailing of abortion pills, Trump promised to make a statement on the issue in the next 14 days, saying: \u201cI feel very strongly about it. I actually think it\u2019s a very important issue.\u201d He never made that statement.",
      "\u2014 Project 2025 also calls to codify into law the Hyde and Weldon amendments, budget measures used to limit the use of federal money for abortion-related services. Dave Weldon, a former Republican lawmaker who sponsored the Weldon amendment, has been nominated to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u2014 And it calls for federal guidance declaring that emergency abortion care \u2013 such as for complications that could lead to sepsis \u2013 is not required under the 1986 law, signed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, that generally requires hospital emergency departments to meet a certain standard of care for all patients. Trump has been expected to pull back Biden administration guidance requiring emergency rooms to provide abortions when necessary to stabilize a woman's health or life.",
      "On the one hand, the 2024 Republican platform promised to \u201creturn education to the states.\u201d But the document, boosted by Trump\u2019s statements, also promises \u201c universal school choice \u201d \u2013 meaning to use the power of the federal government to implement private school tuition subsidies \u2013 and \u201cending teacher tenure,\u201d job protections usually defined at the state level. Additionally, Trump declared that parents of schoolchildren should be able to hire and fire principals, decisions typically made by local school superintendents and school boards.",
      "Trump did not detail how he would accomplish such national uniformity in K-12 schools. But, in general, his education ideas would make federal money conditional, and the administration\u2019s opening weeks suggest the White House believes it can use executive power to do that rather than go through Congress.",
      "In Agenda 47 and at rallies, candidate Trump described U.S. colleges and universities as havens for \u201cMarxist maniacs and lunatics.\u201d Trump proposed taking over the independent accreditation process for higher education institutions, calling that his \u201csecret weapon\u201d to transform the system. He took aim at higher education endowments, promising to collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts \u2013 like his crackdowns on diversity initiatives.",
      "Trump did not name schools in Agenda 47. But many well-regarded private universities hold endowments exceeding $10 billion, and the oldest Ivy League institutions \u2013 Harvard and Yale \u2013 measure theirs in the tens of billions. Of course, trying to commandeer private endowments would invite court fights, since they are legally protected funds from donors.",
      "Agenda 47 calls for redirecting captured endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charge.",
      "\u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed \u2014 none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump has imposed tariffs on China, which responded with its own levies. But there is a pause on border levies on goods from Mexico and Canada. Beyond that initial foray into the president\u2019s promised protectionism, Trump promised as a candidate to pursue \u201cThe Trump Reciprocal Trade Act\u201d in Congress, to reverse U.S. trade deficits and goose domestic production. He also called for \u201cbaseline tariffs,\u201d without making clear whether he meant through executive action or legislation.",
      "Trump more recently hailed the late 19th and early 20th century era when the federal government relied heavily on tariff revenue, before the income tax era began with the 16th Amendment\u2019s ratification in 1913. That era, however, also predates Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the Pentagon being responsible for the world\u2019s most expensive military. (Trump has explicitly promised to protect all those big-ticket items other than Medicaid.)",
      "The president\u2019s talk of tariff revenue aside, he has pledged a return of policies in the Republicans\u2019 sweeping 2017 overhaul. That package reached nearly every U.S. household but concentrated benefits among corporations and the wealthiest individual filers. Trump added 2024 campaign promises to exempt tips, Social Security benefits and overtime pay from income taxes.",
      "Congress is still contemplating tax changes.",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s promise on overtime wages, conservatives have separate ideas that would reduce the instances U.S. workers get overtime pay in the first place.",
      "Project 2025 calls for rescinding Biden administration rules that sought to expand qualifications for time-and-a-half overtime for about 4 million workers. The document also would curtail Biden-era rules that make it easier for gig economy workers \u2014 rideshare drivers, for example \u2014 to gain benefits as full-time employees rather than contract workers with fewer protections under labor law, including the standard 40-hour workweek threshold that triggers overtime pay.",
      "More broadly, Project 2025 calls for weakening the Fair Labor Standards Act and National Labor Relations Act \u2014 seminal laws from Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s presidency. The authors want Congress \u201cto authorize collective bargaining to treat national employment laws and regulations as negotiable defaults\u201d and allow waivers for states and local governments \u201cto encourage experimentation and reform efforts.\u201d",
      "Proposing looser safety rules, Project 2025 would make it easier for teenagers to work dangerous jobs and harder for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to investigate conditions and impose penalties on private-sector businesses.",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for labor secretary, meanwhile, is an organized labor ally. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, R-Ore., co-sponsored the PRO Act, a union-backed proposal that would make it easier for workers to organize. Trump, however, has offered no signs that he would support the law, and Republican leaders in the GOP-controlled House and Senate oppose the measure.",
      "Hyperbole or not, Trump insisted repeatedly as a candidate that he would quickly settle the war in Ukraine brought about by Russia\u2019s invasion and the Israel-Hamas war spawned by Hamas\u2019 slaughter of Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The Biden administration, with Trump transition team involvement, negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. But there is no permanent peace accord in place, and Trump has complicated matters with his musings about a U.S. takeover of Gaza.",
      "On Ukraine, Trump also said, \u201cI will ask Europe to reimburse us for the cost of rebuilding the stockpiles sent to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "He recently suggested Ukraine should reimburse the U.S. with access to its rare earth minerals as part of an agreement to continue military support against the Russian invasion.",

    "summary": "For transgender Americans, passports just became a lot more complicated",
    "story": [
      "For transgender Americans, passports just became a lot more complicated",
      "The day after President Donald Trump returned to office, Lisa Suhay took her 21-year-old daughter, Mellow, to a passport office in Norfolk, Virginia, where they live.",
      "Getting a passport for Mellow, who is transgender, was urgent.",
      "In an executive order Trump signed the night before, the president used a narrow definition of the sexes instead of a broader conception of gender. The order says a person is male or female and it rejects the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned at birth to another gender. The framing is in line with many conservatives' views but at odds with major medical groups and policies under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Her family wants Mellow to be able to leave the country if things became unbearable for transgender people in the U.S. as the federal government increasingly moves not to recognize them.",
      "\u201cIf the worst was to come to worst and things were to threaten my life,\u201d she said, \u201cI would have some way out.\u201d",
      "Trump's Jan. 20 order, which questions the existence of transgender and nonbinary people, created confusion and pain for Mellow and others seeking new, renewed or updated passports. A group of impacted people challenged the policy with a lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Boston.",
      "The State Department quickly stopped issuing travel documents with the \u201cX\u201d gender marker preferred by many nonbinary people, who don\u2019t identify as strictly male or female. The department also stopped allowing people to change the gender listed on their passport or get new ones that reflect their gender rather than their sex assigned at birth.",
      "Applications that had already been submitted seeking gender marker changes were put on hold. The State Department also replaced its webpage with information for \u201cLGBTQI+\u201d travelers to just \u201cLGB,\u201d removing any reference to transgender or intersex people.",
      "Knowing about the policy change, Mellow checked the box for \u201cmale,\u201d even though that\u2019s at odds with her life and her state-issued driver\u2019s license.",
      "\u201cWe had to swear oath to the fact that the information that we presented was true, even if what we had to do was not truthful to ourselves\u201d Mellow said. \u201cIt was emotional because it was in a way lying to yourself.\u201d",
      "Her mother worries that Mellow might not be granted a passport \u2014 or that it could create legal problems if her documents don't match or because she swore to something that's not true.",
      "The passport policy is among several actions Trump has taken since returning to office that could stifle rights and legal recognition of transgender, intersex and nonbinary people.",
      "The same order that seeks to define the sexes to exclude them would also require housing transgender women in prison in men's facilities. Additional orders could open the door to kicking transgender service members out of the military, barring the use of federal taxpayer money to provide gender-affirming care to transgender people under 19 and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women's sports competitions.",
      "The lawsuit filed Friday by ACLU lawyers challenging the passport change contends that the order discriminates against people based on their sex or transgender status, depriving them of their rights to equal protection, privacy and speech. It also contends the abrupt policy change violates the requirement for a 60-day notice and comment period.",
      "Trump's administration has said the policy would not affect existing unexpired passports.",
      "Groups such as New Jersey-based Garden State Equality warned transgender and nonbinary members that they could be at risk when returning to the U.S. after traveling abroad, particularly if their passport has the \u201cX\u201d gender marker.",
      "Elise Flatland, a mother of four in the Kansas City suburb of Olathe, Kansas, is still waiting to hear about whether a passport has been approved for her 12-year-old transgender son.",
      "The family filled out the application in December at the same time they requested passports for two of their other children. The others have arrived, but his has not. Flatland said it\u2019s essential to have the travel document so the family could go to another country for gender-affirming care if it becomes unavailable in the U.S.",
      "It would also help her son in other ways. A 2023 Kansas law left them unable to change his birth certificate, so he has no government-issued document that reflects his gender. Having one could help answer fellow sixth graders who question his identity, more so since Trump was elected in November.",
      "\u201cThere is definitely a sense of everyone being emboldened in their anti-trans, anti-LGBTQ attitudes, and they have no need to act politely in public,\u201d Flatland said.",
      "Anticipating a passport change, Ash Lazarus Orr, a West Virginia advocate for transgender people, sent in an expedited application to change the gender marker on his passport from \u201cF\u201d to \u201cM\u201d days before Trump took office.",
      "But it wasn't processed until after inauguration, and Orr doesn't expect the change will be made.",
      "A complication for Orr is that the State Department has his current passport, which doesn't expire for several years, his birth certificate and marriage license. That has put some upcoming international travel plans into question.",
      "He said he hopes his non-updated passport will be returned, so he can travel. \u201cWorst-case scenario, I could see this lost through the entire administration where I don\u2019t have a passport,\" Orr said.",
      "Zaya Perysian, a 22-year-old content creator who lives in Los Angeles, tried to change the gender mark on her passport once she heard about Trump's passport policy.",
      "She bought a plane ticket to Canada to serve as the basis for a request for expedited service. After an appointment at a passport office, she hoped the switch would be approved.",
      "Days later, her new passport arrived in the mail along with a letter explaining that the application had been \u201ccorrected\u201d to male.",
      "She said the issue is bigger than the travel document.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want any trans person to feel validated,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThey want it to go back to how it used to be, where we were seen as like these creatures, and that we were just like night stalkers.\u201d",
      "Both Orr and Perysian are among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit seeking to halt the policy."

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Just hours after finding 10 people dead in western Alaska from one of the deadliest plane crashes in the state in 25 years, authorities raced to recover their remains and the wreckage of the small commuter plane from unstable sea ice before expected high winds and snow.",
      "\u201cThe conditions out there are dynamic, so we\u2019ve got to do it safely in the fastest way we can,\u201d Jim West, chief of the Nome Volunteer Fire Department, said Friday.",
      "The Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane was traveling from Unalakleet to the hub community of Nome when it disappeared Thursday afternoon. It was found the next day after an extensive search with all nine passengers and the pilot dead.",
      "As the community tried to process the deadly event, crews worked swiftly on unstable, slushy sea ice to recover the bodies and the wreckage with less than a day before bad weather was expected. Officials said a Black Hawk helicopter would be used to move the aircraft once the bodies were removed.",
      "Among those killed in the crash were Rhone Baumgartner and Kameron Hartvigson. They had traveled to Unalakleet to service a heat recovery system vital to the community\u2019s water plant, according to the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.",
      "\u201cThese two members of our team lost their lives serving others,\u201d David Beveridge, vice president of environmental health & engineering for the organization, said in a statement. \"The loss of these two incredible individuals and everyone else on board the plane will be felt all over Alaska.\u201d",
      "The other people\u2019s names have not been released.",

      "The Cessna Caravan left Unalakleet at 2:37 p.m. Thursday, and officials lost contact with it less than an hour later, according to David Olson, director of operations for Bering Air. There was light snow and fog, with a temperature of 17 degrees (minus 8.3 Celsius), according to the National Weather Service.",
      "The Coast Guard said the aircraft went missing about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Nome.",
      "Radar forensic data provided by the U.S. Civil Air Patrol indicated that about 3:18 p.m., the plane had \u201csome kind of event which caused them to experience a rapid loss in elevation and a rapid loss in speed,\u201d Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said. \u201cWhat that event is, I can't speculate to.\u201d",
      "McIntyre-Coble said he was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft. Planes carry an emergency locating transmitter. If exposed to seawater, the device sends a signal to a satellite, which then relays that message back to the Coast Guard to indicate an aircraft may be in distress. No such messages were received by the Coast Guard, he said.",
      "Rescuers were searching the aircraft\u2019s last known location by helicopter when the wreckage was spotted, said Mike Salerno, a spokesperson for the U.S. Coast Guard. Two rescue swimmers were lowered to investigate.",
      "Local, state and federal agencies had assisted in the search effort, combing stretches of ice-dotted waters and scouring miles of frozen tundra.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board was sending nine people to the scene from various states.",
      "Flying is an essential mode of transportation in Alaska due to the vastness of the landscape and limited infrastructure. Most communities are not connected to the developed road system that serves the state\u2019s most populous region, and it\u2019s common to travel by small plane.",
      "Some high school teams fly to sporting events against rival high schools, and goods are brought to many communities by barge or by air.",
      "The plane's crash marks the third major U.S. aviation mishap in eight days. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation\u2019s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people.

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s order declaring diversity, equity and inclusion policies illegal has thrown into doubt the future of research Kendra Dahmer has been doing on intestinal parasites in India and Benin",
      "BERKELEY, Calif. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in programs receiving federal money has thrown into doubt the future of research Kendra Dahmer has been doing on intestinal parasites in India and Benin.",
      "Dahmer, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, has a grant from the National Institutes of Health, the single largest public funder of biomedical research in the world.",
      "The grant is supposed to cover her research through the summer of 2026, but now she wonders if that will be possible. She received diversity-based funding as the first college graduate in her family and a woman in science and, more broadly, she is uncertain how Trump\u2019s anti-DEI executive order could affect support for her areas of study.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s also this aspect of research that funds specific studies in specific populations that are now being deemed DEI,\u201d Dahmer said. \u201cSo, like HIV research in Africa may be deemed DEI, malaria research, which also happens in low and middle income countries, may be considered DEI. And these are really important diseases that kill hundreds of thousands of people every year.\u201d",
      "Two days after Trump signed the executive order on DEI on Jan. 21 researchers became even more alarmed when the White House called for a funding freeze to conduct an ideological review of all federal grants and loans. After days of chaos and legal wrangling, two judges intervened and the administration rescinded the freeze. The National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation, which fund a large chunk of research in the country, this week began releasing grants.",
      "But that hasn\u2019t eased the fears of scientists and researchers whose work is funded by federal grants. The NSF said it is still conducting a review of \"projects, programs and activities to be compliant with the existing executive orders.\u201d It\u2019s not yet clear what may happen to new and existing NIH grants either.",
      "Universities, which received almost $60 billion for research in the 2023 fiscal year, have been mostly quiet, explaining in statements to their staff and students they are still trying to clarify the executive order's implications for their research funding. Meantime, they are navigating the order's impact on their own institutional policies supporting underrepresented students.",
      "The University of California said in a statement it is \u201cevaluating recent executive orders issued by President Trump and the subsequent agency guidance to understand their potential impact on our communities.\u201d",
      "Even though there is no clarity on the new policies yet, some projects already have been put on hold amid uncertainty over the future of research touching on issues related to diversity, said Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors.",
      "Some of the studies already being halted include research on artificial intelligence and how racism can be coded into systems, he said. Other projects Wolfson has heard about getting stopped include research on health equity and studies on the urban literacy rate as it relates to class in places with large concentrations of Black people.",
      "\u201cI think the people who are making these decisions are very clear that they want to create a society that\u2019s based on deep-set inequities that are hard baked and don\u2019t transform whether that\u2019s around race, whether that\u2019s around class, whether that\u2019s around gender,\u201d he said.",
      "The Education Department did not respond to an email message seeking comment.",
      "Threats to funding for research related to DEI could eliminate a lifeline for historically Black colleges and universities, which are already significantly underfunded compared to predominantly white institutions.",
      "North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, the largest HBCU in the country, has been on a yearslong mission to become one of the first to reach R1 status \u2014 a distinction from the Carnegie Foundation that denotes a university as having high research activity, but the president\u2019s intervention on federal funding could slow that down, said Joseph Graves, a biology professor. As it is, biology department students have to conduct research in hats and gloves during the winter because of a lack of heat in the old building, he said.",
      "New scrutiny on federal research grants could also hurt students at HBCUs who have federally funded fellowships for research, Graves said. Those scholarships, which could be at risk, allow minority students to pursue opportunities they might not have been able to afford.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s perception of diversity, equity and inclusion could make HBCUs a target because of its high population of minority students, Graves said.",
      "\u201cThey will look at our excellence in doing work that is changing the demography of science, and they will attack it as DEI,\u201d Graves said. \u201cWhatever we do, we\u2019re doing DEI whether they like it or not.\u201d",

      "A record 13 women had been serving as governor this year",
      "PHOENIX -- South Dakota\u2019s constitution refers to the governor as a \u201che.\u201d",
      "But for the past six years, the governor was a \u201cshe\u201d \u2014 Kristi Noem, the first female to hold the position there. The conservative Republican pushed a constitutional amendment to change the gendered language. But voters rejected the measure in the 2024 general election that also would have been inclusive of nonbinary people.",
      "Across the nation, state constitutions presume officeholders are male, and they increasingly are outdated. This year, a record of 13 women were serving as governor before Noem stepped down to serve in President Donald Trump's Cabinet. In state legislatures, 2,469 women are serving, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.",
      "Most states haven't modernized their constitutions to reflect the rise of women in politics. Among those that have are New York's, which became gender-neutral in 2001, and Vermont's, where voters approved a change from \u201cmen\u201d to \u201cpersons\u201d in 1994.",
      "An effort in Washington state to update the state's constitution died in a legislative committee in 2023. In Connecticut, state Sen. Mae Flexer says she'll make another run at revising the constitution in this year's legislative session. Some states, like Nevada and California, have made changes within their legislatures to refer to lawmakers as assemblymembers instead of assemblymen or assemblywomen.",
      "\u201cLanguage matters, it conveys a message about values, it conveys a message about who belongs,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics.",

      "\u201cThe South Dakota state constitution requires the governor to begin each legislative session by giving the Legislature information concerning the affairs of the state and recommending the measures he considers necessary,\u201d Noem said. \u201cNotice I didn\u2019t say \u2018she.\u2019 The constitution doesn\u2019t say she, and maybe we should fix that sometime.\"",
      "A few months later, Noem signed a bill to update male references to more gender-neutral language in state law, such as changing \u201che shall deem\u201d to \u201cthe Governor deems.\u201d But amending the state's founding document requires voter approval \u2014 and South Dakotans didn't go for it.",
      "The bill's sponsor, Republican state Sen. Erin Tobin, saw it as a way to reflect the state's progress in electing women and celebrating them. She said the amendment failed partly because of the word \u201cpronoun\u201d in the ballot question.",
      "It entangled the effort with the broader conservative sentiment that \u201cnonbinary\u201d is not a legitimate gender identity. Others cited a lack of campaigning for or against the measure and concerns over the financial cost of making a change.",
      "Although \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d are inherently inclusive of many transgender people who use those pronouns, Noem has a track record opposing gender transitions.",
      "Noem signed a bill in 2023 prohibiting gender-affirming care for youth and in 2022 signed a bill banning transgender girls and college-age women from playing in school sports leagues that match their gender identity.",
      "Noem resigned her office in late January to oversee the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under Trump, who issued an executive order last month directing the federal government to recognize only two sexes \u2014 male and female. Trump also signed an executive order Wednesday that intended to prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports.",

      "\u201cThat is one of my biggest oppositions to this,\u201d Schaefbauer said. \u201cWe are male and female, and when this was gender-neutralized in the constitution, it was taking away the personhood and that is not how I live my life.\u201d",
      "Neil Fulton, dean of the University of South Dakota School of Law, said that masculine pronouns have long been understood to encompass all people and its usage in the state constitution reflects the drafting convention at the time.",
      "\u201cCertainly we know that the officeholder limits in South Dakota have never been interpreted to preclude female officeholders,\u201d said Fulton. \u201cWhy? We have a female governor and we\u2019ve had a variety of statewide female elected officials previously.

      "As jobs become more reliant on technology some Latino workers can be left behind due to a lack of digital skills exacerbated by a lack of accessibility.",
      "Latinos remain an integral part of jobs in agriculture, construction, retail and food services but these jobs are also at risk of automation, leaving some Latinos unprepared for a changing role that relies more on technology, according to a new report by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "Analysis from the UCLA Latino Policy Institute shows Latinos are overrepresented in fields at risk of automation. The report also provides some suggestions on how to improve Latino economic mobility.",
      "\u201cThis report sheds light on a critical but often overlooked reality: Automation is not just a technological issue but an equity issue, said Misael Gald\u00e1mez, co-author of the report, \u201cOn the Frontlines: Automation Risks for Latino Workers in California.\u201d",
      "\u201cLatino workers are on the frontline of automation risk, facing barriers like limited English proficiency, low digital access and educational gaps,\u201d Gald\u00e1mez said.",
      "Valerie Gills, 32, spent three years as a receptionist at a hotel in Phoenix, but in 2023, the hotel set up self-check kiosks and installed AI-powered chatbots on its website to handle reservations and requests. The changes made it clear that Gills was no longer essential.",
      "\u201cI knew businesses were always trying to improve efficiency,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it seemed to me as though technology was taking opportunities away from us.\u201d",
      "Gills eventually lost her job. She found temporary positions but nothing as stable as her hotel job had been. Her employment troubles weighed on her mental health and \u201creminded me how weak workers like me can be when industries get everything automated.\u201d",
      "Ramiro Cavazos, president and CEO of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said that while automation displaces those with limited skills, it can also create new roles, provide better working conditions and prevent burnout.",
      "\u201cAutomation affects people that don\u2019t have access to the Internet,\u201d Cavazos said. \u201cLatinos, who traditionally are the ones impacted, have made great progress as we become more educated, more skilled.\u201d",
      "As Gills looked for a new job, the reality set in: She would need to learn a new skill to stay ahead of the curve. Ultimately she was able to get an internship as a blog editor, but she is actively looking for a tech-study program in data analytics and software development, including boot camps online, so she can be a competitive candidate.",
      "Cavazos said the Hispanic Chamber works with over 500 foundations to ensure corporations contribute to providing skills training that Latinos need to compete in the current job market. He has seen a lot of investment to ensure Latino workers have the skills they need to succeed.",
      "During former President Joe Biden's administration, the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s division on employment and training focused on providing Latinos a pathway to learn new skills through apprenticeship programs, said Manny Lamre, then deputy assistant secretary for employment and training. According to Lamare, the apprenticeships were perfect for Latinos as they met their needs to have high-paying, family-supporting careers.",
      "\u201cWe do think it\u2019s really important to continue to engage individuals and meet them where they are,\u201d Lamarre said at the time. \u201cQuite frankly the Biden-Harris Administration has been intentional about making investments supporting Latino and Hispanic communities. We are hopeful those investments continue.\u201d",
      "Department of Labor officials under President Donald Trump, who has issued several orders targeting diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, did not immediately confirm whether the apprenticeship programs are still active.",
      "Carlos Vasquez, founder of Miami Ed Tech, a nonprofit focused on providing skills Latino students need for upward mobility, said apprenticeships are extremely favorable to Latinos as they are paying jobs from day one with a promise of training from an organization.",
      "Miami Ed Tech offers two apprenticeships in AI, data science and web design.",
      "\u201cEveryone thinks it\u2019s only for like, the trades,\u201d Vazquez said. \u201cBut that was the other thing that the Biden administration really pushed, is building more apprenticeships in nontraditional and emerging sectors. So we are kind of like, trying to also emulate that by offering in our community any employer who doesn\u2019t know but wants to get involved, because there\u2019s a lot of benefits. So it\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\u201d",
      "Historically, Latinos have always been impacted by automation due to their relation to labor-intensive roles, especially in retail and food service. Cavazos said it is crucial to \u201cteach Latinos more digital skills to evolve with the workforce.\u201d",
      "A study by UCLA this year found that in California, 2.3 million Latinos are employed in roles most at risk of becoming automated. Of the Latinos working in automation, 21% of them do not have access to high-speed internet at home, a hindrance to digital upskilling, the study found. A 2021 Pew Research study also found that only 67% of Hispanic adults reported owning a desktop or laptop computer, compared with 8 in 10 white adults.",
      "Diana Caba, vice president for community and economic development at the Hispanic Federation, said that as the world becomes more digital, it can become a huge obstacle for Latinos who do not have digital skills. Therefore the nonprofit has partnered with over 50 community-based organizations to decrease the digital divide by providing Latinos training, including access to technology.",
      "Caba said that of the 35,000 people they've trained, 70% have completed the training. She said 6,000 have gone on to new jobs, and about 10,500 have gotten a six-figure salary.",
      "\u201cAutomation is a big threat for our community, considering that we are in these low-paying sectors that are actually very vulnerable and don\u2019t really offer much opportunities for economic mobility,\u201d Caba said. \u201cIt\u2019s been really exciting to take this approach and meet the needs of increasing the digital acumen of the Latino community.\u201d",
      "Dylan Pravia started as an intern with Miami Ed Tech, which he said provided him the opportunity to use computers and learn about AI and programming. He is now able to use what he learned there as a mechanical engineering student at Florida International University.",
      "\u201cI really like what Miami Ed Tech is doing,\u201d Pravia said. \u201cThey are providing that training, that opportunity, to students. Talent is everywhere, and we should give (Latino) students as much training as they can, all those opportunities, so we can see the talent and their skills in the world.\u201d",
      "Gills, the former hotel receptionist, said she understands technology is the future but automation feels like a double-edged sword. While it can open opportunities for high-skilled labor, it also diminishes the number of low-skill jobs that many Latinos need, she said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen firsthand how many co-workers were swapped for kiosks or chatbots,\u201d Gills said. \u201cRetraining workers and preparing them for new jobs needs to be better supported by the system. To be honest, these times with automation and AI feel very unreliable and constantly changing, but I guess we just have to learn how to adapt.\u201d",

      "Carlos Favian Martinez, son-in-law to former Gulf Cartel drug lord, Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n, entered a guilty plea before a federal court in Houston to charges including conspiracy to fix prices, monopolizing, interfering with commerce by extortion and money laundering. Nine others were also indicted in November 2022 for their participation.",
      "Prosecutors alleged the eleven-year scheme started in 2011 and involved fixing prices of forwarding agency services operating in Los Indios, Texas, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Brownsville. The port of entry is used by thousands of migrants every year who buy used vehicles in the U.S. and drive them back to Central America through the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The indictment and court testimony highlighted beatings, kidnappings and fatal shootings that were part of the conspiracy between the defendants who used brutal force against several people who charged less for their services or who were noncompliant with the extortion tax.",
      "Martinez's relationship to Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n was discussed during a detention hearing held in July 2023 when a federal agent said Martinez spoke of his relationships across the border in Matamoros and Reynosa during a kidnapping. The agent said Martinez married the daughter of the drug lord, Guill\u00e9n, a 57-year-old native of the border city of Matamoros, Mexico, who started a violent brand of cartel violence through the formation of the Zetas.",
      "On Thursday, Martinez entered a guilty plea as first reported by local media. The plea agreement outlined an 11-year imprisonment term, though a sentencing hearing is scheduled in May.",
      "\u201cAfter two years of litigation we were able to arrive at a mutual agreement that calls for a sentence of eleven years,\u201d Kent A. Schaffer, an attorney representing Martinez, said in a statement provided to The Associated Press. \u201cMr. Martinez has been incarcerated since his arrest over two years ago and sees this resolution as one that will get him back home as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Martinez's father-in-law was recently sent back to Mexico after serving a portion of his sentence in the U.S. The former drug lord is facing drug, organized crime and money-laundering charges in Mexico."

      "It's common for news outlets to occupy space in places like the White House and state Capitols for quicker access to officials they need to do their jobs, and get stories out quickly. The Pentagon isn't preventing the ousted outlets from covering them, just making it more difficult for them to do their jobs.",
      "CNN, in a statement, said that its \u201cmission to report on the Department of Defense, U.S. military and Trump administration will continue regardless of office arrangements. We will not be deflected from our duty to hold all three fairly and fully to account.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Every dog at this week's Westminster Kennel Club show is a champion",
      "NEW YORK -- The competitors can come in forms as different as a Chihuahua, a great Dane, a bulldog and a greyhound. Each one is a champion. So how is a judge to decide which dog is the best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club competition?",
      "To the casual viewer, it might be hard to fathom what judges glean from patting down and peering at carefully prepped canines. But choosing a winner at the United States' most storied dog show requires an encyclopedic knowledge of 201 different breeds and varieties. And it takes some steady nerves.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re judging at Westminster on any level, it\u2019s unlike any other judging experience,\u201d said Donald Sturz, who awarded the top prize in 2022 to a bloodhound named Trumpet. Sturz is now the kennel club's president as the show returns to Madison Square Garden this week after four years elsewhere.",
      "\u201cYou walk out onto the floor of, you know, the world\u2019s most famous arena, and the world is watching,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you do have a moment where you\u2019re like, \u2018My God, what am I going to do?\u2019\u201d",
      "Judges perform hands-on examinations and watch dogs in motion to discern which one comes closest to the ideal for its breed, as set out in a \u201cstandard\u201d that details desired features. It's meant to reflect a breed\u2019s roots and historic function.",
      "Consider, for example, a Pekingese \u2014 specifically, Fiona, Sturz' 18-month-old pet, show champion and obliging model when he demonstrated for Associated Press journalists how judges work. (Fiona, a niece of 2021 Westminster winner Wasabi, is not competing at this year's show.)",
      "A clinical psychologist and retired suburban school district superintendent, Sturz has shown dogs since he was 10 and judged them for decades. He looks for \u201cpresence of virtue, versus faults\u201d and focuses on \u201cthe dog that rang the most bells of virtue for me as I went from nose to tail.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating with Fiona, Sturz started by scrutinizing the big, round eyes on the little dog's dark, flat face. He rested his hands on top and bottom of her head to check whether it was duly \u201cenvelope-shaped.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe head is a hallmark of the breed,\u201d descended from ancient Chinese palace dogs that were prized as self-assured companions with a lionlike look, he said.",
      "Then he felt the shape of Fiona's forelegs, the depth of her chest, the length of her neck, the breadth of her ribs and how much her body tapered from her forequarters to her rear. The standard calls for Pekingese to be pear-shaped, compact and low-slung.",
      "As Fiona continued to stand serenely on a table, it was time to check out the shape of her back, the texture of her voluminous, tawny coat and the way her tail sits. The hands-on examination ended with Sturz gently lifting Fiona \u2014 her breed is supposed to \u201cpick up heavy,\u201d or feel quite substantial for its size, he said.",
      "The next step is, well, steps. Judges watch each dog walk with its handler. Pekes are known for their slow, rolling gait, which Sturz describes by invoking both the stride of a heavyset rugby player and the wavy grace of a swimming goldfish.",
      "Judges also pay attention to a dog's temperament \u2014 Fiona projected a comfortable, tail-wagging confidence \u2014 and whether its overall condition indicates proper exercise, nutrition, care and grooming, Sturz said.",
      "Dog shows start with judges picking a top dog from each breed. Each of those competes against the others in its \u201cgroup,\u201d such as hounds or, for Pekingese, toy dogs. The seven group winners then face off for best in show.",
      "Westminster sequesters the best-in-show judge through all the preceding action. The person is expected to know the standard for every breed but is allowed to ask which ones (though not which particular dogs) are going into the final ring. Sturz said he chose not to inquire because he wanted a completely blank slate.",
      "\u201cAs a judge in best in show at Westminster, you really can\u2019t go wrong because you know a case could be made for any one of the seven of them,\u201d he said.",
      "So what makes a winner?",
      "\u201cA great dog having a great night,\u201d Sturz said. \u201cThere\u2019s just something that that dog brings that night that just put them a notch above the other great dogs in the ranks.\u201d",

      "Rainbows emerge so often in Hawaii they've become popular symbols of island life. Pictures of them adorn buildings, the sides of public buses and appear on standard vehicle license plates. University of Hawaii sports teams are even named after rainbows.",
      "\u201cFor me, rainbows really signify hope and new beginnings,\u201d said Liane Usher, the president of the Children's Discovery Center in Honolulu, which features rainbows on its exterior wall and in its exploration rooms. \u201cI can\u2019t ever help but smile whenever I see a rainbow after the rain.\u201d",
      "Here are some things to know about rainbows in Hawaii.",
      "Rainbows form when raindrops refract sunlight into a spectrum of colors. The brighter the sun, the clearer the rainbow.",
      "Look for them when it is both sunny and raining at the same time. They will appear opposite the sun. They will seem larger and higher in the sky in the early morning and late afternoon, when the sun is lower on the horizon.",
      "Steven Businger, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, says the archipelago's trade winds bring many small showers with enough blue sky between them for the sun to shine through.",
      "Hawaii's clean air also helps. Other places tend to have more air particles from dust, pollen and cars. Conditions improve further during Hawaii's rainy season, which lasts from October through April.",
      "\u201cHawaii has maybe the best rainbows on the planet,\u201d Businger said.",
      "Businger created an app called RainbowChase to help people find rainbows in Hawaii.",
      "Rainbows are so prevalent that there are about 20 names for them in the Hawaiian language, according to a Manoa website, including distinct words for rainbow fragments and those that sit low on the horizon.",
      "Rainbows represent divine or supernatural power in Native Hawaiian tradition.",
      "Sam 'Ohu Gon III, senior scientist and cultural adviser at The Nature Conservancy in Hawaii, said rainbows are considered a symbol of K\u0101ne, one of the four main gods in Hawaiian tradition. Traditionally, the closer one got to a rainbow, the more likely they were to encounter a supernatural force, or an extremely powerful or chiefly person, he said.",
      "In one centuries-old story, a rainbow appears over the secluded home of a Hawaiian princess for four straight days. Another emerges above the ocean when her suitor arrives, a man so strong his punch pierces an opponent\u2019s chest like a spear.",
      "To Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu, a teacher and Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner, a rainbow signals an \u201caumakua,\u201d which is a deified ancestor or a family or personal god.",
      "\u201cWhen those of our loved ones go before us, they precede us in life and they leave us in this realm. They are able sometimes to show their presence,\" Wong-Kalu said. \"The rainbow is one of those ways.\u201d",
      "Rainbows let her know spiritual protection is present and that she is loved and watched over, said Wong-Kalu, who is also known as Kumu Hina.",
      "Rainbow imagery decorates everything from buildings and restaurant facades to athletic uniforms.",
      "The Hawaii men\u2019s athletic teams are called Rainbow Warriors and the women\u2019s teams are Rainbow Wahine, using the Hawaiian word for women. The teams are called \u2018Bows\u2019 for short.",
      "The origin of the rainbow mascot dates to New Year's Day in 1924. Hawaii was locked in a scoreless tie against the visiting Oregon Aggies when a rainbow appeared over the field. Hawaii scored soon after and reporters began calling the team the Rainbows, according to the book \u201cHawai'i Sports: History, Facts and Statistics.\u201d",
      "The Hawaii football team in 2000 dropped \u201cRainbow\u201d from its nickname when a coach expressed concern it carried a \u201cstigma\u201d because of its association with the LGBTQ+ community. The school restored the name in 2013.",
      "When Kimberly Carlson was a professor at Manoa, she saw a rainbow outside her apartment window that made her wonder how climate change would affect them.",
      "Now a New York University environmental studies professor, she's studied the impact over the next century.",
      "Her team's analysis, published in a paper two years ago, predicts Brazil, the Mediterranean and parts of Central Africa will have fewer rainbows by 2100. They found places that currently get lots of snow, but that will instead receive more rain, will likely see more rainbows. Alaska falls in that category.",
      "Scientists believe rainbows will continue to be plentiful in Hawaii, but in the coming decades, longer dry spells might lead to fewer rainbows on the arid, leeward sides of the islands, Businger, the atmospheric sciences professor, said. Maui and the Big Island might be particularly affected, he said.",
      "The singular experience of glimpsing a rainbow makes them worth studying, he said.",
      "\u201cRainbows are a cultural touchstone for us. They cause us to stand still and for a moment, forget about the past and the future,\u201d Businger said. \u201cWe are really in the moment when we see a spectacular rainbow, and that\u2019s a rare experience in our busy lives.\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2025 08:18:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Republican skepticism in the Senate of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s Cabinet nominees has been worn down",
    "story": [
      "Republican skepticism in the Senate of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees has been worn down",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republican skepticism in the Senate of President Donald Trump\u2019sCabinet nominees has been worn down, putting his unconventional choices for some of the most powerful positions in the federal government on the verge of confirmation.",
      "Floor votes are expected this week on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in line to be the nation's health secretary, and Tulsi Gabbard, the choice for director of national intelligence. Both are from outside traditional Republican circles and espoused views in the confirmation process that alarmed GOP senators at times. Still, their nominations have advanced to the full Senate after crucial committee votes.",
      "One by one, Republicans have acquiesced to Trump's picks, even those whose personal history, lack of experience and unorthodox views would have once made them hardly imaginable for a Cabinet.",
      "It's a striking demonstration of how GOP lawmakers are standing by as Trump, in a show of force, disrupts the federal government and installs loyalists to lead key departments. Republican leaders in the Senate, eager to show Trump their worth, have chalked up confirmations at a rapid clip.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, just a month into the role, has lined up a vote on Gabbard as the first order of business, followed by Kennedy later in the week. Already on the job is Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who faced allegations over drinking and aggressive behavior toward women. And Republicans appear ready to soon install Kash Patel as FBI director.",
      "Those four nominees were long seen on Capitol Hill as the most vulnerable to losing support from Republicans, who hold a Senate majority by three seats.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s never any guarantees, but we\u2019re trending in the right direction,\u201d Thune, R-S.D., said as the Senate wrapped up its work Thursday night and dozens of Republicans headed to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort to meet with the president over the weekend.",
      "Thune's cautious optimism followed a week where the prospect of opposition from Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Todd Young of Indiana \u2014 both of whom have tried to maintain some independence from Trump \u2014 threatened to derail Kennedy and Gabbard. But after a series of intense phone calls and negotiations led by Vice President JD Vance, even in the moments leading up to committee votes Tuesday, the new leadership team persuaded the key holdouts to come around.",
      "Both walked away from the talks speaking of assurances the nominees would restrain some of their more worrisome views.",
      "The collapse of resistance has set a new tone in the Republican-controlled government and shown how even the most independent-minded lawmaker would rather work with Trump than risk crossing him. Trump himself has refrained from the threats to GOP skeptics that defined his first term and relied on Vance, a former Ohio senator, to quietly walk some of his former colleagues through their concerns.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t think of this just as a normal president coming into office for the first time,\u201d said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., who was involved in the effort to get Trump's nominees across the finish line. \u201cEverybody I was dealing with was truly undecided trying to get to yes, and so it was just a process.\"",
      "It didn't always look that easy.",
      "Cassidy, a liver doctor, told Kennedy during a committee hearing that he was \u201cstruggling\u201d to support the nomination because Kennedy had built a following as a vaccine skeptic and refused to denounce a discredited theory that vaccines cause autism. Cassidy cited his ethics as a doctor \u2014 \u201cdedicating my life to saving lives\u201d \u2014 as a chief cause for his concern.",
      "Young, a former intelligence officer in the Marine Corps, questioned past statements that Gabbard has made, including support for government leaker Edward Snowden and expressions of sympathy for Russia. Young said he sought written assurances from Gabbard that she would punish those who disclose sensitive government intelligence. Vance played a crucial role, brokering a letter from Gabbard that spelled out those assurances.",
      "\u201cI got them at the 11th hour,\u201d Young said after his committee vote for Gabbard.",
      "Young said Vance approached him with a \u201crespectful\u201d tone and \u201clistened a lot more than he talked.\u201d",
      "It's a change from Vance's Senate tenure, when he often defied the GOP leadership under Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell. Now Vance is working closely with the new team.",
      "A similar process played out with Cassidy. He said he voted to advance Kennedy after \u201cintense conversations\u201d and reassurances on how health agencies would handle vaccine recommendations. The senator thanked Vance for his \u201chonest counsel.\u201d",
      "Cassidy and Young insisted that the political fallout from blocking Trump's Cabinet picks did not factor into their negotiations, but the stakes were clear. Cassidy, who is up for reelection in two years, already has a primary challenger after voting to convict Trump on an impeachment charge in 2021 stemming from Trump's role in the Capitol riot.",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said that regardless whether Trump offers senators such as Cassidy or Young a campaign endorsement, no Republican wants to openly defy the president.",
      "\u201cI think that Donald Trump at his heart is ultimately a transactional guy,\" Cramer said, adding, \u201cWhether you ever get an endorsement out of it, not having an active enemy. He can be pretty effective as you know and he's proven, so nobody wants to be in that spot.\"",
      "That leaves Democrats almost powerless to stand in the way of Trump's Cabinet selections. With Republican support in line, Democrats had little recourse but to draw out the process through every procedural move possible. They are also trying to hold the Senate floor for maximum debate time to slow the pace of votes.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he hoped the tactic would call attention to Trump's expansion of presidential power and help \u201cpersuade the American people to express outrage to their members of Congress, particularly from the red states, where so far their senators have been unwilling or unable to listen.\u201d"

    "summary": "Leslie Knox has made history as one of the newest residents of Hamtramck, Michigan",
    "story": [
      "Leslie Knox has made history as one of the newest residents of Hamtramck, Michigan",
      "HAMTRAMCK, Mich. -- Leslie Knox was a young girl in the 1960s when her Detroit-area city was accused of destroying neighborhoods to get rid of Black residents.",
      "Decades later, the retired nurse has returned to Hamtramck, settling into a new two-story home on Gallagher Street and watching TV from a fold-up chair while she figures out how she wants to furnish it. She has no mortgage to pay, just property taxes and insurance.",
      "Knox is one of the last people to benefit from an extraordinary legal settlement that requires the small city to build 200 homes for the victims of discrimination or their families. A lawsuit filed in 1968 became one of the longest-running civil rights cases over housing in the United States.",
      "And it's finally over.",
      "\u201cI feel like I've been given this house by divine intervention because no man in their right mind would just hand the keys to houses,\u201d said Knox, 70, who placed two Black angel figurines on a kitchen window. \"I believe God put me here.\"",
      "Amer Ghalib, a native of Yemen and Hamtramck's mayor, said a \u201cdark chapter\u201d in the city's history is now closed.",
      "\u201cThis is not going to happen again,\" said Ghalib, who was elected in 2021. \"We are a very diverse community.\u201d",
      "In the early 1900s, Hamtramck's blue-collar jobs attracted immigrants from Eastern Europe, especially Poland. The association was so deep that Catholic Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Poland visited the city in 1969 and returned in 1987 \u2014 as Pope John Paul II. A statue of him stands high above a public plaza.",
      "Yet while white people felt welcomed, many Black residents said their civil rights were violated. In 1971, after a trial, U.S. District Judge Damon Keith ruled that the city had intentionally targeted certain Black neighborhoods by demolishing low-income housing.",
      "\u201cIt was an attempt to eliminate a Black population,\u201d said Michael Barnhart, a lawyer for the victims. \u201cIt wasn't, \u2018We want this land for something and therefore you\u2019re in the way.\u2019 \u2018We just want you gone\u2019 \u2014 that was the motivation, to get rid of people.\"",
      "Hamtramck spent years appealing before agreeing in 1981 to a remedy: It would build apartments for seniors as well as 200 scattered housing units for families. People with certain income levels and a connection to the class-action lawsuit would get priority.",
      "So why did the promise take until 2024 \u2014 more than 40 years \u2014 to fulfill?",
      "\u201cThe city didn't have the money,\u201d said James Allen, an attorney who represented Hamtramck during the last stages of the litigation.",
      "Indeed, city government twice was placed under state oversight, starting in 2000, due to financial problems. There still were dozens of homes left to build or rehab in 2010 when the judge and Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm held a festive ribbon-cutting ceremony at a new address on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.",
      "\u201cMost if not all of the construction funding was through federal and state grants,\u201d Allen explained. \u201cIf the city had been left to its own devices, they never would have been able to do it. They just didn\u2019t have the resources.\u201d",
      "The total cost to build the last three houses was approximately $1 million, he said.",
      "Throughout much of its history, Hamtramck rose and fell with the auto industry. More than 30,000 people worked at a local Chrysler factory, known as Dodge Main, in the 1950s. By 1980, the year the factory closed, the workforce was just a fraction of that number, and the population had plummeted. Polish Americans were slowly moving out, and Hamtramck became a gateway for new arrivals from Yemen, Bangladesh, Bosnia and elsewhere.",
      "Still a gritty, dense community of just 2 square miles, Hamtramck remains defined by two-story flats with small yards and narrow paths between homes. Today, General Motors makes electric vehicles at a plant that straddles Hamtramck and Detroit, and the population has rebounded to 27,000, 20% higher than in 2010 and holding steady, though nowhere near the peaks of the early 20th century when it was double.",
      "Median household income was $40,000 in 2023 compared to $71,000 statewide, the Census Bureau said.",
      "Now, the mayor and city council members are all Muslim. A stretch of Holbrook Street was formally renamed Palestine Avenue during the Israel-Hamas war. Amar Pizza, influenced by Bangladeshi tastes, was named one of the best pizzerias in America last year by The New York Times.",
      "St. Ladislaus Catholic Church, where a future pope had visited, is closed and for sale, while calls to Muslim daily prayer are amplified.",
      "\u201cSometimes they\u2019ll wake me up at 6 a.m. because it\u2019s on a loudspeaker,\u201d Knox said. \u201cI\u2019m Christian so when they pray in Yemeni I pray in my spiritual language.\u201d",
      "She couldn't recall exactly what drove her Black family out of Hamtramck when she was a child. Knox said she applied to join the lawsuit settlement and was selected for one of the last three houses, moving from nearby Detroit in November.",
      "\u201cI do reflect about the history,\" Knox said. \u201cI believe I was put here for a reason. I can\u2019t explain it. ... I\u2019m already 70 and just startin\u2019 all over again.\u201d",
      "Hamtramck isn't trying to cover up its past. A park honors the late Sarah Sims Garrett, the lawsuit's lead plaintiff, and a monument there describes the long struggle to overcome discrimination.",
      "Her son, Dwydell Garrett, 59, also lives in a house granted to him through the settlement. Memories of his mother inspired his return.",
      "\u201cIt's a very special honor to have someone raise me as not being bitter for things that went on,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI can't hold a grudge.\u201d",

      "A New York teen is trying to put his life back together after he was wrongly identified as a suspect in a mass shooting",
      "NEW YORK -- Camden Lee was leaving high school football practice in September when he saw the photograph, splashed across the New York Police Department\u2019s social media accounts, that would soon upend his life.",
      "In a crisp surveillance image, the 15-year-old stands alone in a hoodie and shorts, eyes cast down on a Brooklyn street. \u201cThe pictured individual,\u201d police declared in an accompanying caption, had \u201cdischarged a firearm\u201d at the West Indian American Day parade, killing one person and wounding four others.",
      "\u201cI see the NYPD logo. I see me. I see \u2018suspect wanted for murder,\u2019\u201d Lee recalled. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. Then everything went blurry.\u201d",
      "In private, police backpedaled almost immediately. After meeting with Lee and his lawyer, they declined to bring charges, then quietly removed his photograph from their X and Instagram accounts. But they have not publicly acknowledged the retraction, ignoring the repeated pleas of Lee and his mother, who say their lives remain threatened by the falsehood.",
      "The family\u2019s search for answers has raised questions about the NYPD\u2019s policies for correcting misinformation at a time when the department is already facing scrutiny for other social media misrepresentations.",
      "\u201cI used to have a lot of trust in the NYPD and how they do things,\u201d said Lee\u2019s mother, Chee Chee Brock, whose older son recently joined the force. \u201cBut I raised my kids to admit when they made a mistake. If you can blame an innocent kid for murder, what else can you get away with?\u201d",
      "The department\u2019s newly appointed chief spokesperson, Deputy Commissioner for Public Information Delaney Kempner, said she would look into the matter but did not answer a list of questions or provide further information.",
      "It remains unclear why Lee was identified as a suspect.",
      "The day of the shooting, Lee said, he left football practice and stopped at the annual Labor Day celebration of Caribbean culture with a teammate at around 1 p.m. Minutes later, as gunfire erupted along the route, his friend was grazed in the shoulder. The surveillance image, Lee said, showed his stunned expression after hearing gunshots for the first time, then watching his bloodied friend carted away on a stretcher.",
      "When police published it, on Sept. 19, Lee's mother immediately contacted an attorney, Kenneth Montgomery, who offered to set up a meeting with homicide detectives that night. But police told the lawyer to bring the teen to Brooklyn\u2019s 77th precinct station the following week. At the meeting \u2014 according to Montgomery, Lee and his mother \u2014 the detectives said he was not a suspect.",
      "\u201cThey conceded they got it wrong,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cBut these officers were so cavalier about it. It was like they were playing a game with a kid\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "By then the NYPD\u2019s communications division had widely distributed the photograph of Lee to media outlets and TV stations, which urged people to come forward with tips about the unnamed suspect.",
      "In recent weeks a high-ranking department official has urged some outlets not to use the image in follow-up stories about the shooting, according to text messages shared with The Associated Press. But those conversations with reporters were \u201coff the record,\u201d preventing news sites from explaining why the photograph was removed.",
      "In the absence of official clarification, the photo has continued to circulate online, triggering a barrage of death threats against Lee from online sleuths who tracked down his own social media accounts.",
      "As he got ready for school on a recent morning, Lee pulled up an Instagram page with 750,000 followers and scrolled through the comments below his photograph.",
      "\u201cHe about to get found quick,\u201d one read. Another said simply: \u201cHe done.\u201d Others tagged friends and family of Denzel Chan, 25, who was killed in the shooting. \u201cThey deserve answers too,\u201d Lee said of Chan's loved ones.",
      "At a news conference immediately following the shooting, NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said the violence was gang-related. He described the suspect as a slim man in his 20s who wore a paint-stained brown shirt and bandana. Lee, who turned 16 in January, wore neither in the photograph released weeks later.",
      "Fearing possible gang retaliation, Brock, a single mother who works at the post office, moved her son and two daughters to a relative\u2019s home outside the city. Lee missed weeks of school, hurting his grades, as evidenced by a report card hanging on the fridge. While the family has since returned to Brooklyn, Lee has been forbidden by his mother from moving around alone.",
      "\u201cAs a mom, the No. 1 thing I\u2019m scared of is losing my kids to the streets or the jail system,\u201d said Brock. \u201cSo he doesn\u2019t have freedom now. When he goes to the corner store, I time him.\u201d",
      "It has not escaped the family\u2019s attention that the mistaken identification came at a uniquely tumultuous time for city police. In the 17 days between the shooting and the release of the photo, federal agents seized phones from Police Commissioner Edward Caban, who then resigned, telling officers that the investigation \u201ccreated a distraction for the department.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tremendous pressure on the NYPD to serve up results in a high-profile shooting like this,\u201d said Wylie Stecklow, a civil rights attorney who is representing the family as they weigh a possible lawsuit. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019ve failed to explain how this mistake was made, and how they\u2019ll avoid it in the future, is deeply troubling.\u201d",
      "As the department seeks to rehabilitate its image, its communications strategy has also come under fire. A recent report from the city\u2019s Department of Investigation faulted certain NYPD executives for \u201cirresponsible and unprofessional\u201d use of social media and called on the department to codify its policies around deleting public posts, as other city agencies have done.",
      "In an earlier social media post, Chell, who has since been promoted to chief of department, mistakenly identified a judge he accused of letting a predator back into the community. That post, too, was deleted.",
      "In December, just when the initial wave of attention around Lee began to subside, police announced they were upping the reward for information about the shooting to $10,000. This time they did not circulate Lee's photo.",
      "But without official confirmation that Lee was no longer a suspect, many news stations and newspapers ran the old image of him anyway. It remains all over the internet, including atop some news stories.",
      "\u201cFor the photo to come out again, it brought it all back to the start,\u201d Lee said. \u201cMy mom was just thinking of letting me go on the train again.\u201d",
      "Lately, he said, he can sense people looking at him, whispering behind back, as he walks through his neighborhood or the hallways at school. He has considered cutting his hair or buying new clothes in the hopes of passing unrecognized. Some days he prefers not to leave home at all.",
      "\u201cIt takes me to a dark place,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like myself anymore. I don\u2019t have the opportunity to explain my side of the story. Everyone is so fixed on this one image of me: murderer.\u201d"

      "But he added that if the government wanted to boost growth quickly, then \"lightening the burden that the Budget loaded onto the retail sector\" should be a priority.",
      "In October's Budget, the government increased the rate of National Insurance (NI) paid by employers from April, and also reduced the threshold that employers start paying it at from \u00a39,100 to \u00a35,000. April will also see an increase in the National Living Wage.",

    "summary": "The Drax facility, which burns wood pellets, is required to report where it sources its wood from.",
    "story": [
      "A UK power station that has received billions of pounds in government subsidies has failed more than once to report it burned wood from primary forests, BBC News has found.",
      "Drax Power Station, which burns wood pellets, is required to report where it sources its wood and whether it is from natural, previously untouched forests.",
      "The company paid a \u00a325m penalty last year for misreporting this data following an investigation by the energy regulator Ofgem and now the BBC has discovered a further year of misreporting that has not been looked at by the regulator.",
      "The company did not deny misreporting its sustainability data but said it is \"focused on implementing the lessons learned\".",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in North Yorkshire, generates approximately 6% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds in subsidies from the government and bill-payers because wood-burning is classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "These are natural forests that have never been industrially logged and lock up and store significant amounts of carbon as well providing key wildlife habitats.",
      "The company says it does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging.",
      "However, public logging records show Drax still sources whole trees from primary forests that are felled by other companies in the province, despite stating in its own sustainability criteria that the company will \"avoid damage or disturbance to high carbon forests\" which \"can be defined as primary forest\".",
      "Modern industrial logging only really began in the interior of British Columbia in the 1960s, which means the areas that have been logged and replanted in recent decades are not yet mature enough for these plantations to be harvested.",
      "Nearly all the industrial logging that takes place in the interior of the province is from \"woodland of native species where there is no clearly visible indication of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed\", the wording used by Ofgem to define primary forests.",
      "Drax was required to report to Ofgem that it had sourced wood from these areas but data obtained by the BBC through environmental information requests shows the company failed to declare any wood from primary forests in the sustainability data it submitted to the regulator regarding its Canadian wood pellets for the year 2020-21.",
      "That year Drax burned just over 1.2 million tonnes of wood pellets from Canada, with a significant proportion coming from primary forests in the interior of British Columbia.",
      "The company did not respond to the BBC's questions about why it had misreported its sustainability data and whether it had misled both the government and the energy regulator over its use of wood from primary forests.",
      "Drax appears to have since reduced its reliance on Canadian wood. The company said that only around 2.5% of pellets used at its power station in 2023 came from British Columbia, predominantly from public forests that have been designated for harvesting.",
      "The company said it \"recognises the importance of sustainably sourced biomass, and we work to ensure our pellets are legally harvested and meet the strict sustainability requirements of the UK, US, and Canadian governments, as well as those of the EU.\"",
      "The UK's current biomass sustainability criteria do not prohibit whole trees from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",
      "The company added that the misreporting previously identified by Ofgem was \"technical in nature\" and \"would not have impacted the levels of ROCs [subsidies] earned\".",
      "According to Ofgem, accurate sustainability data enables the government \"to understand and monitor the extent to which both primary forests and sawlogs are used in woody biomass, which has consequences for carbon emissions and biodiversity\".",
      "Following their investigation last year and Drax's subsequent \u00a325m penalty for misreporting data, the regulator Ofgem said it \"won't hesitate to act\" in the event of further wrong-doing.",
      "However, when approached by the BBC the regulator did not commit to any specific action relating to the further misreporting uncovered by the BBC.",
      "In a statement an Ofgem spokesperson said: \"We thank the BBC for sharing this information which relates to the same issue that was identified in our investigation into Drax.\"",
      "They added that Ofgem is making Drax \"conduct a full independent, external audit of its global supply chain profiling data to satisfy us appropriate processes and controls are in place for the future\" and added: \"If any additional evidence comes to light following the audit, we will investigate again.\"",
      "Drax's current renewable subsidies schemes come to an end in 2027 and the BBC's discovery of further misreporting of sustainability data by Drax comes as the government is expected to announce an extension of Drax's subsidies imminently.",
      "The government says it is carefully considering amending the current biomass sustainability criteria and will issue an update shortly but did not confirm whether it will prevent wood from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \"The situation we inherited for large scale biomass generators was unacceptable.",

      "Mr Boutflour had been interested in space and aviation from a young age, mentioning Concorde as an early inspiration.",
      "A course at Portsmouth University caught his imagination - the UK's first Space Systems Degree Apprenticeship launched in conjunction with BAE Systems.",
      "To build up funds to help pay for the course, he switched to lorry driving - a move which did not prepare his social circle for his change of direction.",
      "\"Everybody thought I was lying when I said I'd been accepted on this course. They thought I was pulling their leg, going from truck driver to space engineer!\"",
      "The four-and-a-half year course involves on-the-job learning at sites where BAE Systems designs and assembles satellites.",
      "Back at Portsmouth they'll be studying space systems engineering.",
      "The academic side of the course consists of four modules, in thermodynamics, programming, digital systems and maths, all split between lectures and laboratory time.",
      "Mr Boutflour is joined by four others on the paid apprenticeship.",
      "One of those is Alice Overend.",
      "Aged 21, she had already worked on satellite assembly and testing when she applied for the Portsmouth course.",
      "This work involved the ill-fated Prometheus 2 satellites that were lost during a failed attempt to launch a satellite into space by Virgin Orbit in 2023.",
      "This incident made a deep impression on her. \"It was quite surreal, we were all watching the launch in the office and when the coverage ended we just went home.\"",
      "Unsuccessful satellite launches are part of life in the space business. But the Virgin Orbit loss stuck in the mind of other Portsmouth students. It stands for the risk element in space work.",
      "Ms Overend's background in satellite testing has given her a head-start in terms of understanding how a sprawling UK space industry fits together. \"The whole space sector is going in a good direction.\"",
      "She explains the true meaning of \"space systems\" in her world.",
      "\"Systems is about making sure everything is where it should be, such as the satellite weight being precisely right.\"",
      "George Smith is the youngest of the group at 18, and joined the course straight from A levels in physics, maths and engineering.",
      "In his home town of York he and some friends took apart an old lawn mower to build a go-kart out of the parts.",
      "How did the go-kart perform? \"It only wanted to turn to the right, but we learnt a lot about why it wasn't working.\"",
      "Not everything in space exploration goes to plan either, but practical work like this is an integral part of the course.",
      "\"The apprenticeship appealed to me. I find studying and applying the lesson in practice means I learn better. So I was looking at degree apprenticeships and this course was a checklist of everything I wanted to do.\"",
      "Space is an expanding sector and he harbours a desire to get beyond earth's atmosphere one day \"if I can tick all the right boxes to become an astronaut\".",
      "Right now the course is meeting his expectations. \"To say it's a dream come true is cheesy, but I've got in the door.\"",
      "Elizabeth Seward is the head of space strategy at BAE Systems.",
      "Despite her own background as a physicist, Ms Seward thinks people are put off this sector by a perception that it's exclusively for rocket scientists.",
      "\"Space tends to get put on a pedestal. But the truth is we need more people from other backgrounds. A career here is for anyone interested in space, such as project managers or lawyers.\"",
      "The appeal of space is evident at Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University, where Dr Stephanie Docherty teaches orbital mechanics, how a satellite gets on the right path, as part of the aerospace course.",
      "She agrees that specialisation is less important than aptitude in the space sector. \"Employers want a problem solving mind-set. And I have noticed a real appetite from students for more space content in their course.\"",
      "Proposals to build rocket-launching sites in remote locations such as the Shetland Islands mean more positions should open up in the UK space industry in the very near future.",
      "After the grounding of the Space Shuttle in 2011 Mr Boutfleur felt space exploration \"took a step backwards.\"",

      "All three students agree that the hands-on side of the course is inspiring.",
      "And outside of the space syllabus what do they get up to?",
      "\"Most of us play video games,\" says Mr Smith, with Ms Overend nodding in agreement.",

    "story": [
      "A government decision to scrap tariffs on Chinese e-bikes coming into the UK has been described as a \"kick in the teeth for British manufacturing\".",
      "Border taxes were imposed on Chinese e-bikes following Brexit, keeping the UK in line with the EU, but the Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has accepted a recommendation to lift them on non-folding e-bikes from Friday.",
      "The Trade Remedies Authority, the body responsible for reviewing tariffs, said the move allowing cheaper Chinese imports could save consumers \u00a3200.",
      "But UK-based companies have called the decision \"strange\" saying it's a blow at a \"very scary time\" for the industry.",
      "British based e-bike companies expressed concerns about the impact of a potential \"flood\" of cheap Chinese e-bikes entering the UK.",
      "James Metcalfe and his brother Lyle run e-bike company Volt and have a factory in Milton Keynes.",
      "They previously manufactured their bikes in China, before moving operations to a factory in Poland, and then shifting manufacturing to the UK following Brexit.",
      "\"I think this is an odd decision, and a kick in the teeth for UK manufacturing,\" Metcalfe told the BBC.",
      "\"We brought our manufacturing here with assurances that this [tariffs on Chinese bikes] was a long term change. We've invested a lot in it. We're a small business, family-owned, and trying to do the right thing by building a quality product,\" he said.",
      "The UK was already a very competitively priced market for bikes, with little need to bring in cheaper bikes from China, he added.",
      "\"What's the benefit? I don't see any. The government are saying there'll be savings for the UK consumer, but for years we've been pushing government to put through alternative savings like grants and subsidies for customers.\"",
      "\"Why not do what everyone else has done across Europe? Provide grants and invest in bike infrastructure in the UK,\" he added.",
      "Metcalfe also questioned why tariffs for folding e-bikes from China remained in place.",
      "\"I'm all for protecting the whole industry and I find it odd that they're protecting one small part of it,\" he said.",
      "On Thursday, the government said it had accepted a recommendation from the Trade Remedies Authority to revoke anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese e-bikes of between 10.3% and 70.1%, and taxes designed to counteract subsidies of 3.9% to 17.2%.",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Defending UK industry from unfair competition is important, which is why we've taken the decision to continue protecting UK folding e-bike producers based in the UK, whilst also lowering prices for consumers and importers of other products.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that the government was \"continuing to take action on unsafe e-bikes\" and had recently launched a campaign \"to raise awareness of the risks of dangerous e-bike batteries and scooters\".",
      "'A scary time for the industry'",
      "The UK bike industry has endured a tough few years following a boom during the Covid pandemic, which saw an increase in outdoor exercise and many people choosing cycling over public transport.",
      "Post-Covid sales dropped dramatically, and many companies were left with stock they struggled to shift. A number of companies struggled, including Mercian and Orange Mountain Bikes, or ceased production, such as Islabikes.",
      "David Miall, who runs e-bike company Wisper Bikes, said UK firms had been heavily discounting in recent years to try and attract new customers.",
      "He said the latest move by the government, which he described as a \"very strange decision\", would bring a \"flood\" of cheaper Chinese imports to an already overstocked market.",
      "\"It's a very scary time for the industry right now, and this will cause a lot of trouble for a lot of companies,\" he said.",
      "David's company designs its bikes in the UK, but manufactures them in Taiwan and Portugal.",
      "He said he had already been contacted by Chinese bike manufacturers offering very low prices for their products.",
      "\"They've overstocked too, and they now see the UK as a place to dump their bikes,\" he said, adding that he may now consider focusing solely on fold up e-bikes.",
      "\"I think the government are thinking 'Let's give e-bikes a boost' but this has been badly thought-through by people who don't understand the industry,\" he said.",
      "The Bicycle Association, which represents firms who make and sell standard and fold up bikes, said it was helping its members to respond to the new rules.",
      "\"This is a significant decision and it may take some time for the implications for the UK cycle industry and its supply chains to become clear,\" a spokesman said.",
      "\"We have for example already requested official clarification of the precise definition which HMRC will be using to identify 'folding e-bikes', which are still subject to these measures.\"",
      "What is an e-bike?",
      "Electric bikes - or 'e-bikes' - are an increasingly popular way to get around for hundreds of thousands of people in the UK.",
      "The broad term 'e-bike' is commonly used for any electric-powered bike, but it can actually refer to very different types of equipment which are covered by different laws.",
      "When most people think of an e-bike, they picture what is essentially a normal push bicycle with a small chargeable motor fitted to make it easier for the user to turn the pedals.",
      "But there are also far more powerful electric-powered bikes on the market which are sometimes lumped in with e-bikes - for example, some models can hit 60mph and are designed for off-road riding in rugged terrain.",

      "It wasn't the first time the businessman had sought out Japanese buyers or lenders for his projects.",
      "In the cut-throat world of New York real estate, Trump had a front-row seat from his Fifth Avenue skyscraper of Tokyo's buying spree in the 80s of iconic US brands and properties, including Rockefeller Center.",
      "It was then that his worldview on trade and America's relations with its allies was formed, and his fixation on tariffs, a tax on imports, began.",
      "\"He had a tremendous resentment for Japan,\" says Barbara Res, a former executive vice-president at the Trump Organization.",

      "\"I'm tired of watching other countries ripping off the United States.\"",
      "That Trump quote could've been pulled from 2016, but it's actually from the late 80s when he made an appearance on CNN's Larry King Live, around the time he first floated his name as a potential presidential candidate.",
      "Fresh from sharing his business philosophy in his 1987 book, The Art of the Deal, Trump went on a tirade against America's trade policies in national interviews.",
      "In an animated interview with Oprah Winfrey before a live studio audience on The Oprah Show, he said he would handle foreign policy differently by making the country's allies \"pay their fair share\".",
      "He added that there wasn't free trade when Japan was \"dumping\" products into America's market but making it \"impossible to do business\" there.",

      "Japan provided competition for US manufacturing, particularly in consumer electronics and cars. As US factories were shuttering and new Japanese brands entered the market, pundits were talking about Japan surpassing the US as the world's leading economy.",
      "\"Trump is sort of symbolic of a lot of people who were kind of questioning American leadership in the American-led international order, and whether it actually served the United States,\" Prof Miller says.",
      "Before his Oprah appearance, Trump had spent almost $100,000 to release an \"open letter\" in full-page ads in three major US newspapers.",

      "The ad served as a potent introduction to Trump's foreign policy vision, according to Prof Miller. One built on the zero-sum belief that allies are freeloaders and that the liberal internationalist approach which had dominated since World War II was weak and foolish in a competitive world. The solution, he argued, was a more aggressive, protectionist trade policy.",

A longtime critic of free-trade policies, he said nobody who was intellectually serious was affiliated with Trump or his simplistic approach at the time.

And in fairness to him, you know that is a very natural way to view international commerce,\" said Michael Strain, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute.",

      "The sticking points remain that his views that foreign imports are bad, that the size of the trade deficit is a useful measure of policy success or that the ideal state for the US economy is to only import goods that cannot physically be made in the US.",
      "Mr Strain believes threats to increase tariffs on US allies could reduce business investment and weaken international alliances.",
      "Joseph LaVorgna, a chief economist of the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, believes there's been too narrow a focus on tariffs and not enough of an attempt to understand the big picture of what Trump is trying to accomplish.",
      "He says the president wants to galvanise domestic industry, in particular high-tech manufacturing.",
      "The administration, he explains, feels they can encourage more corporations to come to the US using tariffs, combined with deregulation, cheaper energy and lower corporate taxes, if enacted by Congress.",
      "\"I think that President Trump understands something which is very important, being a businessman and being transactional, and that is free trade is great in theory but in the real world you need to have fair trade and that's a level playing field.\"",
      "He is betting Donald Trump is right. Few Republicans have publicly opposed the president as he demands loyalty to his agenda.",

      "The chaos left many in the US wondering about the fate of packages ordered from companies such as Shein and Temu, which had used the exemption for low-value packages to expand rapidly in the US.",

      "The move comes as some of the other rapid-fire changes Trump has announced since taking office last month have also met with roadblocks, including legal challenges.",
      "Last weekend he said he was putting 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, before rapidly suspending those duties for a month to allow talks to continue.",
      "On Friday, Trump said he expected to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on many countries next week, a plan he had outlined on the campaign trail by which the US would levy tariffs at the same rates that other countries apply to the equivalent products made in the US.",
      "The US had started to re-examine the exemption for low-value packages, known as de minimis, before Trump entered office.",
      "The Biden administration in September proposed to tighten the rules on such packages from China, saying the move would help US firms compete and address challenges blocking shipments of illicit drugs.",
      "In 2016, the US had raised the threshold for exemption from tariffs and other fees from $200 to $800 to facilitate trade and allow officials to focus on higher priority shipments.",
      "But that decision has faced criticism as e-commerce has rapidly expanded and the number of packages entering the US under the $800 limit surged from 140 million to more than 1.3 billion last year."

      "Three former Harrods employees have accused Mohamed Al Fayed's only surviving brother of sexually assaulting them while they were working for the department store.",
      "Speaking publicly for the first time, the women say Ali Fayed, 82, assaulted them in the 1990s when he and his brothers, Mohamed and Salah, owned and ran Harrods.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr Fayed, who lives in the US, said the businessman \"will not be scapegoated\" and he \"unequivocally denies any and all the allegations of wrongdoing\" and that \"the incidents simply never took place\".",
      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual violence",
      "The alleged sexual assaults happened in London, Scotland, Switzerland and the United States. One of the women, a former interior designer for Harrods, says one assault happened on a work trip while she was staying with Ali Fayed and his family at their former home in Connecticut.",
      "\"His hands were everywhere,\" she says, and he stopped because \"one of his little boys started calling for him\".",
      "All three women say prior to Ali Fayed's alleged assaults, they had also been sexually abused by his older brother. Police say 111 women have now made allegations against Mohamed Al Fayed, who added the Arabic \"Al\" prefix to his surname sometime in the 1970s.",
      "One of the women, Amy, has told the BBC she wants \"an explanation\" from Ali Fayed, and an \"understanding of what was going on that can help [her] step forward and begin healing\".",

      "\"This is my chance to finally stand up for myself. I'm not going to be that scared 24-year-old who doesn't know what to do,\" says Frances - who, like Amy, has waived her right to anonymity.",
      "Frances took a job working for Harrods in the store's interior design studio in 1989.",
      "It wasn't long before Mohamed Al Fayed began to bully and sexually abuse her, she says. Frances says she recalls him regularly trying to grab her breasts and grope her while at work, or subjecting her to \"foul\" verbal tirades.",
      "Despite not having much experience, Frances says she was tasked with renovating Mohamed Al Fayed's sprawling Scottish Balnagown Estate, including a farmhouse belonging to his younger brother, Ali.",
      "Frances describes Ali Fayed's demeanour as calmer than that of Mohamed.",
      "\"I think for a moment I thought maybe he would be kinder to me,\" she says. \"But he wasn't.\"",
      "Ali Fayed, like Mohamed, also had a private office and private apartment in 60 Park Lane in central London.",
      "It was in Ali's office where Frances says his sexual abuse started with him \"trying to kiss\" her, followed by him \"groping\" and \"molesting\" her.",
      "She says both the Fayed brothers would regularly give her gifts. \"With Mohamed, it would often be wads of cash, Ali would give jewellery or clothes. It would be a see-saw between abusive behaviour then praise for my work and these lavish items.\"",
      "The abuse escalated in 1992, she says, when she flew to Connecticut to discuss interior design plans with Ali Fayed's wife.",
      "\"It was this huge private house and it was decorated in an English country house style. I don't think I'd ever seen anything like it in my life,\" says Frances.",
      "\"I remember his wife taking me into this picture-perfect American rich town.\"",
      "Frances says she was staying in a guest room at the family's house when Ali Fayed told her to get changed for dinner one evening.",
      "\"I was in the bathroom and got undressed. When I came out in my underwear, he [Ali] was just standing there in the room. I hadn't heard him come in or knock.\"",
      "Frances says Ali Fayed got her on the bed and tried to get on top of her. His hands were \"inside my bra, inside my pants. I knew what his intention was\".",
      "According to Frances the alleged attack stopped when one of Ali's children called out for him. Afterwards, she says she sat on the bed, \"frozen\".",
      "A spokesperson for Ali Fayed said the businessman \"is not a perpetrator\" and will \"robustly defend himself against these unsubstantiated claims\".",
      "When Frances returned to work in London, she says Mohamed Al Fayed \"exploded\" and started \"aggressively spitting abusive words\" because he apparently believed she and Ali had had sex .",
      "She says he told her: \"I'm done with you\u2026 go be with my brother.\"",
      "\"From that point, I'd still see Mohamed, and he'd still call me every name under the sun, but he didn't actually physically abuse me,\" says Frances.",
      "\"Now I was in fear of two of the owners and I knew if I spoke out it would get worse. I could be threatened, I could be fired. I just felt I had to keep on going and, at some point, this horror would pass.\"",
      "'I remember him laughing'",
      "Frances says Ali Fayed sexually assaulted her again later that year on a trip to Balnagown, where she was adding the finishing interior touches to his farmhouse.",
      "Ali called her into his private office, she says, then dragged her onto his lap and started kissing her neck and touching her breasts as he spun around in his chair.",
      "She says she could feel he was aroused through his trousers.",
      "\"I remember him laughing,\" recalls Frances, who says she eventually managed to break free and run out of the room. \"Laughter is meant to be nice. It wasn't. I left him there just laughing at me.\"",
      "Ali Fayed would often try to sexually touch her when they met, she says, \"always laughing and joking and making out it was fun\".",
      "The following year, Frances says she was fired for being in a relationship with another employee, something she says Mohamed Al Fayed forbade among staff. Harrods later settled a case she brought for unfair dismissal.",
      "Frances describes her time after leaving Harrods as \"going underground and shutting myself down\". She struggled to work and trust people and eventually moved away. She says Mohamed and Ali Fayed \"took away\" her confidence and dignity.",
      "\"To this day I suffer with terrible anxiety and panic attacks and I don't like people in my space,\" she says.",
      "Mohamed Al Fayed and his younger brothers bought Harrods in 1985. While Mohamed was the chairman, running day-to-day operations of the luxury department store, Ali Fayed was a director and also helped oversee the House of Fraser group, which they owned in the early 1990s.",
      "The new claims point to the \"breadth of abuse\" by Mohamed Al Fayed and \"raise serious allegations\" against his brother Ali, Harrods told the BBC in a statement.",
      "\"We could not possibly speak on behalf of any individual who can, and should, respond to these allegations directly,\" it added.",
      "The store, which came under new ownership in 2010, said it hoped survivors were looking at \"every appropriate avenue to them in their pursuit of justice, whether that be Harrods, the police or the Fayed family and estate\".",
      "Ali Fayed, who was granted British citizenship in 1999, co-owns luxury British shirtmaker Turnbull and Asser with his sons - but resigned as director on 8 December 2024, 10 days after these allegations were put to him by the BBC.",
      "All three women alleging abuse by Ali Fayed initially spoke to filmmaker Keaton Stone, who has been investigating Mohamed Al Fayed since 2018 and whose work informed the BBC's recent documentary and podcast about Mohamed's predatory behaviour.",
      "Mohamed Al Fayed never faced charges while he was alive, but the women believe his brother Ali should now be investigated by police.",
      "\"Whether any charges would be brought, I don't know, but I believe he should be investigated for what he did,\" says Amy.",
      "She worked as a personal assistant to Mohamed Al Fayed for almost three years, and says he sexually abused her throughout her time at Harrods. The abuse escalated, Amy says, when Mohamed let himself into her room on a work trip to Paris and tried to rape her.",
      "She says she \"endured\" the abuse, thinking \"that was just what being a young woman meant, it was a hazard of the workplace\".",
      "Amy says she remembers Ali Fayed coming into Mohamed's Park Lane office - and also taking phone calls from him. \"He gave me the nickname 'Amy speaking' which he thought was hilarious,\" she recalls. \"He would giggle when he spoke to me.\"",
      "A year or two into the job, Amy says Mohamed told her to go to Switzerland with Ali to help with some personal assistant duties like filing and paperwork.",
      "The pair travelled together on a Harrods private jet, she says, and were driven to the upmarket resort of Gstaad, where the Fayed family owned a ski chalet.",
      "\"Once we got to the chalet, aside from the elderly housekeeper, it was myself and Ali alone for three days. It was strange,\" says Amy. \"No efforts were made to even create something for me to do.\"",
      "The trip was taken out of season and Amy says Ali Fayed seemed bored. He suggested they go to the local public swimming pool, she says, and when they got there it was deserted.",
      "\"That's when Ali's demeanour changed and he became giddy,\" says Amy.",
      "\"He pulled me in under the water, and groped and fondled me, making me feel very, very uncomfortable - very much trapped. I was terrified thinking how am I going to get out of this.\"",
      "Amy says Ali Fayed laughed as he \"groped\" her, before she managed to break free of his clutches.",
      "After the alleged assault, Amy says they both returned to the chalet and she was left alone for the rest of the evening, feeling isolated and afraid.",
      "Like the other two women, Amy didn't tell anyone about the alleged abuse by either of the brothers.",
      "Amy says she didn't want to upset her loved ones and didn't necessarily feel people would believe her.",
      "\"By not saying anything, I think it's a coping technique, to just put it away,\" she adds.",
      "Amy went back to work after the alleged assault took place in Gstaad, but eventually resigned.",
      "She says she \"escaped and ran away\" to work abroad.",
      "\"I wanted to just remove myself from it all\", she says, but \"the trauma\" lived with her.",
      "\"To this day, in certain social situations, I don't want to be noticed, I try to stay invisible,\" she says.",
      "Ali Fayed denies all the allegations of wrongdoing - said his spokesperson - and \"will not allow false accusations to go unchallenged\".",
      "A third woman, who we are calling Laura, told us she recalls Mohamed Al Fayed summoning her to his office and telling her \"with a smirk on his face\" that his brother Ali wanted to see her.",

      "Al Fayed's brother Salah also abused us, women say",
      "Police investigate more people over Al Fayed abuse",
      "Laura had been working directly for Mohamed Al Fayed in Harrods' HR department and says his sexual harassment towards her had become commonplace, escalating to two serious sexual assaults.",
      "Laura says Mohamed sent her to their office building in Park Lane one evening, but when she arrived there was no work to be done. She says she was sent through to Ali Fayed's apartment where he was waiting. Laura says he told her they would be having dinner, and then presented her with a bottle of wine from the year she was born and a necklace.",
      "\"I wondered how he knew things about me,\" she says.",
      "Alone in his apartment, Laura says Ali Fayed ordered her through to the bedroom where she says she was subjected to a serious sexual assault. She says she felt \"numbed with fear\" and had to do whatever she was told in order to \"get out of there\".",
      "\"Afterwards he just told me I could go.\"",
      "Laura says she never saw Ali Fayed again but kept the necklace from that night and it has recently been valued at \u00a36,500.",
      "The abuse at Harrods \"took its toll\" says Laura - even after she left the store. She bottled it all up for 25 years, she says, and still hasn't told some of her loved ones what she went through.",
      "All three women are pursuing civil legal action against Harrods through Justice for Harrods Survivors.",
      "\"We applaud the bravery of the women who have spoken out on their allegations against Ali Fayed and reiterate our commitment to securing justice and accountability for all survivors,\" says their barrister Maria Mulla.",
      "\"We repeat, no stone will be left unturned in pursuit of this aim.\"",
      "The BBC spoke to three other women who said they had been either raped, sexually assaulted or trafficked by the other Fayed brother, Salah, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2010.",
      "The women who accuse Ali Fayed question what the three brothers knew about each other's behaviour.",
      "\"Looking back now, maybe they found it amusing to see how far the boundaries were with us between the brothers,\" says Amy. \"Maybe there was competition. I really don't know, but I do feel it was all amusing for them.\"",
      "Ali Fayed's spokesperson says he \"unequivocally denies any and all allegations of wrongdoing. The alleged incidents simply never occurred.

      "The government has made growing the economy one of its key aims. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC he was \"not satisfied with growth\" and the downgraded forecast \"just spurs us on\".",
      "The new forecast came as the Bank cut interest rates to 4.5% from 4.75%. Its governor, Andrew Bailey, said that rates remain on a downward path.",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "Low growth and rising prices - it's looking gloomy for the UK",

      "After the rates announcement, the pound slumped, before regaining ground.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bailey stressed that the Bank needs to remain \"gradual and careful\" when continuing to cut rates because \"there is a lot more uncertainty\" and because of the predicted rise in inflation.",
      "While it cut its growth forecast for this year, the Bank upgraded its predictions for both 2026 and 2027. The economy is now expected to grow by 1.5% in both of those years, the Bank said, up from 1.25%.",
      "However, it also predicted that higher energy and water bills would push up inflation \"quite sharply\" later this year, and warned there were a number of factors that could affect inflation including possible trade tariffs in the US.",
      "Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is now expected to rise to 3.7% and take until the end of 2027 to fall back to its 2% target.",
      "Last week, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a number of measures to try to boost the UK economy.",
      "However, her decision in last year's Budget to increase employers' National Insurance contributions from April has led to a wave of criticism from businesses, who argue it will push up prices and hit investment and jobs.",
      "Mr Bailey said the impact of the Budget, particularly the looming higher costs of employing people, was feeding through into lower confidence for businesses and households.",

      "The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused.",
      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",

      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",
      "\"These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. \"They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it].\"",
      "He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation.",
      "But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive.",
      "\"There's a massive brain drain,\" he says. \"My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation.\"",
      "He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West.",
      "Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate.",
      "\"I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast.",

      "Vlad's father, Graham Caisley, describes how their son must have staggered upstairs, before collapsing on his bedroom floor.",
      "\"His hands were all clenched up and he was shaking,\" Graham says. \"It was just a state of panic.\"",
      "\"It was violent, it was sudden,\" his mother adds, as she describes her son suffering multiple seizures. \"Fitting and fighting for life - I can't even start imagining the terror he went through.\"",

      "\"He's researched and understood, and been told where to buy these things and what to buy,\" says DS Chris Barrow from Hampshire Police. \"So, without the website, Vlad wouldn't have been able to put together this set of items and ingredients with which to take his own life.\"",
      "After a happy childhood, Vlad had begun to withdraw in his early teens and was later diagnosed with autism, depression and anxiety. At the time of his death he was being treated by mental health professionals and had also developed a painful neurological condition.",

      "Your 20s are a whirlwind of bad dates, career crises, and wondering if you'll ever really get your life together.",
      "Enter Bridget Jones, the queen of chaotic charm, who has been stumbling through life lessons since before many of us can remember.",
      "Despite the original Bridget Jones's Diary book being released in 1996 and the film in 2001, it seems the floundering and flawed heroine has captivated the hearts of Gen Z, who weren't born when Helen Fielding's novel was first published.",
      "Fielding says she finds it \"comforting\" that women in their 20s have a real interest in Bridget\u2019s trials and tribulations. At her book signings, she says \"half the audience are Gen Zs\".",
      "From navigating embarrassing work mishaps to realising that self love (and maybe an extra glass of Chardonnay) is the key to happiness, Bridget has been there, done that, and lived to tell the tale.",
      "Ahead of the release of the new film Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy next week, we've been speaking to three women in their 20s about the life lessons the character taught them: Sophie Gwillym from Cardiff, 28, Hannah Booth in Chester, 25, and 27-year-old Sophie Tyler from Yorkshire.",
      "And then there's us - Yasmin and Noor - both fans of the franchise who have a lot to say about it.",
      "When did you discover Bridget Jones?",
      "Yasmin: In the summer before high school, I stole a tattered copy of Bridget Jones's Diary from my parents' bookshelf and read it all in one night hidden under my duvet. To me, it was a bible for adult life, which, being on the edge of puberty and going into year seven, felt like a total must-read. Almost all of it went over my head at that age but one thing stuck with me: Bridget Jones felt like a real woman who, unlike other perfect heroines that featured in many stories that were actually aimed at children, was flawed and nuanced.",
      "Noor: I was at school and I remember my English teacher talking about one of the films. She was refusing to go see it, as she felt the whole premise was completely unrealistic (\"As if such a beautiful, competent woman would be struggling to find love\"). But my older sister was going, so I tagged along and it was love at first sight plus I'll admit I fancied Hugh Grant just a bit.",
      "Sophie T: My best friend and I watched the first film at a sleepover when we were about 14. I think, on reflection, the scene where Bridget sleeps with Hugh Grant\u2019s character, Daniel Cleaver, for the first time probably wasn't appropriate for us...  I do remember thinking she shouldn't have worn the big knickers (but I would've had no idea why), and we giggled through all the adult bits.",
      "What can a 1990s icon teach someone in their 20s about love today?",
      "Noor: Bridget Jones's obsession with Daniel Cleaver was my life in my 20s. I was chasing after bad boys and addicted to the drama, so it was completely relatable. My friends and I were in endless casual relationships \u2013 and that's very Bridget too. Her dating life was the definition of the situationship, before that was even a thing. But what I really like is how she (eventually) realises she deserves better. She teaches us you can find a Mr Darcy who loves you \"just as you are\" \u2013 even if he does wear reindeer jumpers and fold his pants before bed.",
      "Yasmin: Bridget has given us the ultimate guide to getting over a heartbreak: lying on the sofa wearing old pyjamas and eating ice cream out of the tub while you sob to All By Myself. Unlike the Bridget of the early films, today's 20-somethings aren't incessantly checking for answerphone messages but we are guilty of a bit of post-breakup stalking. Even if the tech isn't the same, early Bridget's neurotic tendencies can still teach us that obsessing over someone is rarely worth it.",
      "Sophie G: Bridget isn't a perfect character, and that's OK. You should be loved for who you are and not try to change yourself to fit in with what society thinks you should be - but learning to accept that is a hard task.",
      "Hannah: At first, Bridget is the epitome of a woman who thinks she needs a man to survive but by the end of the first film, she teaches us to value nice, respectful guys and not to tolerate people who cheat (though, admittedly, they shouldn't have made Daniel Cleaver so hot!).",
      "She also teaches us how to work at a relationship, that love is a choice as well as a feeling, and how to be vulnerable and have boundaries at the same time.",
      "What does Bridget's character mean to you?",
      "Sophie T: It comes back to not needing to change yourself in a society that pressurises us constantly to be skinnier, taller, to read more books and be the best at hobbies. Having a character with self-acceptance is so important when we are constantly being pressured to change ourselves.",
      "Yasmin: I love that Bridget embraces her chaotic energy and that really appeals to Gen Z. If she was a woman in her 20s now, she'd definitely have fallen madly in love with the concept of brat summer - instead of Chaka Khan, she'd be blaring out Charli XCX's 365 through her headphones on her morning commute.",
      "Noor: Wear the big knickers. Eating the entire contents of your fridge is OK sometimes. And don't be defeated by a bad hair day!",
      "But, isn't the series a bit problematic for 2025?",
      "Yasmin: Bridget is by no means perfect - her calorie counting obsession feels dated and other characters branding a woman who weighs 60kg fat is jarring. Body positivity may be more celebrated now - in fact, some women would love \"a bottom the size of two bowling balls\" - but being self-conscious about your appearance is a universal feeling that transcends decades.",
      "One thing I will say is that it's hard to feel too sorry for Bridget when she owns her own flat in central London, has a successful publishing and journalism career and doesn't seem to worry about the price of a round of drinks at the pub - it all feels a little less realistic now.",
      "Noor: You could definitely argue the earlier books and films haven't aged well. First of all, there's a noticeable lack of diversity, and way too many sexist jokes. Then you chuck in all that obsessing over being single, and Bridget's fretting over her calorie intake.",
      "Much of that feels out of place in the context of the progress we've made now, but that's not to say it no longer has relevance: one of my friends is considering Ozempic and others still worry about why they've not met their dream partner as they swipe through Tinder and Bumble.",
      "Sophie G: I think if Bridget was created now, some of those more \"problematic\" elements of her character might be changed but that would be a shame, as it's part of her charm.",
      "We all say and do things we kick ourselves for later. And most of Bridget's more problematic moments are the result of pressures women are subjected to in our society. The way Bridget acts feels more realistic than some characters who are the perfect feminist who deals with everything in the best way.",
      "What have you learnt through Bridget about the importance of friendships?",
      "Noor: I don't think I could've got through the numerous crises of my 20s without having a close group of female friends around me, as Bridget does. Nowadays, there are probably fewer Friday pub trips after work, and more meeting up for yoga and spin, but the overall message is the same: choose your friends wisely as they're the ones who will be there when everything else goes wrong.",
      "Sophie T: That friendship will always be there through the ups and downs of romantic life: to laugh at the failures and be there to comfort you when you need it. Bridget's interactions with her friends are the same as mine. We're always catching up over a meal and drink to moan about life - though there's a little less smoking these days.",
      "Yasmin: Find yourself friends that will eat your blue celery soup! Instead of going for drinks at a fancy London bar and getting a black cab home, we often split a bottle of cheap Tesco wine at one of our crammed and crumbly flats. But really, it doesn't matter what you're doing, it's just about having a supportive group of friends who can tell you when it's time to ditch your toxic Daniel Cleaver-esque situationship.",
      "What did Bridget teach you about your career?",
      "Sophie T: Whenever I'm in a work situation where I'm meeting new people, I genuinely always picture the scene from the film where Bridget's trying to introduce people to each other with a fact about the other person and messes it up.",
      "The iconic scene when she tells her boss Daniel she's quitting has also always stuck with me. During times when I've had to deal with sexism in my career and have battled it head on, I'd like to imagine R-E-S-P-E-C-T was playing in the background.",
      "Noor: Don't send emails before proof reading, don't try and use language you don't understand. Oh, and don't sleep with your boss.",
      "Sophie G: It's okay to try something new and put yourself out there, regardless of your age or where you think you should be in your career at a certain point. Bridget's fear of public speaking has definitely resonated with me in the past, but knowing I'll never have to present in front of Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Salmon Rushdie is a comforting thought.",
      "Hannah: To be ambitious and aspirational. A successful career is important to a sense of purpose. You can make mistakes and work through them and you can make bold decisions and take risks.",

      "The CNN interview",
      "Gasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.",
      "But she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.",
      "It has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".",
      "The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.",
      "Often, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.",
      "Pulling out of events",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the next week or so.",
      "These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.",
      "However, the actress is now not expected to appear at any of them, as the turmoil continues.",
      "And that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.",
      "The publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".",

      "Many film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies.",
      "This sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.",
      "For example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.",
      "Traditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.",
      "However, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.",
      "Despite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy.",
      "Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.",
      "How could this impact Gasc\u00f3n's co-stars",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.",
      "It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "It was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.",
      "\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"",
      "Then, on Sunday, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".",
      "Oscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.",
      "Meanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".",
      "\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.",
      "\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust.",
      "\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"",
      "As for Emilia P\u00e9rez as a whole, the controversy could make its chances of a best picture win far less likely, particularly in a year where there is no breakout frontrunner for best picture.",

    "story": [
      "Amandaland, the new BBC series which is a spin-off from the popular sitcom Motherland, has received a rapturous response from critics.",
      "The show sees Lucy Punch reprise her role as Amanda, the overbearing and competitive mother who was a viewer favourite in the original series.",
      "The Independent said the new spin-off \"will make you howl with laughter\", adding that English actress Punch \"has never been better\".",
      "The Telegraph described it as being \"both hilarious and heartfelt\", adding that lead actress Punch and co-star Dame Joanna Lumley \"make a dream comic double act\".",
      "In the show, the recently divorced Amanda must navigate parenting teenagers in her new surroundings, after having downsized, swapping Waitrose in Chiswick for Tesco Metro in South Harlesden.",
      "\"Spin-offs are always a risk, but Lucy Punch's Amanda was a sure bet,\" wrote the Guardian's Chitra Ramaswamy in a four-star review.",
      "\"Sorry, team Liz, but she was the best character in Motherland: the ideal [writer] Sharon-Horgan-sharpened instrument for impaling the worst excesses, blind spots and hypocrisies of the posh, white, west London middle classes.\"",
      "She added: \"There's lots to love... When the writing is this good, it fizzes with the hysterical energy of perimenopause.\"",
      "Ramaswamy singled out one line of dialogue where Amanda reflects: \"I'm actually glad I took the kids out of private school. They've got way more chance of getting into Oxbridge from a bog-standard state.\"",
      "'Ab Fab levels of relish'",
      "The \"narcissism-powered dynamic\" between Amanda and her mother, Felicity, is, the critic noted, \"played with Ab Fab levels of relish by Joanna Lumley\".",
      "The long-suffering Anne (Philippa Dunne) also returns for the spin-off, and there are new characters, such as Amanda's downstairs neighbour Mal (Samuel Anderson), celebrity chef Della Fry (Derry Girls actress Siobhan McSweeney) and her uber liberal wife Fi (Rochenda Sandall).",
      "The new show was created and written by the same team that came up with Bafta-winning comedy series Motherland; Holly Walsh, Helen Serafinowicz and Barunka O'Shaughnessy, with Horgan credited as creator.",
      "Motherland was reportedly axed after its 2022 Christmas special. For its follow-up, the Independent's Charlotte O'Sullivan noted: \"Arguably, lessons have been learnt.",
      "\"Where the final festive episode [of Motherland] was bracingly bleak, Amandaland (written by roughly the same team, plus Horrible Histories's Laurence Rickard) has a cosier, more romcom-ish vibe.\"",
      "In her four-star review, O'Sullivan said the story of \"Punch's posh alpha mum, is clever, jolly and hard to resist\".",
      "\"Even in Motherland, Amanda had angst,\" she said. \"In the new show, as you'd expect, there's more time to explore her loneliness and self-doubt. What is Amanda good for? The answer is frequently absolutely nothing. But we root for this absurd and vulnerable woman all the same.",
      "\"Richard Curtis [the Notting Hill and Love Actually film-maker] minimised the realities of gentrification to an outrageous degree,\" she continued. \"Amandaland, by contrast, seems deliberately designed to get us talking about what happens to a deprived area when the middle classes move in.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Anita Singh awarded the series five stars, labelling it as \"a treat\" from both the writers and its stars.",
      "She added that Punch \"excels at physical comedy and is hilarious as she tries to style out her reduced circumstances\".",
      "\"The script is deft and the writers nail the various stages of parenting teenagers: helping them through first love, carting them home in disgrace when they've got drunk and thrown up on themselves, and realising that you can't help them with their maths homework any more because you don't understand it.\"",
      "'A modern Mrs Bucket'",
      "In another five-star review, the Times' Carol Midgley noted how spin-off series \"can easily disappoint, as Joey, a feeble offshoot of Friends, showed\".",
      "\"But I just knew that Amandaland, offspring of the mighty Motherland, would be glorious... and it is.\"",
      "She likened the \"deliciously desperate\" new show, and its leading woman, to being  \"a Hyacinth Bucket for 2025\".",
      "\"Keeping Up Appearances was so joyous because it mocked the absurdity of prideful status-seeking,\" she noted of the Patricia Routledge-starring 1990s BBC sitcom.",
      "\"Amanda is Hyacinth for the new age (imagine if Hyacinth had had social media!).",
      "\"Punch carries most of the heavy lifting with ease,\" she wrote, \"and the result is not only a spin-off that punches above its weight: it is lovely, life-affirming escapism.\"",
      "There was another five-star rating from Christopher Stevens in the Daily Mail.",
      "\"Amanda's an awful woman, of course,\" he said, \"a backstabbing snob who treats her children as accessories and turns every encounter with her 'mum chums' at the school gates into a blood sport.\"",
      "He also praised Dame Joanna, saying she \"gathers up the laughs and sweeps them into her handbag like an aristocratic shoplifter on a spree\".",
      "Tilly Pearce of the Radio Times awarded four stars, writing: \"Spin-off shows can often be a bit of a tricky tightrope. To be successful, they need to find balance with the old and new, which is kind of apt, given Amanda's situation.",
      "\"Thankfully, Amandaland manages to achieve this in spades, providing a fresh twist on the familiar humour with a new gang, new location, and new phase of motherhood to deal with.\""

    "story": [
      "\"I have so much money now that I could hire someone to kill you, and nobody would know. No-one would miss you. No-one would know anything.\"",
      "Former music executive Daniel Evans says he can still remember the threat from his old boss, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs - then known as Puff Daddy - to a colleague. It was 1997, he says, in the New York office of Combs's Grammy Award-winning music label Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"It was like, this is what money does to you,\" he says.",
      "Combs was often \"prickly\", but Evans says power was transforming him. Just days before, the hip-hop mogul had received his biggest reward to date \u2013 $6m (\u00a34.8m) to mark the label's success, which boasted platinum-selling artists like The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "That year Combs's music career reached its peak, with his empire soon expanding into fashion, alcohol and even his own TV network.",
      "Nearly three decades on, his legacy is in ruins as he sits in jail awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering alongside battling dozens of lawsuits accusing him of drugging and assault at lavish parties, high-end hotels and in his label's recording studio. He denies all the allegations.",
      "Now the BBC has spoken to more than 20 people who worked with Combs at Bad Boy Records - including former executives, assistants and producers - who describe for the first time troubling incidents they say they witnessed during its 1990s rise.",
      "Some executives say they had concerns after seeing Combs having sex with women in the studio, including one incident where the employee says the young woman did not seem to react when he walked in. Another staff member complained Combs asked her to bring him condoms.",
      "The BBC also heard that corporate funds were used to fly in women from across the US for sex at the request of artists and other employees.",
      "\"There was a course of conduct that became more egregious over time and that conduct does go back to the 90s,\" says Tony Buzbee, a US lawyer representing dozens of alleged victims, including one who says Combs threatened to kill her in similar terms to the incident Evans says he witnessed.",
      "His client alleges Combs raped her on a bathroom floor at a promotional party held for The Notorious B.I.G., the label's biggest star, in 1995. She says in her lawsuit that afterwards, Combs told her not to tell anyone or \"you will disappear\".",
      "In a statement, Combs's legal team accused Buzbee of being \"more interested in media attention than the truth\" and said the hip-hop star \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone\".",
      "The 55-year-old's lawyers said they had not been provided with sufficient details about the BBC's claims to present the facts that would \"counter these fabricated accusations\".",
      "\"As we've said before, Mr Combs cannot dignify every publicity stunt or facially absurd claim with a response. He has full confidence in the judicial process, where the truth will prevail: these accusations are pure fiction,\" they said.",
      "A brash go-getter, Sean Combs became an overnight millionaire when he launched Bad Boy Records in 1993 with a roster of top artists.",
      "It was Combs's first venture, having already built a name for himself as a talent director at another music label, Uptown Records, aged 19.",
      "\"He said that he wanted to be one of the biggest artists in the world and it didn't matter if I believed him or not,\" remembers Jimmy Maynes, a former Uptown colleague.",
      "Maynes remembers Combs having a short fuse in the office, sometimes banging \"his hands up against the desk\" like a \"bratty kid\" and yelling if he did not get his way.",
      "Combs was eventually fired from Uptown and at the age of 23 started Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"He's the hardest working man that I've ever met and always wanted people to match his energy,\" says Daniel Evans, a senior executive who managed Bad Boy's recording budgets and artists' contracts between 1994 and 1997.",
      "Combs described himself as the \"Great Gatsby\" and swiftly became known for hosting coveted celebrity bashes at New York nightclubs, on the beaches of Cancun, Mexico, and later infamous \"White Parties\" - named after the all-white dress code - in the Hamptons.",
      "Even President Donald Trump attended events in the 90s, says Evans, who once saw him sit on a golden throne at Combs's 30th birthday and exclaim: \"I'm the real King of New York!\"",
      "\"We were all really young. I was 24 years old,\" reflects Evans, who was one of the label's original employees. \"People wanted to party, have fun, hook up and build good memories.\"",
      "But looking back, Evans says he is troubled by some of the things he witnessed about his boss's behaviour and the company culture.",
      "In about 1995, he says he walked in on Combs having sex with a young woman at Daddy's House, Bad Boy's New York recording studio near Times Square.",
      "\"I was getting ready to go home for the night and looking for my jacket. Open the door and he's having sex with this girl,\" says Evans, who thought the studio was empty as it was silent. Combs swore and shouted at him to leave. \"I thought I was getting fired,\" he says.",
      "Evans remembers the young woman had been brought to the studio, presumably for a tour, by a party-promoter who was a friend of Combs. His boss seemed sober, while she was quiet and did not really talk, he says, wondering if she was high on drugs or just shy.",
      "He says it did not seem unusual at the time. But recalling how the woman did not react when he entered the room, he says: \"Knowing what I know now, there's a lot of speculation about what state she was in\u2026 usually both parties are very responsive during the act.\"",
      "Felicia Newsome, the manager of Daddy's House recording studio between 1994 and 2000, says inappropriate conduct in the music industry as a whole was rife at the time.",
      "\"It was abnormal if somebody reported it, but it wasn't abnormal for it to be happening,\" she says.",
      "Newsome says an employee once called her to the studio in the middle of the night because Combs was in his underwear, about to have sex with a model and another woman. He was demanding the staff member fetch him condoms, she recalls.",
      "\"I said to Puffy, don't ever ask anyone here to go and get condoms,\" says Newsome, who arrived while they were getting dressed again. \"He replied: 'I didn't need anything like that, ma,' and never did it again.\"",
      "Newsome, then in her 30s, says she found Combs reasonable and that he changed his behaviour when she challenged him. On one occasion, when the studio first opened in 1995, she says Combs was unhappy about the look of the countertops and called her a \"bitch\" in front of staff.",

      "She says she demanded a public apology and temporarily shut the studio, asking him: \"If I'm bringing women into this space, which is open 24 hours, how do you want to treat people?\"",
      "Combs responded that he wanted it to be an inclusive and safe environment, she says.",
      "But while Newsome ran the studio with an \"iron fist\", she says other staff were less comfortable calling Combs out.",
      "\"Bad Boy Records was a crazy house with a lot of young people who wanted to touch the King's robes,\" she says.",
      "Former staff say the label was run by twenty-something executives and a large number of interns, some of whom were of school age. There were often sexual relationships between employees and the interns, they say.",
      "Evans remembers an uncomfortable moment with a 14-year-old in his own team, who he says propositioned him.",
      "\"She says to me, you work really hard. If you ever want to like, get loose, you and I should kick it\u2026 but not tonight, I have a curfew.\"",
      "Evans says he sent her home and called the next day, telling her not to return to work. He did not report her, but two weeks later she was back working in the mailroom.",
      "Artists and other employees at Combs's record label would sometimes also request for women to be flown in to have sex at the studio, the former executive says.",
      "\"If they had a [sexual] specialty in something, they would be flown in,\" says Evans, who told the BBC he knew because he controlled the budgets. Money for the flights would be set aside and logged under travel, he adds.",
      "\"It was probably like thousands of dollars,\" says Evans. \"I don't think it happened all that often, but it was definitely a recording expense.\"",
      "Evans says Combs's own requests were managed by his personal assistants. One told the BBC that Combs would often ask them to fly in women he was \"messing around with\" and put them up in hotels, though the assistant said they were not sex workers.",
      "In the 2000s, the Daddy's House recording studio further changed, two former staff say, into a culture of \"sex, drugs and rock'n'roll\". Combs would regularly bring \"random women\" there to party, turning up with an entourage of dozens of people in \"three white jeeps, with white rims and white leather seats\", they say. Other artists would demand suitcases of Ciroc vodka and one even brought a monkey to a session, according to a former executive.",
      "The studio is one of the locations where women have since accused Combs of drugging and raping them. Model Crystal McKinney alleges the mogul plied her with alcohol and marijuana before sexually assaulting her there in 2003. That same year, a woman alleges that Combs and two associates gang raped her at the studio when she was 17.",
      "Combs's lawyers say he \"looks forward to proving his innocence\", adding that McKinney's claims are \"without merit\".",
      "Many ex-staff say they still find it hard to reconcile the allegations with the man they knew. \"These accusations are a surprise to me, as I am sure it is to many of our circle,\" says Jeffery Walker, a close friend of Combs who was part of Bad Boy's original production team. \"I've been to White Parties and of course studio sessions, and none of what he is accused of went down in my sight.\"",
      "Evans was also sceptical about some of the claims until he saw the footage of Casandra Ventura, Combs's ex-partner of 10 years and a former Bad Boy artist, being brutally beaten by the rapper in a hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Ventura was the first person to sue Combs back in November 2023, alleging that he had trapped her in a cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking during their relationship. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day for an undisclosed amount.",
      "\"It's not the first time I've seen that temper,\" recalls Evans, thinking back to the death threat he says he witnessed back in 1997. \"It's hard to see. The guy in the video with Cassie is almost identical to the guy who threatened the employee. So, you wonder, has anything changed?\"",
      "Over the years, Sean Combs has repeatedly reinvented himself - from Puff Daddy, to P Diddy and in recent years, \"Love\".",
      "\"If I'm acting crazy, like 'ahhh!' that's Diddy. If I'm dancing real smooth with a girl, that's Puff Daddy. And if I'm looking like I'm nervous or scared or shy, that's Sean,\" he said in an interview in 2015.",
      "With more details likely to emerge when he goes on trial in May, many of those who were close to the rapper are questioning whether they knew the real Sean Combs at all.",
      "\"One could think that he's just a disgusting human being, but that's not my memory of Puff,\" says Jimmy Maynes, who grew up with Combs in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "But after a pause, he adds: \"Or maybe money just gives people the freedom to be exactly who they really are, and he was that guy all along.\"",

      "\"I have been working for almost a decade now, well trying to work. And that was my ultimate dream, to go to Cannes. And we had a film in the main competition, and then we won [the top prize, the Palme D'Or] and that was crazy in itself.\"",

      "\"As an actor sometimes I felt like I was shooting a very romantic film, and sometimes it was almost like a horror film, or a drama, or a slapstick comedy. To navigate through my character with all of these different genres was fun. It was a challenge, and I liked it!\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2025 02:51:39 GMT",
    "summary": "After being struck down by winter illness, the BBC's James Gallagher goes in search of ways to boost his immune system.",
    "story": [
      "It is a cold morning in the depths of winter.",
      "And I feel like I've left my sanity as well as my warm clothes in the changing room as I stride out to the edge of a reservoir in my swim shorts.",
      "A brightly coloured chalk sign informs me that the water temperature today is a chilly 3.9C, as one of the regulars tells me this is not cold water swimming, it's \"ice\" water swimming.",
      "How did I end up here?",
      "Well, I've become enthralled by the idea of enhancing or boosting the immune system. My body has been the living embodiment of the \"quademic\" that the NHS spent all winter warning us about. It's been a relentless stream of colds and coughs and one explosive tummy.",
      "Our immune systems already do a fantastic job fighting viruses and other nasties. If I collected all the air I breathed out over the course of a minute it would contain 100 to 10,000 bacteria, 25,000 viruses and a single fungus, according to Prof John Tregoning, immunologist at Imperial College London.",
      "\"You're breathing these things in all the time; there's just a swirling mass of pathogens [organisms that cause disease] in the air,\" he says.",
      "But there's plenty of foods, supplements and activities that are touted for their \"immune-boosting\" properties. Can we dial up our protection?",
      "Can a cold water swim stop you getting ill?",
      "And that's why I find myself wading out and pushing off for a chilling blast of breaststroke.",
      "The icy water is like fire on my skin and all my brain can think of is making it to the pontoon without needing help from the lifeguards.",
      "But studies have shown the adrenaline hit of the cold water does flood the blood stream with infection-fighting cells.",
      "White blood cells \u2013 which could produce antibodies or attack infected tissue \u2013 move out of their normal homes and head out on patrol thinking there could be an infection. So does this mean I'm more protected?",
      "\"Within a few hours that all goes back to normal,\" says Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh.",
      "\"There is no evidence that people who go cold water swimming have fewer colds or fewer infections.\"",
      "Cold water dips and swims: the benefits and risks",
      "Listen: Can you really boost your immune system?",
      "Regular exercise may give you a younger immune system",
      "There might not be the evidence for cold water, but regular exercise may well do the trick.",
      "On average adults get two to three colds per year and children between five and eight, says Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP and expert in evidence-based medicine, at the University of St Andrews.",
      "\"[But] people who do moderate amounts of exercise tend to report fewer viral infections,\" she says.",
      "There is a lack of conclusive clinical trials, but the data we have is \"all pointing in the direction of it being good for you\u2026 but not a miracle cure,\" according to Dr McCartney.",
      "Laboratory studies have suggested regular exercise may slow the ageing of the immune system. Your body's defences are in decline from our 20s onwards, but research on 80-year-old cyclists suggested they had the immune systems of people decades younger.",
      "\"I know the trials have not really been done in high enough quality, but I'm going to be doing a lot of cycling,\" she says.",
      "What about vitamins?",
      "The first thing that springs to my mind is vitamin C \u2013 either by devouring a mountain of oranges or in pill form.",
      "\"It's a no from me,\" says Dr McCartney. Being deficient may impair the immune system, but for the vast majority there is little to be gained from having extra. The same goes for multivitamins, which says Dr McCartney just make \"expensive urine\".",
      "However, the evidence around vitamin D is hotly debated rather than being a firm no. Vitamin D levels dip in winter as it is made when our skin is exposed to sunlight.",
      "\"I think the evidence is pointing towards possible benefits for people who've got respiratory disease and who are very low in vitamin D,\" says Dr McCartney, but there is \"insufficient\" evidence that it would help everyone.",
      "And while you're thinking what you might put in the shopping trolley, the jury is still out on whether prebiotics and probiotics that change the good bacteria in your gut also benefit immunity.",
      "\"I do believe that is a really important area of study, but we are lacking the real world data that would enable you to recommend this,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "She also says echinacea, turmeric and ginger shots are not going to give you an immune boost.",
      "Keep an eye on the clock?",
      "Your immune system's abilities are not fixed throughout the day.",
      "\"Our immune system is most effective in the early morning at around the time we wake up, continues to be highly effective through the early part of the day and then later on in the day it starts to wind down,\" says Prof Riley.",
      "This is why your cold often feels worse in the morning as your symptoms are the result of an immune system firing on all cylinders.",
      "The decline kicks in \"about four or five o'clock in the afternoon\", so you might have better protection if you are vaccinated, or exposed to someone coughing, in the morning.",
      "As the immune system does have this 24-hour cycle, then having  \"a regular daily rhythm\" rather than a mix of late nights and long lie-ins at the weekend \"may well help boost your immune system\", says Prof Riley.",
      "Stop damaging your immune defences!",
      "While we are thinking of boosting our immune system we should also remember there are things that actually increase our vulnerability to infection.",
      "One of the big ones is smoking because it directly damages the lungs so they are a less effective barrier to viruses.",
      "\"If you imagine the lungs like a sieve, smoking will break holes in the sieve, so more can get through,\" says Prof Tregoning.",
      "It also dials up inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation is like a thermostat for the immune system and is a normal part of how the body reacts to an infection.",
      "But \"uncontrolled inflammation is bad for you\" as it disrupts the immune system \"so you may respond less well\".",
      "Obesity is another factor that can increase susceptibility to infections as well as the severity by ramping up inflammation in the body.",
      "\"Both of those things can be difficult for people to stop or to reverse, but they are probably the most modifiable ones,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "Destress if you can",
      "Being constantly stressed raises levels of the hormone cortisol in the body.",
      "Yet, cortisol dampens the immune system which may leave you more prone to infection.",
      "Prof Tregoning says this may be the explanation for why being in nature, going for a walk, spending time with friends \u2013 even cold water swimming \u2013 may have some beneficial effect.",
      "\"You're less stressed, less cortisol, so therefore your immune system is more fit for the role it is trying to do,\" he says.",
      "Prof Riley adds: \"There is absolutely no doubt that being happy, being in a positive frame of mind, has a very, very important effect on our bodily functions.\"",
      "Stress: How to control it",
      "Squirt some salty water up your nose",
      "You have probably seen products in the shop that you can spray up each of your nostrils at the first sign of a cold.",
      "A report in the Lancet showed they do work.",
      "It gave thousands of people either a salt water (saline) spray or a gel-based one. They could use it up to six times a day whenever they felt they were coming down with something.",
      "People who just went about their daily lives without a nasal spray spent an average of eight days being ill during the study.",
      "But that fell to six days in those using a either salt water (saline) or a branded gel-based spray.",
      "Dr McCartney argues that a branded spray would be no better than a normal saline spray.",
      "So can the immune system really be boosted?",
      "If you are already doing all the usual things to look after your health \u2013 not smoking, eating healthily, exercising regularly \u2013 then your immune system is already in the \"best possible condition\" to respond to an infection, says Prof Riley.",
      "\"Can you do anything to boost above being a normal, healthy person? There's just no real evidence that you can,\" she says.",
      "\"But there are things you can do to improve your immunity against particular individual infections and that is to be vaccinated.\"",
      "And maybe instead of spending your money on the latest immune-boosting craze, she suggests thinking about ways of not getting infected in the first place so \"be careful who you socialise with\".",

    "story": [
      "\"I feel very angry, upset, worthless, and like my mental health and my life does not matter,\" says Jessie, propped up in a hospital bed.",
      "She is recording this in a video diary. Blue NHS curtains are drawn around the bed and all her possessions are stacked up in the tiny chaotic space this creates.",
      "Among the piles of boxes and bags sit the dolls she holds to keep her calm.",
      "Thirty-five-year-old Jessie spent 550 days in Northampton General Hospital. For nearly all that time, she was medically fit to leave but finding her a suitable place to go to was difficult.",
      "The BBC has followed her story for more than five months as the NHS trust took costly High Court action against her, to have her evicted from the hospital bed she was occupying.",
      "Jessie was eventually arrested and taken to a care home where she says she feels anxious.",
      "Her story is an extreme example, but it demonstrates the acute pressures faced by a care system coping with more complex cases, the knock-on effect to the NHS, and how the person at the heart of it can feel lost.",
      "North Northamptonshire Council, which is responsible for her housing and care, says it cannot comment because of an ongoing police investigation into Jessie's behaviour.",
      "The hospital says it \"is not the best environment for patients who are not in need of acute medical care\".",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care has told the BBC: \"This is a troubling case which shows how our broken NHS discharge system is failing vulnerable people.\"",
      "Jessie was one of more than 70 people who contacted the BBC after reading about Matthew in Surrey - who would end up spending more than a year stuck on a hospital ward before being moved to a care home.",
      "Most who wrote to us told of their struggles to find the social care they needed, some also faced long waits to get out of hospital.",
      "At the start of January 2025, nearly 13,000 out of the more than 100,000 hospital beds in England were occupied by people who didn't have a medical reason to be there, according to official figures.",
      "For people delayed for more than a week, the most common reasons were a lack of social care available in their own homes, or a shortage of places in care or rehabilitation homes.",
      "Such delays have become normal, say experts.",
      "Jessie's story",
      "It is very rare for a patient to be taken to court by the NHS - Jessie's is only the fourth case since 2006. So how did she come to be arrested in her hospital bed?",
      "She arrived at Northampton General on 14 April 2023 needing treatment for cellulitis, a bacterial infection affecting the skin, which can be serious.",
      "She uses a wheelchair and needs help with all her personal care. She has also been diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder.",
      "Jessie likes games, arts and crafts, and trips to garden centres. She also finds life difficult and can be challenging to those trying to help her. When stressed, she self-harms and can threaten to harm others.",
      "By the end of April, she was ready to be discharged from hospital, but was told she could not return to the nursing home where she had lived for nine years because it could no longer meet her needs.",
      "Jessie - who is unable to work and reliant on benefits - became increasingly isolated stuck inside her hospital cubicle on the six-bedded ward. She says her mental health deteriorated further, people would stare at her and she felt safer with the curtains drawn.",
      "From documents we have seen, and from what Jessie and her mother, Hilda, have told us, it was about a year before she was offered an alternative place by the local council.",
      "Sarah Scobie, deputy director of research at the Nuffield Trust think tank, says patients stuck in hospital for three weeks or more, like Jessie, tend to need a lot of support, and the number of these cases is increasing.",
      "With councils - who pay for most social care - financially squeezed and overstretched, many care homes and home-care providers are only given short-term funding, she says.",
      "It is \"difficult for them to establish services, recruit staff, train staff, invest in a service, if they don't know whether that funding is going to continue,\" she adds.",
      "The government says it is providing an additional \u00a326bn to help \"shift the focus of care from hospital to community, and tackle delayed discharges by improving the links between the NHS and social care\".",
      "It also says a review of adult social care led by Baroness Louise Casey, which starts work in April, will draw up a plan for a fair and affordable care system for the future.",
      "In Jessie's case, legal documents say the council investigated nearly 120 care places. Only one was offered to her.",
      "This was a supported living flat in a nearby town, with two care staff initially present 24 hours a day.",
      "But the town has upsetting memories for Jessie. She finds it too difficult to talk about, other than to say \"bad things\" happened.",
      "She told us she was desperate to leave hospital, but the thought of going there made her feel suicidal. So, she refused the one place offered.",
      "Under the 2014 Care Act, Jessie should be able to express a preference about where she lives.",
      "She has mental capacity, but was assessed by the NHS as needing a professional advocate to support her in this, helping her understand the decisions she is asked to make and to explain her views to others.",
      "Jessie was referred to an advocacy firm by the council, but in June 2024 her case was closed after she asked for a new advocate but then didn't respond to further contact.",
      "The health and care system is \"convoluted, complicated, very bureaucratic\" and it is easy for a patient's voice to get lost, says Caroline Entwistle from the advocacy charity, VoiceAbility.",
      "She believes an advocate can \"take that pressure off the person who's feeling quite overwhelmed\" - but that funding for such services is not keeping up with demand.",
      "The hospital did provide Jessie with mental health support while she was in her cubicle. But she believed no-one was listening to her.",
      "\"I explained all the reasons I wasn't happy with [the accommodation],\" she says, \"but they just went ahead with it anyway.\"",
      "In August 2024, 16 months after she arrived, the hospital started legal action against Jessie to repossess the bed she was in.",
      "She did not really understand what was happening, she says. Neither did her mother. They could not find a solicitor and had no advocate, so the first two hearings went ahead without anyone representing Jessie's views.",
      "The NHS trust argued a patient didn't have the right to choose their placement, and that a hospital bed took up significant resource.",
      "It said it had taken account of Jessie's vulnerabilities throughout and the package of care offered by the council was significant, with staff present 24 hours a day to keep her safe.",
      "A care plan, which detailed the support Jessie needed, was only given to the court at the final hearing. The date suggests the assessment was completed the day before. It also notes that \"Jessie is unable to communicate effectively\".",
      "At the final High Court hearing on 4 October, Jessie attended remotely from hospital. Within minutes she was overwhelmed and had to leave. Her mother struggled to speak for her.",
      "The judge said Jessie could challenge the council's assessment of whether the accommodation and care were right for her, but she could not remain in hospital \"when she does not need a bed there, and has not needed one for over a year, and others do\".",
      "He ruled that Jessie must leave hospital, and said \"we must hope the transition goes smoothly\".",
      "The hospital trust says it is committed to working with \"care partners to provide the best possible care for those in our communities\" in the place that \"best suits their needs\".",
      "The most recent data, from 2020-21, suggests a standard NHS hospital bed costs \u00a3345 per day. Adjusting for inflation, this would mean Jessie's hospital stay is likely to have cost more than \u00a3200,000. We do not know how much the legal action cost.",
      "Ten days after Jessie's final hearing, 18 months after she arrived in hospital, the police arrested her. She spent several hours at a police station before being moved to the flat in the town that holds bad memories.",
      "Police are investigating her for a number of alleged incidents, she told us, including for sending offensive emails shortly before she was evicted in October.",
      "Since moving, Jessie says she has self-harmed and the police have been called on three occasions - once by Jessie, twice by staff.",

      "In Dorset, 844 seizures were made by officers and in Windsor and Maidenhead 21.",
      "Because the products are fairly new there are no specific regulations covering advertising, strength or age restrictions.",
      "Instead, they come under General Product Safety Regulations which means they need to be clearly labelled in English with safety guidelines.",
      "Jody Kerman, head of Trading Standards at Oxfordshire County Council said: \"Nicotine is a poison, you need to know who to contact if something goes wrong, what to do if you swallow it, how many is safe to have over a period of time.",
      "\"If it's not in English how are you supposed to know how to use it safely?\"",
      "He added that he suspects much of the growth in interest in these products is from footballers, influencers and social media.",

      "They are sometimes informally referred to as 'snus' - although that is a tobacco product that has been banned in the UK and EU since 1992.",
      "While they are less harmful than smoking, they are highly addictive and not recommended for teenagers or non-smokers.",
      "Most pouches contain six to 20 milligrams (mg) of nicotine while some products contain 50mg - that is about five times stronger than an average cigarette.",
      "Some illegal pouches claim to contain as much as 150mg of nicotine, although tests conducted on behalf of Trading Standards found actual levels varied greatly.",

      "\"This is what can happen when infrastructure issues are left untreated,\" said head of estates Michael Soroka during a visit by the BBC.",
      "Other hospital employees said they were concerned other wards could \"follow the same fate\" as plans to rebuild and improve Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) and City Hospital were delayed until 2037 at the earliest by the government.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government inherited a \"crumbling NHS\" and the new timeline was \"realistic and deliverable\".",
      "The former pain clinic in the QMC's south block previously saw hundreds of patients per year.",
      "It had fewer than a dozen rooms and treated people with both neurological and physical pain as part of an outpatient service.",
      "Over time, poor infrastructure, including old pipes leaking in the mechanical room above, escalated to a point where the clinic had multiple safety hazards and became unusable.",
      "It has been abandoned for the last seven years.",
      "Mr Soroka, 48, who is based at the QMC, described the state of the former unit as \"shameful\".",
      "He said: \"It is embarrassing to see the state the clinic is in now. Catastrophic leaks caused this and it became impossible to maintain.",
      "\"We need new pipes badly. Pipe and ventilation issues impact every floor.\"",
      "The pipework in the hospital was built in 1976 and most of the site's \"plant rooms\" share the same pipework as the former pain clinic.",
      "Plant rooms store equipment, like pipes, that keep the building running safely.",
      "Mr Sokora added: \"The equipment in our plant rooms is coming towards the end its life.",
      "\"This could cause further leaks if it isn't replaced soon enough.",
      "\"We are full here at the QMC. Space is a premium, so it's a real shame that this clinic is now unusable.\"",
      "The lack of space at the hospital has become more apparent in recent years.",
      "In winter 2023, patients \"lined corridors\" as the hospital ran out of bed space in its A&E department.",
      "The QMC is also experiencing problems on wards that currently treat patients.",
      "Mr Soroka said: \"We do have leaks on some wards - one on the F floor floods regularly.",
      "\"Any issues are patched up quickly to ensure they are safe for patients and staff, but the root problems aren't addressed.",
      "\"The team here keeps the hospital running on the face of it, but behind the scenes, behind closed doors, we are struggling.\"",
      "Improving the pipe works and general maintenance is part of the hospital's rebuilding plan, but Mr Soroka fears waiting over a decade for improvements is \"too long\".",
      "At the trust's City Hospital, two wings of the St Francis building, dating back to the 1900s, are also abandoned.",
      "The space was formerly patient wards and more recently became finance offices, but they are now empty.",
      "Leaks in the roof and a failure of the steam system meant it became \"uneconomical\" to keep repairing the space.",
      "A spokesperson for Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust, which runs the QMC and City Hospital, said: \"The building itself can withstand the test of time, and with proper investment could become an excellent space for us to use.\"",
      "What is the hospitals rebuilding plan?",
      "The QMC and City Hospital were included in the Conservative government pledge to build 40 new hospitals by 2030.",
      "The Nottingham Hospitals Rebuild project, called Tomorrow's NUH, was included in the plans and expected to cost about \u00a32bn.",
      "Labour Health Secretary Wes Streeting declared last month work will not commence until 2037.",
      "The plans for 40 new hospitals by 2030 were a Conservative election promise, he said, adding they were not affordable.",
      "In a statement, NUH said it was \"very disappointed\" to hear work had been pushed back.",
      "Its plans included a new centre for women, children and families, and a bespoke cancer care building.",
      "Phil Britt, director of major programmes at NUH, which includes Tomorrow's NUH, said: \"We spent years developing these plans because we want to make great changes to the hospital.",
      "\"This clinic is an extreme example of what can happen, and we had to make the difficult choice to close it and put our resources elsewhere.",
      "\"There is an increasing likelihood that we'll see more places like this over the next decade if nothing is done.\"",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"The New Hospital Programme was on a completely unrealistic timeframe and was unfunded.",
      "\"We have now set out a timeline that's both realistic and deliverable, alongside \u00a31bn to address the backlog of critical NHS maintenance and repairs to help ensure hospitals are safe and sustainable.\"",

      "Two couples have told the BBC they went through with abortions after an NHS trust mistakenly told them their unborn babies had serious genetic conditions.",
      "They say errors by doctors at the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust led to them terminating their pregnancies.",
      "Another family say a last-minute scan on the day they were due to have an abortion changed their minds and they are now the parents of a healthy nine-year-old boy.",
      "The trust, which is currently at the centre of the largest maternity inquiry in the history of the NHS, said its foetal medicine teams strived to provide \"compassionate and professional\" care.",
      "'The most impossible choice'",
      "\"Our daughter should be here,\" says Carly Wesson, who terminated her pregnancy at 14 weeks.",
      "Ms Wesson and her partner Carl Everson were expecting their first child in January 2019, when a 12-week scan indicated their baby had a high chance of having Down's Syndrome.",
      "They were offered a test, known as chorionic villus sampling (CVS), to check if their baby had any genetic or chromosomal conditions.",
      "Two days later, the foetal care team at City Hospital in Nottingham told them the initial results indicated their daughter had a rare genetic condition called Patau's Syndrome, which often results in miscarriage, stillbirth, or the baby dying shortly after birth.",
      "Ms Wesson, 43, says she had a conversation shortly afterwards with a foetal care consultant.",
      "She says she was told her baby would be left with severe care needs, and that it may not survive the pregnancy.",
      "\"It's the most impossible choice we've ever had to make. We thought the best option was to end the pregnancy because the baby was suffering.\"",
      "Results from a more detailed analysis of the sample were due back two weeks later.  The couple asked if it might show a different outcome, but they say their consultant advised them it would not.",
      "The couple decided to have an abortion.",
      "\"It's just an awful, impossible situation,\" says Ms Wesson. \"There was no good outcome, we had no hope.\"",
      "Six weeks after the abortion, they were asked to attend a meeting at City Hospital, which they assumed was a routine follow-up.",
      "\"[The consultant] just walked in and the first thing she said was 'I have got something to tell you, your results have changed',\" says Ms Wesson.",
      "The second test, called a long term CVS culture, showed their daughter, who the couple had nicknamed Ladybird, had no chromosomal abnormality.",
      "When they asked if their daughter would have survived, Ms Wesson says the doctor told the couple: \"Well, you could have miscarried anyway.\"",
      "\"That's always stuck with me - it was almost malicious,\" she says.",
      "An investigation into the death carried out by the trust said the second test showed \"all 50 cells studied had a normal chromosome compliment\".",
      "The first test result - which the couple say was the basis on which they decided to terminate the pregnancy - had been a false positive.",
      "This is \"a well-recognised hazard of early CVS results\", the investigation found.",
      "The trust, it concluded, \"must take responsibility for an outcome which would not have occurred were it not for a series of deficiencies in care, knowledge and process, all lining up together\".",
      "\"Although not absolutely certain, it seems highly probable that the pregnancy was, in fact, chromosomally normal,\" it said.",
      "Anthony May, chief executive at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: \"I know that we failed Carly, Carl and their baby, Ladybird, in 2019, and for that I am truly sorry.  While words will never change the outcome, I can assure them and other families that we have investigated and learnt from this tragic case.",
      "\"Since 2019, we have implemented the findings from this incident, ensuring we have robust processes for checking, communicating and monitoring results.\"",
      "Wrong diagnosis",
      "Another family, who wish to remain anonymous, have told the BBC they ended their pregnancy in 2017 after they too were incorrectly told their baby had a genetic condition.",
      "Following a routine scan at 20 weeks, they say they were told there may be some abnormal development and\u202fwere referred to a foetal care consultant at City Hospital.",
      "A few days later, they were informed their baby likely had a life-limiting illness. As the condition was inherited, the parents were genetically tested to see if they were carriers, which the trust completed and promised expedited results.",
      "The BBC is not identifying the condition to protect the family's privacy, at their request.",
      "Several weeks later, with the results still not in, the family say the hospital called to tell them they had less than 24 hours to decide whether to terminate the pregnancy as it would be more complicated to carry out later.",
      "By this point, the pregnancy was just one day under 24 weeks, the legal limit for an abortion in most circumstances.",
      "Given the clear advice from doctors - that the baby might not survive or die shortly after birth, or have a life-limiting condition - the couple decided to end the pregnancy.",
      "When a post-mortem was carried out, the baby was found not to have the condition. The trust, they say, has never provided them with an explanation for the wrong diagnosis.",
      "\"I kept calling the hospital every day asking for those test results, I had my very much-wanted baby kicking inside me,\" the mother told the BBC.",
      "\"I needed to know whether to disconnect from the pregnancy, as I didn't know if my baby would survive. They never explained we had this time pressure. Then I got a frantic call in the late afternoon one day telling me we had to decide by the following day to terminate or it would be too late.\u202fIt was horrific.\"",
      "She says she had the termination on the labour ward, surrounded by other mums giving birth to healthy babies.",
      "An investigation into the maternity care provided by the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust is currently under way.",
      "The treatment that more than 2,000 families received at the trust's two hospitals - the Queen's Medical Centre and City Hospital - is being examined by senior midwife Donna Ockenden, who led the review into the maternity care scandal in Shrewsbury and Telford.",

      "The couple had already experienced a stillbirth when they became pregnant with their son in 2015.",
      "An eight-week scan showed up what looked like \"a black hole in the middle,\" according to the father.",
      "\"We were told that our baby wasn't emptying his bladder, that's what the big shape was,\" recalls his mother. \"If he couldn't empty his bladder, he would either go on to be stillborn or live a very short life.\"",
      "'It's going to die'",
      "A second scan was ordered, which the parents said showed an even bigger black shape.",
      "The baby, they say they were told, may develop genetic conditions which would be incompatible with life. They say they were offered a termination for medical reasons.",
      "\"I really remember us then telling friends, not with a happy, joyful, 'guess what, we're pregnant'. It was more of a 'we're having another baby and it's going to die'. [We did] things like planning that he would be buried in the place that we now visit with him [where his brother is buried],\" says his mother.",
      "After much discussion, the couple say they felt \"like there was only one choice to make\".",
      "They headed to the Queen's Medical Centre to take the medication that would end the pregnancy.",
      "The father, however, requested one final scan \"and absolutely crazily, while being scanned, our little baby emptied his bladder. So we didn't end the pregnancy.\"",
      "The parents say the trust has never given them an explanation about what happened.",

    "story": [
      "Triple killer Valdo Calocane was not forced to take his anti-psychotic medication in part because he did not like needles, a major review of his NHS care has revealed.",
      "The detail was published among a catalogue of failings identified by an independent report, which revealed \"the system got it wrong\" with Calocane, who stabbed to death Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates in Nottingham in June 2023.",
      "It laid out how Calocane, who has paranoid schizophrenia, had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings - after he was discharged when he repeatedly failed to engage with them.",
      "Mr Webber's mother Emma described the report as a \"horror show\".",
      "In response, the government repeated its commitment to a public inquiry into the attacks, with work ongoing to establish its scope.",
      "The NHS said it had taken the decision to publish the report in full, in line with the wishes of the families, and \"given the level of detail already in the public domain\".",
      "The independent review, by Theemis Consulting, looked into the treatment given to Calocane by Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust prior to the killings, as well as the interactions the NHS had with other agencies involved in his care.",
      "The key findings of the report include:",
      "Calocane's risk \"was not fully understood, managed, documented or communicated\"There were missed opportunities to take more assertive action towards Calocane's careThe voice of Calocane's family \"was not effectively considered to support the dynamic evaluation of risk\" during his treatmentOther patients under the care of the same trust, some of whom had been discharged, had also perpetrated acts of \"serious violence\" across 15 incidents between 2019 and 2023Calocane had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings",
      "Calocane's risk \"was not fully understood, managed, documented or communicated\"",
      "There were missed opportunities to take more assertive action towards Calocane's care",
      "The voice of Calocane's family \"was not effectively considered to support the dynamic evaluation of risk\" during his treatment",
      "Other patients under the care of the same trust, some of whom had been discharged, had also perpetrated acts of \"serious violence\" across 15 incidents between 2019 and 2023",
      "Calocane had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings",
      "The case, which resulted in Calocane being sentenced to a hospital order in January 2024, sparked a number of reviews including the mental health homicide review, commissioned by NHS England.",
      "Another, by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), is looking into both Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire Police.",
      "A review into the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) found while prosecutors had been right to accept Calocane's pleas of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility, they could have handled the case better.",
      "And in May, a judge ruled Calocane's sentence was not unduly lenient.",
      "Speaking after the release of the new report on Wednesday, Mrs Webber said: \"It's been additional trauma, horror, disbelief and fury - but all of that was anticipated and expected by all three families.\"",
      "She added: \"It leaves us feeling horrified, heartbroken, but even more determined now to make sure that it's addressed - that the government and the agencies react and listen properly.\"",
      "Mrs Webber also revealed she had been contacted by the family of one of the Southport stabbing victims.",
      "\"It's very rare that you can say to someone 'I know how dreadful that is' and know that that person really does know,\" she said.",
      "In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ian Coates's son James said the main focus was to keep working to make sure mistakes were not repeated.",
      "\"I know my father would be proud of me to keep fighting,\" he said.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the government had worked with NHS England to ensure the report was published in full.",
      "\"Sunlight is the best disinfectant,\" he said. \"The findings will help to support an inquiry into this attack and we'll set out the next steps as this develops.\"",
      "He added he had called for all the recommendations made in a previous Care Quality Commission (CQC) report into the case to be implemented across the country.",
      "The new report also sets out the contact Calocane had with mental health services before he killed Mr Webber, Ms O'Malley-Kumar and Mr Coates, and then stole Mr Coates's van before driving it into three pedestrians - Wayne Birkett, Marcin Gawronski and Sharon Miller - all of whom were seriously injured.",
      "The report states the former University of Nottingham student first came into contact with mental health services on 24 May 2020, when he was 28, when he was arrested for criminal damage to a neighbour's flat.",
      "It was documented that Calocane's behaviour was an episode of psychosis brought on by the stress of course work and a forthcoming exam, coupled with a lack of sleep.",
      "Shortly after returning to his home, Calocane again tried to gain access to a neighbour's flat. His neighbour was so frightened that she jumped from a first-floor window, sustaining back injuries which required surgery.",
      "Calocane was then detained for the first time under section 2 of the Mental Health Act, which meant he could be kept in hospital against his will for up to 28 days - known as a \"section\".",
      "Subsequent contacts with services saw him labelled as having paranoid schizophrenia.",
      "After about a month in hospital, Calocane was sent home with reviews expected from the community crisis team and the early intervention in psychosis (EIP) service.",
      "He was initially called by the crisis team. The contact was a phone call rather than a face-to-face appointment \"because of Covid-19 restrictions at the time\".",
      "His family expressed concerns because they felt he could \"play down his symptoms\" over the phone.",
      "In July 2020, Calocane was admitted to hospital for a second time after forcibly entering a neighbour's flat.",
      "He was sectioned again, this time under section 3 of the Mental Health Act, which allows for a longer hospital stay of up to six months.",
      "According to medical records shared by Calocane's family with BBC Panorama, while Calocane was ill in hospital, a psychiatrist observed that \"there seems to be no insight or remorse and the danger is that this will happen again and perhaps Valdo will end up killing someone\".",
      "Two weeks after this entry was made, Calocane was discharged from Highbury Hospital.",
      "According to the report, his family \"felt this was a real missed opportunity to fully understand [Calocane's] diagnosis, risk and to get to grips with a treatment plan that [Calocane] was concordant with\".",
      "Three months before his third hospital admission in August 2021, Calocane's family again reported concerns over his mental health.",
      "At the end of August, his care co-ordinator visited him at home with a colleague, noting that he was no longer taking his medication and had no intention of continuing treatment.",
      "A month later, the report said he had \"significantly assaulted\" police officers who attended in support of a Mental Health Act assessment.",
      "On a number of occasions, his care co-ordinator had suggested the use of depot medication - which releases slowly over time meaning patients need to administer medications less frequently.",
      "But, the report said, the inpatient teams were trying to treat him \"in the least restrictive way\", and took on board his reasons for not wanting to take injectable depot medication, \"which included him not liking needles\".",
      "After multiple missed appointments, in January 2022, officials contemplated discharging Calocane from the EIP service due to a lack of engagement.",
      "But the following day, the EIP learned Calocane had trapped two housemates in their flat, which resulted in the police being called.",
      "He was assessed under the Mental Health Act, but not detained.",
      "Calocane was admitted to hospital at the end of January 2022 for almost a month - his fourth hospital admission.",
      "After being discharged, it was noted that none of Calocane's care providers should visit him at home alone because of his \"history of violence and aggression\".",
      "Calocane then missed a few appointments to collect his medication over the coming months, and a new care co-ordinator tried to contact him multiple times.",
      "After these failed attempts, a decision was taken in September 2022 to discharge Calocane from the EIP service to his GP.",
      "The report said \"opportunities to assertively try to reach out to [Calocane] when he disengaged from services were limited\" because of pressures in the team.",
      "\"Due to multiple factors, including workload, the discharge system did not function as intended,\" the report said.",
      "'Watershed moment'",
      "It added there was no contact between Calocane and mental health services, or his GP, for roughly nine months from this time until the killings.",
      "Dr Jessica Sokolov, regional medical director at NHS England (Midlands), said it was \"clear the system got it wrong\" and apologised to the victims \"on behalf of the NHS and the organisations involved\" in Calocane's care.",
      "Claire Murdoch, NHS England's national mental health director, said the organisation had asked every mental health trust to review the report findings.",
      "Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, said the publication of the review \"should act as a watershed moment revealing the truth and honouring the needs of the families of victims of homicides by people with mental illness or disorder\".",
      "In a statement, Calocane's family said they were \"deeply sorry\" for \"this horrific tragedy\".",
      "They said: \"The report confirms what we and many others have known for a while: the mental healthcare system is in crisis and in need of immediate intervention, which we believe must come from the government. It is not enough to say that the NHS failed; we must be honest in recognising that the NHS has been set up for failure, and cannot be left to fix itself on its own.\"",
      "The chief executive of the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Ifti Majid, added: \"We apologise unreservedly for the opportunities we missed in the care of Valdo Calocane and accept the Theemis report in its entirety including its findings and recommendations.",
      "\"We are making clear progress with a trust-wide plan, which is already delivering key improvements in areas such as risk assessment and discharge processes.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 06:03:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Ricky Sawyer gave out medication illegally and some of his clients needed emergency hospital treatment.",
    "story": [
      "A self-styled \"beauty consultant\", whose celebrity client list includes Katie Price, is offering potentially dangerous cosmetic procedures to clients and handing over medication illegally - a BBC investigation has discovered.",
      "Ricky Sawyer specialises in liquid Brazilian butt-lifts (BBLs) - which involves injecting dermal filler into buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger.",
      "BBC News has spoken to five of his clients who needed emergency hospital treatment after their procedures. We have also been shown the testimonies of more than 30 women who say they have been left with serious complications such as sepsis and necrosis (tissue death).",
      "One woman told us she felt at the time she would rather \"have died\" than continue with the pain she was in following the treatment.",
      "Several local authorities have banned Mr Sawyer from practising in their areas.",
      "Our undercover filming captured Mr Sawyer handing out antibiotics without a valid prescription - a criminal offence. He is not qualified to prescribe and the pills were not labelled for a specific patient.",
      "He also offered to inject increasing doses of local anaesthetic without a prescriber present - again illegal - and did not ask for our reporter's weight, thus putting her at risk of an overdose.",
      "Posing as a potential client and her friend, we had booked a 45-minute appointment with Mr Sawyer through his Instagram page. We told him we wanted a 200ml (7fl oz) liquid BBL injection costing \u00a31,200. We paid a \u00a3200 deposit.",
      "Despite having advertised that all liquid BBLs would be carried out under the guidance of an \"ultrasound specialist doctor\", none was present at his pop-up clinic. He was working out of a small room in an east London office block - a non-clinical environment which would have increased the risk of infection.",
      "Within five minutes of being in his office, Mr Sawyer had begun to encourage our reporter to think about increasing the amount of filler. \"You might be surprised about how much product you can have and still look natural,\" he suggested.",
      "By the end of the appointment, Mr Sawyer had offered to inject a litre of filler - 500ml (almost a pint) per buttock - at a cost of \u00a32,000.",
      "We did not go through with it and later returned to put our allegations to him - but he refused to answer our questions and slammed the door on our reporter.",
      "Reviewing our footage, plastic surgeon Dalvi Humzah, who sits on the Joint Council of Cosmetic Practitioners, said Mr Sawyer's actions were \"shocking\", \"very dangerous\", and putting patients at a huge risk of infection and potentially fatal complications.",
      "\"Putting that volume in, in one sitting, is really dangerous,\" said Mr Humzah. \"The buttocks are such a large area that if they become infected it can overwhelm the body and could end in sepsis - or even death.\"",
      "The filler used for liquid BBLs is often made up of hyaluronic acid, which is commonly used in facial filling treatments. Because large amounts of the acid are involved in BBLs, and there is a risk of serious side effects such as blood clots and sepsis, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous cosmetic procedures.",
      "Mr Sawyer boasted on camera that he did up to seven procedures a day, six days a week. He can charge thousands of pounds per appointment.",
      "One of the women who said she had experienced serious complications after receiving a liquid BBL from Mr Sawyer was Joanne. A mum of two from south Wales, who only wants us to use her first name, she travelled seven hours to Essex for the treatment.",
      "Having had other cosmetic treatments before and having been persuaded by Ricky Sawyer's many adverts and celebrity endorsements, a liquid BBL didn't seem like such a big step to her.",
      "All she wanted, she says, was a \"peachy bum\".",
      "But when Joanne arrived, she began to have second thoughts.",
      "She had only been sent a postcode and says she seemed to be walking into an industrial estate.",
      "In the end, she found a small door into a block of flats and says she was told to wait in a \"dingy little hallway\" for about half an hour.",
      "\"I should have turned and ran,\" she says, \"but I had paid \u00a3600 deposit and travelled all this way.\"",
      "She was taken into a small room where there \"was only a bed, a tiny stool and a worktop\", and that is where she says she first met Ricky Sawyer.",
      "After counting out the rest of her cash - \u00a32,000 in total - she says he told her to stand in front of him while he sat on the stool.",
      "As he started to inject her with a litre (1.8 pints) of filler, the pain quickly became unbearable.",
      "\"I felt dizzy, sick and like shaky. My legs didn't even move properly. And that was all within a minute of him starting,\" she says. \"I remember looking round and he had white gloves on that were full of blood.\"",
      "By the end of the procedure, Joanne was in agony: \"I was in so much pain, my bottom was completely disfigured.\"",
      "She says she could barely sit down. By the time she got home the swelling had started and she could hardly walk.",
      "\"I messaged Ricky loads of times to say how bad I was feeling and how worried I was. He just told me to take my antibiotics.\"",
      "By this point, sepsis had begun to set in.",
      "\"My temperature kept on going up and I felt terrible,\" says Joanne. \"I had to phone 999. I was dripping with sweat and screaming.\"",
      "In hospital, she was attached to intravenous antibiotics. At one point, a surgeon drew on her buttock to indicate where they might need to cut, because the infection was spreading so quickly.",
      "After messaging Ricky Sawyer saying she was in hospital with sepsis, she says he blocked her from his Instagram account.",
      "Fortunately, Joanne did not need an operation.",
      "Another of Mr Sawyer's clients, Louise Moller, did need life-saving emergency surgery.",
      "Four days after receiving a liquid BBL at his Essex clinic in October 2023, the 28-year-old from Bolton was in hospital.",
      "She rang her mother, Janet, from Salford Royal's A&E department saying: \"Mum, I think I'm going to die.\"",
      "Louise had contracted sepsis and was warned by surgeons that she could die at any minute. To stop the infection from moving through her body, they cut dead tissue out of an area almost covering her entire left buttock.",
      "Janet promised her daughter she would prevent this from happening to anyone else and reported Ricky Sawyer to their local police station in Bolton.",
      "\"How can he carry on knowing he could kill someone?\" she told the BBC.",
      "However, Louise's case highlights the difficulty in holding practitioners like him accountable.",
      "Janet says she was told by police in Bolton that the file would need to be passed to Essex Police, where the incident happened.",
      "A prosecution could be difficult however, she was warned, because Louise had signed a consent form.",
      "BBC News has approached both Greater Manchester Police and Essex Police to get an update on the case - both have said it is down to the other to investigate.",
      "From a legal point of view, there is little to stop Mr Sawyer from practising.",
      "Injecting dermal fillers is seen as non-surgical and is unregulated, which means anyone can do it - and they can't be struck off and stopped.",
      "In September 2024, Alice Webb is believed to have become the first person to die after receiving a liquid BBL in the UK. Her procedure was not carried out by Ricky Sawyer.",
      "Following her death, Save Face - a group that campaigns for greater regulation to cover non-surgical procedures - called for a new law banning liquid BBLs from being carried out by anyone other than surgeons registered with the General Medical Council (GMC).",
      "Save Face's founder, Ashton Collins, says her organisation has received complaints from 39 women about Ricky Sawyer.",
      "All the women, she says, have told her they have been left needing urgent hospital treatment. Each of them, she says, had a BBL and suffered complications such as sepsis, necrosis and disfigurement.",
      "\"We've encouraged these women to report their experiences to the police,\" she says. \"Some have, and nothing has been done.\"",
      "So far, the most effective action has been taken by local authorities, three of which - Glasgow City Council, Epping Forest District Council and Brentwood Council -  confirmed they had issued prohibition notices under Health and Safety law to protect the public from serious injury.",
      "But \"he just moves on to different areas of the country and carries on\", says Ms Collins.",
      "We put our evidence to the Department of Health and Social Care which said it was \"urgently looking at options for tougher regulation\".",
      "It said our findings were \"shocking\" and that those caught \"dispensing medication without a licence should feel the full force of the law\".",
      "We attempted to put our allegations to Ricky Sawyer in person, by confronting him at his east London clinic.",
      "As soon as he saw the camera he tried to slam the door on us, before hiding behind it.",
      "We asked him if he was breaking the law by handing out prescription-only medicine, and if he had anything to say to the women who say they were left with such serious injuries that they needed emergency care.",
      "\"No,\" he said - and told us to leave.",
      "The dangers of unregulated cosmetic surgery should be taken far more seriously, says Ashton Collins.",
      "\"The general vibe that you pick up is that these are silly women that have made silly choices, driven through vanity, and it's their own fault.\"",
      "It is an attitude that needs to change, she adds: \"People are out there taking risks with people's lives, and they can do so with impunity.\"",

      "The company says it does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging.",
      "However, public logging records show Drax still sources whole trees from primary forests that are felled by other companies in the province, despite stating in its own sustainability criteria that the company will \"avoid damage or disturbance to high carbon forests\" which \"can be defined as primary forest\".",
      "Modern industrial logging only really began in the interior of British Columbia in the 1960s, which means the areas that have been logged and replanted in recent decades are not yet mature enough for these plantations to be harvested.",
      "Nearly all the industrial logging that takes place in the interior of the province is from \"woodland of native species where there is no clearly visible indication of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed\", the wording used by Ofgem to define primary forests.",
      "Drax was required to report to Ofgem that it had sourced wood from these areas but data obtained by the BBC through environmental information requests shows the company failed to declare any wood from primary forests in the sustainability data it submitted to the regulator regarding its Canadian wood pellets for the year 2020-21.",
      "That year Drax burned just over 1.2 million tonnes of wood pellets from Canada, with a significant proportion coming from primary forests in the interior of British Columbia.",
      "The company did not respond to the BBC's questions about why it had misreported its sustainability data and whether it had misled both the government and the energy regulator over its use of wood from primary forests.",
      "Drax appears to have since reduced its reliance on Canadian wood. The company said that only around 2.5% of pellets used at its power station in 2023 came from British Columbia, predominantly from public forests that have been designated for harvesting.",
      "The company said it \"recognises the importance of sustainably sourced biomass, and we work to ensure our pellets are legally harvested and meet the strict sustainability requirements of the UK, US, and Canadian governments, as well as those of the EU.\"",
      "The UK's current biomass sustainability criteria do not prohibit whole trees from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",
      "The company added that the misreporting previously identified by Ofgem was \"technical in nature\" and \"would not have impacted the levels of ROCs [subsidies] earned\".",
      "According to Ofgem, accurate sustainability data enables the government \"to understand and monitor the extent to which both primary forests and sawlogs are used in woody biomass, which has consequences for carbon emissions and biodiversity\".",
      "Following their investigation last year and Drax's subsequent \u00a325m penalty for misreporting data, the regulator Ofgem said it \"won't hesitate to act\" in the event of further wrong-doing.",
      "However, when approached by the BBC the regulator did not commit to any specific action relating to the further misreporting uncovered by the BBC.",
      "In a statement an Ofgem spokesperson said: \"We thank the BBC for sharing this information which relates to the same issue that was identified in our investigation into Drax.\"",
      "They added that Ofgem is making Drax \"conduct a full independent, external audit of its global supply chain profiling data to satisfy us appropriate processes and controls are in place for the future\" and added: \"If any additional evidence comes to light following the audit, we will investigate again.\"",
      "Drax's current renewable subsidies schemes come to an end in 2027 and the BBC's discovery of further misreporting of sustainability data by Drax comes as the government is expected to announce an extension of Drax's subsidies imminently.",
      "The government says it is carefully considering amending the current biomass sustainability criteria and will issue an update shortly but did not confirm whether it will prevent wood from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \"The situation we inherited for large scale biomass generators was unacceptable.",
      "\"Ofgem required a further audit to be undertaken and they are working closely with Drax to ensure any misreporting does not happen again.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2025 11:43:55 GMT",
    "summary": "As Peter Mandelson takes up the role of ambassador to the US, No 10 is determined the UK builds a strong relationship with Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "When Labour lost the 2010 election, rising star Ed Miliband was asked whether Peter Mandelson, who had just published a headline-grabbing autobiography, could play a role in the party's future.",
      "\"All of us,\" Miliband drily replied, \"believe in dignity in retirement.\"",
      "Mandelson winced and smiled at that quip, he later wrote. But ignored the advice.",
      "Fifteen years later, at the age of 71, the political veteran who helped mastermind Labour's renewal in the 1980s and 1990s, and was twice forced to resign from Tony Blair's government, has staged yet another comeback.",
      "\"It's a whirlwind,\" admits a member of his new team in Washington. \"Because he's a whirlwind kind of guy.\"",
      "The first political appointee to the role of UK ambassador to the United States in 50 years arrived in DC with a lot on his plate. Even by American standards.",
      "But why did Sir Keir Starmer recruit him, what explains Mandelson's hunger for the job, and how does he plan to charm Team Trump?",
      "\"Peter is supremely political,\" explains a Downing Street source. \"And this is a very political White House. He is a brilliant operator.\"",
      "Lord Mandelson has already moved into the ambassador's vast official residence, recently refurbished at a cost of \u00a3118.8m.",
      "His new life will involve more than Congressional meetings and cocktail parties. He now oversees 800 UK staff in the country many of whom are seconded to the Pentagon and defence bases.",
      "At the embassy, beneath a Warhol portrait of the late Queen, Mandelson has already hosted lunch for General Keith Kellogg, President Trump's envoy to Ukraine and Russia.",
      "This was merely a warm up for the real challenge later this month: accompanying Keir Starmer to the Oval Office to meet President Trump.",
      "My criticism of Trump was wrong, says Mandelson",
      "Peter Mandelson: How the Prince of Darkness became his excellency",
      "Peter Mandelson 'honoured' to be appointed US ambassador",
      "The new president may be erratic and impulsive yet No 10 officials are determined the two leaders will develop a strong relationship despite their differing personalities.",
      "\"The PM will be asking Peter: 'How on earth do I handle this crazy guy?',\" says a former colleague.",
      "\"As an ambassador in the court of Donald Trump you need someone who can tickle him under his chin. Peter will be the absolute fixer and bridge builder.\"",
      "Unlike the imminent turnover of leaders in continental Europe (Mandelson's long friendship with Emmanuel Macron is no longer so helpful), Starmer and Trump are likely to be in office and working together for the next four years.",
      "One official says part of the UK's pitch is about emphasising that both men are winners: \"Our message to him is we won big in July. You won big in November. Let's do business together.\"",
      "Mandelson has regularly provided advice to Keir Starmer in recent years and acted as an unofficial mentor to the PM's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and director of communications Matthew Doyle.",
      "These relationships suggest Downing Street and the US embassy will have an unusually close and constant level of contact.",
      "In an administration where billionaire businessmen have unprecedented influence, Peter Mandelson's contacts from his time as EU trade commissioner, UK business secretary, and via his international lobbying firm Global Counsel is already being deployed. \"He's essentially been a businessman for the last 15 years,\" says a source.",
      "In conversations with Trump, Mandelson could drop the names of numerous mutual friends: he knows Peter Thiel, the right-wing billionaire backer of vice president JD Vance, and Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, who is on the board of Meta.",
      "Mandelson has met Elon Musk, holidayed with Trump's new Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and built a relationship with Mark Burnett, the TV producer behind The Apprentice who is now Trump's special envoy to the UK.",
      "Yet Mandelson's expertise in charming these elites (former President George W. Bush nicknamed him 'Silvertongue'), and his penchant for luxury have also led to problems throughout his career.",
      "\"He has weaknesses,\" says one longtime friend. \"He likes the high life. A lifestyle he can't afford.\"",
      "Peter Mandelson's friendship with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska during his time at the EU provoked questions about conflicts of interest - Mandelson had stayed on Deripaska's yacht. The European Commission cleared him of wrongdoing.",
      "A name Mandelson will likely not drop in Trump's company is that of their late former friend Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Both knew the billionaire paedophile who died by suicide in 2019. Mandelson maintained a relationship with him even after Epstein signed a plea deal in 2008 and served an 18-month jail term for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14.",
      "Epstein is said to have referred to Mandelson as \"Petie\". Photographs released in court documents show Mandelson trying on a belt alongside Epstein in a clothing shop, and the pair blowing out candles on a birthday cake.",
      "Lord Mandelson has said he \"deeply regrets\" both ever meeting Epstein and the hurt caused to his many victims, and has also said that he never had any kind of professional or business relationship with him. But in an interview with the Financial Times this week, the diplomat also added: \"I'm not going to go into this\", and swore explosively at the interviewer.",
      "That undiplomatic language was a rare media misstep and contrasts with No 10's expectation that Mandelson will be a far safer pair of hands with journalists than his predecessor, outgoing ambassador Dame Karen Pierce.",
      "\"Karen just wasn't reliable enough for broadcast,\" one senior insider tells me. Starmer aides want Mandelson to regularly appear on US TV, including Trump's favoured channel Fox News.",
      "Dame Karen's glittering career as a diplomat may have meant she had less experience of television, but her expertise in national security and persistence in charming Trump's allies paid dividends.",
      "So much so that Donald Trump's co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita objected to Sir Keir replacing a \"professional universally respected ambo [ambassador] with an absolute moron\".",
      "Dame Karen stood out in the largely male and often stale world of Washington in her colourful tailor-made suits, occasionally complemented with a feather boa.",
      "As she packed her bags, at one farewell event she was presented with a commemorative champagne sabre engraved with the words \"always the Dame of DC\".",
      "Swapping a beltway bon vivant for the so-called Prince of Darkness is, however, a risk.",
      "Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts with clients of Mandelson's lobbying firm Global Counsel, which have included Shell and China-linked companies like TikTok. He resigned from Global Counsel's board last summer but remains a shareholder.",
      "Mandelson has already appeared on Fox News to apologise for his previous criticism of Donald Trump. He said his claims that the president was \"a bully\" were \"ill-judged and wrong\".",
      "Friends say the new ambassador is well aware that even before he arrived in the US capital he had other prominent detractors like Steve Bannon, Trump's former top adviser who called his appointment a \"terrible pick\".",
      "Mandelson's diplomatic strategy so far involves dividing Trumpworld into three groups and approaching them in different ways. The groups are: ideological MAGA (Trump's campaign mantra Make America Great Again), national security MAGA, and the technocracy.",
      "The first of these groups includes Bannon and may be the trickiest to mollify.",
      "\"They want to do as much damage as possible to Starmer and the UK/US relationship,\" says a diplomat. \"And they want to discredit Peter.\"",
      "Mandelson privately considers himself a foreign policy hawk so is more optimistic about his luck with group two: national security MAGA. These officials are more anti-Putin than others in the president's orbit, and they could be helpful when discussing policy on Ukraine, Russia and China.",
      "Group three - the technocracy - should also be open to the ambassador's advances. Mandelson wants the signature policy of his time in Washington to be a technological partnership involving AI and quantum computing.",
      "\"So Western nations and economies retain a technological edge over our adversaries,\" explains one involved.",
      "Before all that, the most pressing priority for the UK is avoiding trade tariffs.",
      "To help smooth the path, Mandelson's team have pointedly decided to frame their interactions with the White House in America First terms.",
      "\"We have a balanced trading relationship with America,\" insists one British diplomat.",
      "\"We'll be demonstrating where the UK partnership adds value to America not just saying 'this is good for Britain'.\"",
      "As the president floats unconventional and controversial ideas, one key UK tactic will be to simply stay out of the President's firing line.",
      "\"We're not getting involved,\" is a regular refrain from Downing Street.",
      "On Monday, Lord Mandelson will present his diplomatic credentials (a formal letter from King Charles) at the State Department.",
      "He is understood to already be planning how best to deploy his ultimate line manager with officials considering inviting the president on a second state visit to London.",
      "President Trump appeared to revel in a recent meeting with Prince William, who he said \"looks better in person\".",
      "Trump also insists, without evidence, he was Elizabeth II's favourite president.",
      "One minister jokes that when the prime minister visits the White House later this month he should take \"something from the Buckingham Palace gift shop\u2026 Maybe give Trump a royal family colouring-in book\".",
      "Forty years after he became Labour's director of research and communications, Peter Mandelson is back at the heart of British politics.",
      "As to why he still has the hunger for high office, one friend points to the four years he spent in the political wilderness after resigning from Tony Blair's government for the second time in 2001.",
      "That bruising experience, they argue, left him feeling unfulfilled and desperate to prove himself.",
      "\"He should have been foreign secretary,\" says the friend. \"Instead in those years he sat at home watching his contemporaries and intellectual inferiors on Newsnight.\"",
      "Another ally characterises Lord Mandelson's ambition in simpler terms: he has an insatiable thirst for power.",
      "\"Peter's great mission in life\", they say, \"is to stay relevant.\"",

      "\"So I think that there are many more people who want to work. I have no doubt, as there always have been, there are people who shouldn't be on those benefits who are taking the mickey and that is not good enough - we have to end that.\"",

      "Kendall said the DWP survey, which spoke to 3,401 benefit recipients, showed the need to reform the current welfare system and encourage young people to work if they can.",
      "The DWP secretary said: \"There is genuinely a problem with many young people, particularly the Covid generation, but we can't have a situation where doing a day's work is in itself seen as stressful.\"",
      "Kendall said supermarket managers had told her some young people did not understand work was \"just the nature of life and that isn't stress or pressure\".",
      "The DWP secretary is expected to present a policy paper on welfare reform next month.",

      "\"I was part of the decision-making process and the decision is as Rachel Reeves set it out,\" he said, adding he was \"not obfuscating\" when pressed on his previous stance and the fact he did not attend the chancellor's announcement on Heathrow.",
      "Collective responsibility is the rule that the Cabinet must act as one on government decisions.",
      "Miliband later told the Today programme a final decision on Heathrow expansion is \"some years off\", adding the proposal will need to meet carbon budgets and local environmental standards to be approved.",
      "\"I do support what the government is doing, which is that we've asked Heathrow to come forward with their plans,\" he told Sky News.",
      "\"But it's really important to say these have got to meet strict carbon budgets and local environmental standards and then an assessment will be made about whether a third runway can do that... We have carbon budgets in which any of those plans have to sit.\"",
      "Miliband attended a Cabinet away-day on Friday, where ministers discussed efforts to boost economic growth and reform public services.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves told colleagues Heathrow  was \"exactly the sort of model to boost growth for Britain and we need to move further and faster,\" according to a Downing Street statement.",
      "Those close to Miliband say there would be little point in resigning over Heathrow, given that a final decision is still some years away and there are pressing priorities within his portfolio, which he wants to address such as his commitment to clean energy.",
      "The energy secretary has also refused to state his personal position on the Rosebank oil field, another project he has previously opposed for environmental reasons.",
      "He argued that he has \"different responsibilities\" now as a government minister than he did in opposition, when he described the development as \"a colossal waste of taxpayer money\" and \"economic vandalism\".",
      "There will be a \"proper process\", he said, so the decision is made in a \"fair and objective\" manner.",
      "Neither were resignation issues, Miliband said, adding \"What I'm about is making a massive difference now - this is the fight of our time\".",
      "He said he \"utterly reject[s]\" that there is a choice between economic growth and net zero, arguing that clean energy provides \"the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century\" for jobs and the planet.",
      "On energy bills he said \"I fear bills will keep rising\" unless there was a transition to \"clean home grown power we control\".",
      "Miliband was also asked about the launch of a consultation on plans to ensure all rental properties have an energy performance certificate (EPC) rating of C or above.",
      "He accepted adding extra insulation to rented accommodation would increase bills for landlords, who may pass that cost onto tenants in the form of higher rents.",
      "However, Miliband said the move was the \"fair\" thing to do and was backed by tenants' associations worried about damp, mouldy homes and high energy bills.",

      "\"As of today, not a single one of those 20 recommendations is in place yet,\" said one survivor, Beverley Fenlon, although she welcomed Home Secretary Yvette Cooper's promise of a timetable by Easter saying \"we need progress reports and deadlines\".",

      "Champion said she was pleased the government has committed to \"taking forward\" all 20 of Prof Jay's recommendations - but called for the government to ring-fence funding for each of them.",
      "\"We must keep the pressure on, to ensure transparency and accountability are embedded throughout this process, with every recommendation fully adopted, and victims and survivors at its centre,\" she said.",
      "\"Ring-fenced funding for IICSA is essential - ensuring the money cannot be segued into other government priorities, and to send a clear message that the government is serious about implementation.",
      "\"Victims and survivors have too often seen past government pledges never materialise, or the same money being double or treble counted, ring-fencing stops that and hopefully starts to rebuild trust in the system.\"",
      "The group of survivors were joined by nearly 100 MPs and peers in parliament pledging to work across party lines to tackle the issue rather than fruitlessly \"kicking it about\" in party political rows.",
      "Beverley said she was left feeling \"frustrated and angry\" at recent political spats and another, Diane Ginn, said the years of arguing without action made her feel \"unheard and unrecognised\".",
      "Beverley added: \"We need to get this cross-party support in place instead of one party going after another because this is absolutely not a political football they can keep kicking about - these are our lives.\"",
      "Supporting the calls, Prof Jay said: \"We know of the appalling and lifelong effects that child sexual abuse can have on people.",
      "\"During IICSA, we set out what should be done to make sure children are better protected and now look forward to hearing the detail of the Government's timescale for delivering these recommendations, along with the necessary resourcing.\"",

      "The Bank of England has halved its growth forecast for this year as it cut interest rates to the lowest level for more than 18 months.",
      "The economy is now expected to grow by 0.75% in 2025, the Bank said, down from its previous estimate of 1.5%.",
      "The government has made growing the economy one of its key aims. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC he was \"not satisfied with growth\" and the downgraded forecast \"just spurs us on\".",
      "The new forecast came as the Bank cut interest rates to 4.5% from 4.75%. Its governor, Andrew Bailey, said that rates remain on a downward path.",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "Low growth and rising prices - it's looking gloomy for the UK",

      "\"We live in an uncertain world, and the road ahead will have bumps on it,\" he added.",
      "After the rates announcement, the pound slumped, before regaining ground.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bailey stressed that the Bank needs to remain \"gradual and careful\" when continuing to cut rates because \"there is a lot more uncertainty\" and because of the predicted rise in inflation.",
      "While it cut its growth forecast for this year, the Bank upgraded its predictions for both 2026 and 2027. The economy is now expected to grow by 1.5% in both of those years, the Bank said, up from 1.25%.",

      "\"There's no question that the increase in the cost of employment does have an effect,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We're very focused on how that increased cost of employment is going to pass through.\"",

      "He added that if the official government forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - changes its forecast in line with the Bank's then \"the chancellor is in big trouble\" when it comes to meeting her self imposed debt rules.",
      "\"That means... the tax revenues the chancellor is relying on are unlikely to come in as expected, and even tougher choices on spending and tax going forward.\"",
      "Mortgage impact",
      "The interest rate cut means that for the 629,000 homeowners on mortgage tracker deals that move in line with the base rate, there will typically be a \u00a329 fall in monthly repayments.",
      "The near 700,000 people on standard variable rate mortgages will have to wait to see if their lender responds.",
      "Those on a fixed mortgage deal will see no immediate change, but there might be cheaper deals available for new and renewing customers.",
      "However, the rate cut is likely to lead to lower returns for savers.",
      "Nicola Price and her husband John have still got 18 months remaining on their current mortgage deal, and welcome lower interest rates as it means they will pay less interest on their next mortgage - if rates remain low.",
      "Nicola wishes for \"certainly no more increases\" and thinks the sweet spot for her would be a rate of around 3%.",
      "However, the couple also see that falling interest rates aren't good news for everyone as their parents \"rely heavily\" on a better interest rate on their savings.",
      "In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank said economic growth had been \"broadly flat since March last year\".",

Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.",

      "Although there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "But Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.",
      "The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.",

      "Mirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.",

    "story": [
      "Former Plaid Cymru leader Lord Elis-Thomas, who has died aged 78, went from a maverick to a member of the political establishment.",
      "During a career that involved 12 years as the Welsh Assembly's first Presiding Officer, the equivalent of the Speaker of the House of Commons, he was never far from controversy and criticism.",
      "Sometimes the criticism came from his own party, particularly when he accepted a peerage and attacked Welsh language nationalism.",
      "Eventually he would quit Plaid Cymru and sit as an independent member in Cardiff Bay.",
      "Some might not have liked the way he held forth on controversial topics while holding an office that demanded neutrality.",
      "But he saw it as his job to stand up for a fledgling legislature - a job that sometimes needed an outspoken figure.",
      "Dafydd Elis-Thomas was born in Carmarthen in 1946, and educated at Llanrwst Grammar School and Bangor University.",
      "He led Plaid Cymru's youth section and campaigned against the 1969 investiture of Prince Charles in Caernarfon castle.",
      "'Baby of the house'",
      "In 1974 he was one of three Welsh nationalists elected to the House of Commons with Gwynfor Evans and Dafydd Wigley.",
      "At 27, he was the youngest member of that parliament - the \"baby of the house\".",
      "The other Dafydd beat him in a contest to lead Plaid when Mr Evans, a giant in the party, stood down in 1981.",
      "The battle for the succession was a battle to decide whether Plaid tacked to the left under Dafydd El or held a more moderate course under Dafydd Wigley.",
      "Following Mr Wigley's resignation, he was elected party president in October 1984, beating Dafydd Iwan, the candidate from the party's traditionalist wing.",
      "Under Lord Elis-Thomas's leadership, Plaid gave strong support to the miners in their strike of 1984 and won a third seat in parliament at the 1987 election.",
      "He stood down as an MP in 1992 and was ennobled as a cross-bench peer in the same year, despite his party's opposition to the Lords at the time.",
      "He served as chairman of the Welsh language board from 1994-99 before his election as Plaid Cymru Assembly member for Meirionydd Nant Conwy.",
      "He served as presiding officer of the Welsh Assembly, now called the Senedd, from 1999 to 2011, but the role did not stop him making headlines with his outspoken views.",
      "He clashed bitterly with the then first secretary Alun Michael in 2000 over procedures surrounding a no-confidence vote in Mr Michael's handling of European funding.",
      "He was an early advocate for a separation between the assembly and its executive - a divide that was finally enacted in the Government of Wales Act 2006.",
      "He ignited furious debate in 2001 when he said there was an anti-English feeling within Welsh language nationalism and there was no such thing as a Welsh-speaking heartland.",
      "He was known for a memorable turn of phrase, such as this take on a row about where assembly members sit in the chamber: \"What is the point of getting up in the morning, cleaning my teeth, washing and shaving if you go to work in an institution like this.\"",
      "He pushed for a more powerful assembly, calling for the devolution of control over policing and broadcasting.",
      "He intervened in a spat between Westminster and Cardiff Bay about devolving powers over housing policy, accusing some Welsh MPs of \"acting contrary to the spirit of devolution\".",
      "Not everyone appreciated his style.",
      "Despite having neighbouring offices during the second assembly, he and former deputy presiding officer John Marek barely spoke after rowing about a departing official.",
      "He called for assembly members to boycott a meeting with the Israeli ambassador, organised by the assembly's only Muslim AM,.",
      "In 2011 he provoked a furious reaction from Labour and the Conservatives when he said the Wales Office should be scrapped in the wake of the referendum to give the assembly direct law-making powers.",
      "Soon after, he let it be known he would enter the contest to succeed outgoing Plaid leader Ieuan Wyn Jones.",
      "Twenty years after he vacated the role of party president, it was a typically provocative move from one of Welsh politics' most colourful characters.",
      "That contest was won by Leanne Wood, who Elis-Thomas went on to clash with over the direction of Plaid Cymru.",
      "In 2016 he quit the party to sit as an independent member in Cardiff Bay.",
      "He said it was because Plaid Cymru was not \"serious\" about taking part in the Labour-led Welsh government.",
      "Later he was appointed deputy minister for tourism, sport and culture in that government, led by Carwyn Jones, a role he continued when Mark Drakeford took over in late 2018.",

    "story": [
      "Landlords will be forced to investigate and fix damp and mould in social housing in England within strict timescales from October, the government has announced.",
      "Campaigners had called for the reforms after two-year-old Awaab Ishak died from mould exposure at his Rochdale home in 2020.",
      "However, the implementation of the changes - known as Awaab's law - will be phased, with timeframes for other hazards, such as structural and electrical issues, not introduced until 2026 at the earliest.",

      "'I fear my mould-infested flat is going to kill me'",
      "Government plans to force landlords to tackle mould",
      "From October, social landlords - generally the local council or a housing association - will also be required to repair all emergency hazards within 24 hours.",
      "Timescales for investigating other hazards will be set out in the government's response to a consultation, at a later date.",
      "However, previous proposals under the Conservatives suggested social landlords should be required to investigate and provide a timeline for repair within 14 days of being made aware of the hazard.",
      "Under those proposals, if there is a significant risk to health or safety repair works must begin within 7 days.",
      "Landlords who fail to comply face being taken to court and ordered to pay compensation.",
      "In a written ministerial statement, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the phased approach allowed protections from damp and mould to be brought in earlier and enabled an initial period of testing to ensure the changes were implemented effectively.",
      "In 2026, timeframes for non-emergency repairs will apply to a wider range of hazards including excess cold and heat, structural collapse, fire, electrical faults and hygiene hazards.",
      "Then in 2027, this will be expanded to the remaining hazards listed in regulations, excluding overcrowding.",
      "The government stressed that this \"in no way means that social landlords have any leeway when it comes to meeting their existing duties to address dangers to health and safety present in their homes\".",
      "Social landlords already have a duty to keep their homes fit for human habitation and free of hazards.",
      "Awaab's law was first passed in July 2023 under the previous Conservative government but has not yet been brought into force.",
      "Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said the latest announcement \"means social housing tenants will have to wait years longer for this vital protection\".",
      "She added: \"The government must make good on their promise and fully and swiftly implement Awaab's Law.\"",
      "Kate Henderson, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said the sector was \"committed to ensuring the failures that led to the tragic death of Awaab Ishak never happen again and that all homes are free from serious hazards\".",
      "However, she said housing associations were facing \"unprecedented financial pressures\" and issues such as overcrowding, which contribute to damp and mould, \"can only be solved through funding for new social homes\".",
      "The government is also planning to extend Awaab's law to the private rented sector in the Renters' Rights Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament.",
      "Ministers have previously said they hope the law will be passed by the summer.",
      "Damp problems are more prevalent in privately rented homes, with 9% of homes affected, compared to 7% of social housing in 2023, according to the English Housing Survey.",
      "Rayner, who is also housing secretary, said: \"We have a moral duty to ensure tragedies like the death of Awaab Ishak never happen again.",
      "\"Landlords cannot be allowed to rent out dangerous homes and shamelessly put the lives of their tenants at risk.\"",

      "\"We understand it's unsafe but if it's out of sight, it will be definitely be out of mind for those responsible for the tragic deaths,\" she said.",

      "The reorganisation \u2013 which ministers say will make councils simpler and more efficient, and make mayors champions for their regions \u2013 will also see local elections in nine areas postponed for a year.",

      "In some places there is disagreement over how councils should be re-structured, how many people they should serve, what the geographical boundaries should be and whether some councils might have to take on other councils' financial burdens - and all this is happening at a time when many local authorities are struggling to balance budgets.",

      "One senior Tory councillor said: \"You need economies of scale for housing, transport, schools and roads rather than what happens now, which is people don't know where to go if their bins aren't collected, and they don't know which council does what \u2013 this is a much more simple and hopefully cheaper way of providing services.\"",

      "Some believe the pushback is being driven by politics from those who stand to lose out on council seats.",
      "\"I think it's people in the bubble talking to themselves,\" one council leader said. \"This is about politics, nothing more.\"",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has been unclear about whether he will impose tariffs on the UK but  economists warn there are still ways Britain could be negatively affected by the president's wider trade policies even if it avoids being hit directly.",
      "The impact could be felt through slower growth in some of the UK's important trading partners. Industrial exports could be diverted from the US and flood the UK market and there could be impacts on our financial markets, including a possible increase to borrowing costs.",
      "Asked about future tariffs, Trump told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The UK is way out of line but I'm sure that one\u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "The president did not specify in which way he regarded the UK as being \"out of line\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given for imposing tariffs on countries is they have a trade surplus with the US - in other words they sell more to the US than they import from America.",
      "He has claimed these trade surpluses amount to \"massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico\".",
      "The tariffs on Mexico were paused for a month by Trump on Monday but the president has complained about unbalanced trade with the EU, saying on Sunday: \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products.\"",
      "So one way the UK might be seen to be out of line in the mind of Trump - and at risk of tariffs - is if Britain was also running a trade surplus with America.",
      "Does the UK have a trade surplus with the US?",
      "The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the UK had a surplus of around \u00a371bn in trade with the US in 2023, the most recent full year for which we have data.",
      "But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn.",
      "How can both be true?",
      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers.",
      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",
      "\"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop.",
      "\"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\"",

      "In October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.",
      "But on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.",
      "What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change?",
      "Nearly \u00a322bn pledged for carbon capture projects",
      "What does net zero mean?",

      "The UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.",
      "But a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.",
      "Both the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "By 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.",
      "The funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.",

      "The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.",

    "title": "Record January warmth puzzles climate scientists",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 03:10:59 GMT",
    "summary": "January was expected to be cooler than the same month last year, but was 0.1C warmer, which experts are struggling to explain.",
    "story": [
      "Last month was the world's warmest January on record raising further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists say.",
      "January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.",
      "The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.",
      "It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected.",
      "\"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News.",
      "\"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\"",
      "January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.",
      "Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.",
      "This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.",
      "While La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.",
      "\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.",
      "\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.",
      "One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.",
      "But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.",
      "\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.",
      "The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"",
      "Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.",
      "These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.",
      "But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.",
      "And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.",
      "Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.",
      "The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.",
      "This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.",
      "Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.",
      "What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.",
      "\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.",
      "\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to \"build baby build\", as he announced plans to make it easier to construct mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales.",
      "The prime minister told the BBC the government was going to \"take on the blockers\" and change planning rules so new reactors could be built in more parts of the country.",
      "Sir Keir said he wanted the country to return to being \"one of the world leaders on nuclear\", helping to create thousands of highly skilled jobs and boosting economic growth.",
      "Unions and business groups welcomed the move, but some environmentalists criticised the government, saying it had \"swallowed nuclear industry spin whole\".",
      "Currently, progress building nuclear power stations in the UK can be slow - to get from planning to \"power on\" can take nearly 20 years.",
      "Speaking on a visit to the UK National Nuclear Laboratory in Lancashire, Sir Keir said the process was too long and that changes announced by the government would speed it up.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason if \"build baby build\" was his mantra like US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\", Sir Keir said: \"I say build baby build. I say we're going to take on the blockers so that we can build.\"",
      "He said the government had already changed the rules to allow onshore wind farms and was now acting to ensure \"we can fast forward on nuclear\".",
      "Pressed over whether people who live near nuclear infrastructure could get money off their electricity bills, the prime minister said while this was not part of the announcement the government had already backed the idea of benefits for local communities hosting energy infrastructure.",
      "In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with no new power stations built since then and many of the country's ageing reactors due to be decommissioned over the next decade.",
      "Mini nuclear power stations - or small modular reactors (SMRs) - are smaller and cheaper than traditional nuclear power plants, and produce much less power.",
      "However, while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",

      "The process of choosing to loosen rules on where nuclear reactors could be built began under Rishi Sunak's Conservative government with a consultation in January 2024.",
      "Ministers said Britain is considered one of the world's most expensive countries in which to build nuclear power, and a new Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce will be established to speed up the approval of new reactor designs and stream line how developers engage with regulators.",
      "Conservative shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie said it was \"about time\" Labour followed his party's lead in recognising the benefits \"of stable, reliable, baseload nuclear power\".",
      "But Doug Parr, policy director of Greenpeace UK, claimed the government had not applied \"so much as a pinch of critical scrutiny or asking for a sprinkling of evidence\".",
      "\"The Labour government has swallowed [the] nuclear industry spin whole,\" he said, adding: \"They present as fact things which are merely optimistic conjecture on small nuclear reactor cost, speed of delivery and safety.\"",
      "While the overall cost of nuclear power is comparable with other forms of energy, nuclear plants are extremely expensive to build.",
      "The head of the Nuclear Industry Association, Tom Greatrex, said the changes would give investors certainty and enable them to get on with building new plants.",

      "The Santorini resident fears the impact of ongoing earthquakes on the Greek island, popular with tourists for its picture-postcard views.",
      "But the idyll has been disrupted this past week by thousands of earthquakes.",
      "Santorini, and other Greek islands in the region, are in the middle of an \"unprecedented\" seismic swarm or crisis - the name for an abrupt increase in earthquakes in a particular area.",
      "About three-quarters of the island's 15,000 population have evacuated while authorities declared a state of emergency after a 5.2 magnitude quake, the largest yet, rocked the island on Wednesday.",
      "Further, albeit smaller quakes, were felt again on Thursday.",
      "The \"clusters\" of quakes have puzzled scientists who say such a pattern is unusual because they have not been linked to a major shock. So what's going on?",

      "Experts agree the island is experiencing what Greece's prime minister has called an \"extremely and intricate geological phenomenon\".",
      "\"It is really unprecedented, we have never seen something like this before in [modern times] in Greece,\" says Dr Athanassios Ganas, research director of the National Observatory of Athens.",
      "Santorini lies on the Hellenic Volcanic Arc - a chain of islands created by volcanoes.",
      "But it has not seen a major eruption in recent times, in fact not since the 1950s, so the reason for the current crisis is unclear.",
      "Experts say they're seeing many earthquakes within a relatively small area, which don't fit the pattern of a mainshock-aftershock sequence, says Dr Ganas.",
      "He said this began with the awakening of a volcano on Santorini last summer. Then in January there was a \"surge\" of seismic activity with smaller earthquakes being recorded.",
      "That activity has escalated in the past week.",
      "Thousands of earthquakes have been recorded since Sunday, with Wednesday's the most significant yet.",
      "\"We are in the middle of a seismic crisis,\" Dr Gasnas said.",
      "Dr Margarita Segou from the British Geological Survey described the quakes as happening every day \"in pulses\".",
      "She says this \"swarm-like behaviour\" means that when a more significant  earthquake strikes, for example a magnitude four, the \"seismicity is increased for one to two hours, and then the system relaxes again\".",
      "How much longer will this seismic activity last?",
      "In short, it is impossible to tell. There are hopes that Wednesday's quake, which struck at night, will be the biggest one to hit the island.",
      "But seismologists have told the BBC it is difficult to be sure. Authorities have warned the activity could go on for weeks.",
      "Experts also do not know whether this chain of quakes are foreshocks leading up to a large earthquake or their own event.",
      "Professor Joanna Faure Walker, an earthquake geology expert at UCL's Institute of Disaster Risk Reduction, said some large earthquakes do experience foreshocks - elevated levels of small to moderate seismic events - before the main shock.",
      "But what is happening now are not volcanic earthquakes, say Dr Ganas. Volcanic earthquakes have a characteristic signature of low frequency wave forms and these have not been exhibited here.",
      "Dr Segou told the BBC she and colleagues had analysed previous earthquakes in the region with machine learning - a data analysis method able to make predictions - to learn how earthquakes in the region in 2002 and 2004 came to an end.",
      "The magnitude of those earthquakes were not as intense as the ones felt now she said. But the \"signatures\" of how they started and ended could help build a picture of what patterns to look out for.",

      "Hundreds of carbonised scrolls were discovered in Herculaneum, which like its neighbour Pompeii was buried beneath metres of volcanic ash.",
      "In the past, some of the documents, which are made from a thick paper-like material called papyrus, were prised open but they crumbled into pieces.",
      "The University of Oxford's Bodleian Library holds several of the scrolls. Thought to be unreadable, they had been left untouched for decades.",
      "\"We've never been convinced before that any of the techniques would be safe enough or effective enough to get any information from the scrolls,\" explained Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation.",

      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimetre,\" explained Adrian Mancuso, director of physical sciences at Diamond.",
      "The scan is used to create a 3D reconstruction, then the layers inside the scroll - it contains about 10m of papyrus - have to be identified.",
      "\"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally,\" said Dr Mancuso.",
      "After that artificial intelligence is used to detect the ink. It's easier said than done - both the papyrus and ink are made from carbon and they're almost indistinguishable from each other.",
      "So the AI hunts for the tiniest signals that ink might be there, then this ink is painted on digitally, bringing the letters to light.",

      "The government's idea of re-designating areas as \"grey belt\" land in its bid to build more homes is \"largely redundant\", a House of Lords committee has said.",
      "Ministers had said that, if a council's housing targets could not be met, some protected land known as green belt would be re-labelled grey belt and thereby freed up for development.",
      "However, after conducting an inquiry the committee said it suspected the grey belt concept had been \"eclipsed by more significant changes\" made by the government.",
      "A government spokesperson said its changes to the green belt were \"just one of the ambitious housing reforms we have set out to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth\".",
      "They added that the measures were \"informed through widespread consultation and will unlock more land for the homes and infrastructure communities desperately need, delivering sustainable, affordable and well-designed developments on low quality grey belt\".",
      "Since coming to power in July, the Labour government has said it wants to build 1.5 million homes over the next five years and has identified \"poor quality\" green belt land as possible areas of construction.",

      "Under the new rules, building on green belt land will be be allowed if other options have been exhausted, the government has said.",
      "\"It is difficult to see what the grey belt regime will add in terms of the ability to build on the green belt in light of this requirement,\" Lord Moylan said.",

    "summary": "The asteroid named YR4 has a 1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032",
    "story": [
      "UN planetary defence organisations are closely monitoring an asteroid that has a tiny risk of hitting the Earth.",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) has said that it has an almost 99% chance of safely passing Earth on 22 December 2032, but a possible impact \"cannot yet be entirely ruled out\".",
      "The probability that the asteroid, called 2024 YR4, may impact Earth on 22 December 2032 is currently estimated to be 1.3%.",
      "Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society, says that he is \"not panicking or losing sleep over it\".",
      "\"There is no need for alarm,\" he said. \"The thing about this kind of event is that historically they tend to go away when the calculations are refined.\"",
      "We need to be aware alert and we need to give astronomers the resources they need to track these kinds of threats so that we can take action as soon as possible.\"",
      "YR4 was detected on 27 December 2024. Astronomers calculated that it was between 40m and 90m across. This would have the power of a nuclear bomb were it to hit the Earth and cause severe damage if the impact was in a populated area.",
      "But it is much more likely that YR4 would fall into the ocean or a remote part of the planet. It is too far away from Earth and there are too many uncertainties at this stage to determine where a potential impact could occur in the unlikely event of a collision.",
      "Since early January, astronomers have been using telescopes to calculate the asteroid's size and trajectory more precisely. YR4 is now rated at level 3 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale: \"a close encounter that warrants attention from astronomers and the public\". A collision is only certain when it reaches 8, 9 or 10, with the numbers rising in line with the damage likely caused.",
      "When asteroids are initially calculated to have a small probability of hitting the Earth, that impact probability usually drops to zero after additional observations.",
      "This happened in 2004 when an asteroid called Apophis was calculated to have a 2.7% chance of striking Earth in 2029; further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "Any object that may be more than 50m wide and has a greater than 1% chance of hitting the Earth, triggers a set of precautionary measures. These are to ensure that the threat, however tiny, is closely monitored and, if necessary, steps are taken to nullify it.",
      "The first stage is to activate two UN-endorsed asteroid reaction groups: the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), chaired by Nasa, and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), chaired by the European Space Agency.",
      "The SMPAG is having a series of meetings this week to determine its next steps.  It has already concluded that it is too early to take immediate action but said that it would \"monitor the evolution of impact threat and possible knowledge about the size closely\".",
      "Another meeting to take decisions on future activities will be held towards the end of April or early May, or earlier, \"if the evolution of the threat merits\".",
      "If the asteroid's impact probability remains above the 1% threshold, SMPAG will provide recommendations to the UN and may begin to evaluate options.",
      "In the unlikely event YR4 were headed our way, one option would be to divert it by hitting it with a robotic spacecraft, as was successfully tested out with Nasa's Dart mission in 2022. That changed the course of an asteroid that was not on a collision course with the Earth.",
      "\"Nasa's Dart mission showed that we have the means to divert an asteroid, but only if we spot it early enough,\" says Dr Massey.",
      "YR4 is currently moving away from Earth in almost a straight line, making it difficult to accurately determine its precise orbit before it returns towards Earth.",
      "Over the next few months, the asteroid will begin to fade from view, after which  it will be monitored by ground and space telescopes.",
      "According to ESA \"It is possible that asteroid 2024 YR4 will fade from view before we are able to entirely rule out any chance of impact in 2032. In this case, the asteroid will likely remain on ESA's risk list until it becomes observable again in 2028.\""

    "story": [
      "At the head of beautiful Loch Long in Argyll sits one of Scotland's biggest plastic problems.",
      "A combination of prevailing winds and the rotation of the earth drive litter up the loch to create what is known as the Arrochar litter sink.",
      "About 62,000 items wash up on the beach each year, much of it from the waterways in and around Glasgow, Scotland\u2019s largest city.",
      "It is estimated that 11% of the rubbish which enters the River Clyde - which flows through the city - and its tributaries is eventually washed up at Arrochar.",
      "The local residents can't clean it up fast enough.",
      "Lots of the waste is tangled in the seaweed which was once an asset to the community.",
      "It used to be collected by the bucketload to fertilise farm land, but that's no longer possible because of the pollution.",
      "Campaigners say the only solution is to stop the waste entering the water in the first place - and that the introduction of a deposit return scheme for bottles and cans would play a major role in doing just that.",
      "A Scottish scheme was originally meant to be operational by 2023 but was delayed after objections from businesses to the inclusion of glass.",
      "It then emerged that the UK government was considering blocking Scotland's plans because it wanted a single scheme for all four nations.",
      "UK ministers eventually decided they would grant an exemption - but only if glass was taken out of the Scottish plans to align it with the scheme it was planning to introduce in England.",
      "That position led to angry recriminations and eventually an announcement from Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater of a further delay until at least October 2025.",
      "That was later extended to 2027, in line with the UK scheme.",
      "But in December, the Welsh government confirmed it was opting out of the UK-wide proposition and creating its own scheme - which would include glass recycling.",
      "In the meantime, a deposit return scheme has been successfully launched in the Republic of Ireland which has captured almost a billion items in its first year.",
      "All of these political rows have been frustrating to people who just want to see the marine environment free of litter.",
      "Kirsty Crawford from the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) says it's vital for places like Arrochar that the current target date of 2027 is not pushed back again.",
      "She said: \"With each fresh high tide you're going to get more litter washing in.",
      "\"It is a big task at hand but this is where we hope the deposit return scheme would help see a reduction in that problem.\"",
      "The scheme in Ireland went live a year ago and more than 900 million items have so far been returned to shops.",
      "Consumers have to pay a deposit of 15 cents for every standard-sized plastic bottle or can which is purchased. The deposit is refunded when the item is returned.",
      "Glass is not included in the scheme.",
      "Some retailers were initially resistant, but others say it has led to an increase in footfall in shops.",
      "Reverse vending machines can cost shop owners about \u20ac15,000 (\u00a312,500), but stores do have the option of collecting returned items over the counter.",
      "Environmental group Coastwatch Europe, which monitors more than 500 stretches of shore in Ireland, says the scheme is already having a significant impact.",
      "Seven years ago volunteers were recording around 60 bottles per kilometre of beach - but a survey in September and October found an average of eight per kilometre.",
      "Co-founder Karin Dubsky believes that's not just down to the deposit return scheme but also a broader appreciation of the impact of plastic pollution.",
      "\u201dThere is so much positivity and I think it has opened the gates to a different kind of thinking,\u201d she said.",
      "Politicians hope a deposit return scheme scheme will boost Scotland\u2019s stubborn household recycling figures, which have barely budged for a decade.",
      "In 2023, 43.5% of household waste was recycled, compared with 42.9% in 2014.",
      "The Scottish government says it expects the scheme to reduce littering by a third and increase recycling of single-use drinks containers to 90%.",
      "Lorna Slater, the Scottish Greens minister who introduced the scheme during her time in government, says she hopes glass can still ultimately be included in the scheme.",
      "But she says it\u2019s most important that there are no further delays to its rollout.",
      "That view is echoed by environmental charities like the MCS and Keep Scotland Beautiful.",

      "The parents believe their children died after taking part in a viral trend that circulated on the video-sharing platform in 2022.",
      "TikTok says it prohibits dangerous content and challenges. It has blocked searches for videos and hashtags related to the particular challenge the children's parents say is linked to their deaths.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the US on Thursday, claims that Isaac Kenevan, 13, Archie Battersbee, 12, Julian \"Jools\" Sweeney, 14, and Maia Walsh, 13, died while attempting the so-called \"blackout challenge\".",
      "The complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware by the US-based Social Media Victims Law Center on behalf of Archie's mother Hollie Dance, Isaac's mum Lisa Kenevan, Jools' mother Ellen Roome and Maia's dad Liam Walsh.",

      "Back in the 1990s, when creator Will Wright pitched the game to his bosses, they weren't convinced by his idea of a \"virtual dollhouse\".",
      "A so-called life simulator where players design their own characters, give them personalities and tend to their needs.",
      "Who wants that?",
      "Quite a lot of people, it turns out.",
      "Now, 25 years from its debut, The Sims is one of the best-selling video game series of all time, with an active community of superfans known as Simmers.",
      "The latest instalment, The Sims 4, has been translated into 18 languages and played by 85 million people worldwide, according to publisher Electronic Arts.",
      "The original game's open-ended nature helped it to become a hit and reach so-called \"casual gamers\" outside the medium's more dedicated audience.",
      "Players had the freedom to carefully craft a detailed domestic setting for their digital people, managing their love lives, daily routines, basic needs and hobbies in exacting detail.",
      "But it also allowed them to imagine various torments for their virtual pals. One of the most famous - stranding your Sim in a swimming pool without a ladder - remains a popular meme to this day.",
      "UK-based streamer Jesse, best known as Plumbella, says she became obsessed with the legendary trick when she first played the game at five years old.",
      "The Sims has been part of Jesse\u2019s life ever since, thanks, she says, to the community around it.",
      "Players can create modifications or \"mods\" that alter different elements from the way the game plays to a character's appearance.",
      "Extra height options, having multiple jobs and neurodivergent personality traits are among some of the popular fan-made add-ons.",
      "For dedicated fans, Jesse says, the longevity comes from building on each other's creations.",
      "As she puts it: \"Take something and customise it and share it with other Simmers.",
      "\"It's really interesting to see the ways that people can come up with to use their game in an interesting way.\"",
      "The ability to express yourself in The Sims also made it a popular title among its many players from diverse communities.",
      "Even at its launch in 2000, The Sims included same-sex relationships at a time when choices around sexuality or identity in gaming were rare.",
      "Creator Mollie, who streams as TheEnglishSimmer, makes a lot of LGBT-themed content for her channel.",
      "She says developer Maxis has \"always been kind of a spearhead in the gaming industry when it comes to telling diverse stories and wanting to show that representation\".",

      "\"But the difference between The Sims and other games is I can do something about it.\"",
      "Amira's Melanin Pack was a hit when it was released, and she's since worked with Maxis and Electronic Arts on officially adopting more skin tones into the game.",
      "\"For me that's a big part of why I've played the game for so long,\" she says.",

      "Zoe Delahunty-Light, a video producer at website Eurogamer, commends The Sims for making \"great strides\" with diversity and working with creators to build authentic representation into the game.",
      "But she does point out that much of the work was done first, for free, by modders.",
      "The official Lovestruck add-on, Zoe says, introduces polyamorous relationships to the game and costs \u00a330 ($37).",
      "\"So it can feel like it is squeezing as much money as it can out of people who desire representation the most, which is pretty audacious,\" she says.",
      "The game has also been criticised over a lack of inclusion for players with disabilities, both in their ability to modify its controls and see themselves on screen.",
      "\"The game still lacks the option to change key binds, which is a basic accessibility issue,\" says Zoe.",
      "Developer Maxis has previously said it's discussing the introduction of more accessibility features to the game.",

      "The tech industry has followed suit, with companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, scrapping its DEI efforts and also cutting moderation teams.",
      "There's a question over whether this could impact gaming, where companies are often criticised for failing to adequately tackle racial and gender-based harassment on their platforms.",
      "\"The bigger concern is that this will be seen as a green light for certain groups of toxic gamers to become more open about their own hateful views, making inclusive spaces more important than ever,\" says Zoe.",

    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

      "He is the man tipped to be Germany's next leader: an antidote to Europe's crisis of confidence, say his supporters.",
      "Friedrich Merz is a familiar face of his conservative party's old guard. Politically, he has never come across as exhilarating.",
      "And yet his explosive bid to tighten migration rules with the support of far-right votes in parliament reveals a man willing to gamble by breaking a major taboo.",
      "It also marks yet another clear break from his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party's more centrist stance under his former party rival Angela Merkel.",
      "Although Merz ultimately failed to change the law, he had launched a lightning bolt into an election campaign triggered by the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government late last year.",
      "Famously sidelined by Merkel before she became chancellor, he quit parliament entirely to pursue a lucrative series of corporate jobs and was written off as yesterday's man.",
      "But there is a sense of inevitability that this 69-year-old comeback kid might be on the cusp of clinching the job he has coveted for so long.",
      "It is 23 January, one month until Germany's snap federal election, and people have gathered in one of Berlin's five-star hotels to hear Merz give a foreign policy speech.",
      "The buzz around the \"ballroom\" in the Hotel de Rome isn't exactly electric - but it is a far cry from 20 years ago, when his political career looked over.",
      "Merz is also a licensed pilot, who drew criticism in 2022 for flying to the north German island of Sylt in his private plane for the wedding of fellow politician Christian Lindner.",
      "As he takes to the stage in the Hotel de Rome, there's polite applause for the leader of Germany's conservative CDU opposition, who are consistently ahead in the polls.",
      "Tall, slim, in a suit and glasses, Merz cuts a calm, conventional, business-like figure as he tries to project a readiness for power.",
      "But it has been a winding journey to get to this point.",
      "Merz was born in the west German town of Brilon in 1955 into a prominent conservative, Catholic family.",

      "The younger Merz joined the CDU while still at school.",
      "In an interview 25 years ago with the German newspaper Tagesspiegel he laid claim to a wilder youth than his strait-laced CV might suggest.",
      "Among his misadventures, he described racing through the streets on a motorcycle, hanging out with friends by a chip stand and playing the card game Doppelkopf in the back of the class.",
      "A teenage party he referenced ended up with a group of students taking a collective pee in the school aquarium, according to Der Spiegel magazine.",
      "There is some scepticism that the teenage Merz was much of a rabble-rouser. A former classmate recalled that the young Friedrich's disruptive behaviour more often amounted to simply wanting \"the last word\".",
      "Whether on or off the record, people who have known him have told me he enjoys a beer and can indeed be fun, though few were able to offer an anecdote to illustrate this.",
      "Who's who in German elections and why this vote is important",
      "After school, he went on to military service before studying law and marrying fellow student Charlotte Gass in 1981.",
      "The couple have three children.",
      "For a few years, Merz worked as a lawyer but he always had his eye on politics and was elected to the European Parliament in 1989, aged 33.",
      "\"We were both quite young and very fresh and let's say unspoilt,\" says Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, who became an MEP at the same time for the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).",
      "She found the young Merz to be serious, reliable, honest and polite.",
      "Even humorous \u2013 a quality that she feels is less obvious now: \"I assume the amount of bruises over time might have hardened him a bit.\"",
      "But did he come across early in his career as a potential chancellor?",
      "\"I would have probably have said no, no way. Come on, you must be kidding!\"",
      "Yet everyone knew him to be deeply ambitious and Merz soon made the switch from EU politics to Germany's national parliament, the Bundestag, in 1994.",
      "He rose through the ranks, touted as a talent on the party's more right-wing, traditionalist faction.",
      "\"He's a splendid speaker and a profound thinker,\" says Klaus-Peter Willsch, a CDU member of the Bundestag who has known him for more than 30 years.",
      "\"A fighter,\" says Willsch, evidenced by the fact that Merz made three attempts to lead his party.",
      "His first two failures, in 2018 and January 2021, could also be read as a sign of his struggle to woo the grassroots.",
      "But it was back in the early noughties, when his ambitions were initially derailed, that he lost out to Angela Merkel in a party power struggle.",
      "Merkel, the understated quantum chemist from the former communist east, and Merz, the overtly-assured lawyer from the west, never much saw eye-to-eye.",
      "Merz glosses over this bitter episode in a brief autobiographical post on the CDU website, saying that by 2009 he had decided to leave parliament to \"make room for reflection\".",
      "His years of reflection involved forging a career in finance and corporate law \u2013 becoming a boardroom executive at various international firms and, reputedly, a millionaire.",
      "It would be more than a decade before he returned to parliament, where he has since sought to rip up Merkel's more centrist doctrine on CDU conservatism.",
      "A marked moment of political severance came at the end of last month, when Friedrich Merz pushed through a non-binding motion on tougher immigration rules, by relying on votes from the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD).",
      "He insisted there had been no direct collaboration with the AfD, but his move led to mass protests and has twice been condemned by none other than Merkel herself.",
      "These are rare public interventions by the woman who ruled Germany for 16 years.",
      "Detractors say it was an unforgivable election gambit that will only benefit the AfD, but supporters insist Merz is, in fact, seeking to lure people cleverly from the far right.",
      "He has risked alienating more moderate parts of the electorate before, voting in the 1990s against a bill that included the criminalisation of marital rape.",
      "He later explained that he considered marital rape to already be a crime, and it was other issues in the bill that he objected to.",
      "Polls suggest he is not especially popular among young people and women - but Klaus-Peter Willsch believes the picture painted of him in German media is unfair.",
      "\"I had him several times in my constituency,\" he tells me. \"Afterwards, women come up and say he's a nice guy.\"",
      "Charlotte Merz has likewise come to his defence, telling the Westfalenpost: \"What some people write about my husband's image of women is simply not true.\"",
      "She says their marriage has been one of mutual support: \"We both took care of each other's jobs and divided the childcare in such a way that it was compatible with our professional obligations.\"",
      "His popularity will be put to the test as the election approaches, and also as speculation focuses less on whether they will win and more on who they might form a coalition with.",
      "Some observers fear trust among potential coalition partners has been damaged by Merz's experimental approach to tacit collaboration with the AfD \u2013 a party he insists he will never govern with.",

This would be a devastating hit even for institutions with large endowments.\u201d",

      "\"Development wins, good governance triumphs,\" Modi wrote on X, adding his party would leave \"no stone unturned\" in developing Delhi .",
      "In a video message on X, the AAP's former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said he and his party \"humbly accepted\" the verdict of the people and congratulated the BJP on its win.",
      "\"I hope they live up to the expectations of the people who voted for them,\" he said.",
      "The election was a battle of prestige for both the BJP and AAP, given Delhi's symbolic importance as the country's capital.",
      "The city, a federally-administered territory, had been governed by the AAP since 2013, with voters backing its strong record of welfarism. But the party and its leaders have faced several challenges recently, with leaders embroiled in corruption allegations which they have denied.",
      "For the BJP, securing Delhi represents more than just electoral success - it marks a crucial foothold in the nation's capital after being out of power there since 1998.",
      "The party threw resources at the Delhi campaign, with Modi as well as Home Minister Amit Shah attending events.",
      "Congress, the main opposition party at the national level, was also in the race, but did not win even one seat.",
      "The party governed Delhi from 1998 to 2013, but was ousted over allegations of corruption that saw voters turn to AAP instead. It has failed to make a mark since.",
      "Experts say the win in politically crucial Delhi will reinforce Modi's popularity among Indian voters after his party lost its outright majority in last year's general election.",
      "The defeat is a big blow to the AAP, a much smaller party praised in its early years in power for focusing on improving education and health facilities in the city. It also governs Punjab state, but retaining Delhi would have been a triumph for the beleaguered party now facing questions about its future.",
      "After more than a decade in power in Delhi, AAP's appeal has waned, especially among the middle-class, which was once drawn to Kejriwal's anti-corruption stance. Kejriwal, once a champion of the middle-class-led anti-corruption movement, had pivoted to becoming the party of the poor - it is not yet clear when the poor and Delhi's struggling working class abandoned him.",
      "Corruption allegations, the jailing of key leaders and Kejriwal's own arrest damaged AAP's campaign, creating a vacuum the BJP swiftly filled. Backed by vast resources and a powerful electoral machine, the BJP's \"double-engine\" pitch - where state and federal governments are ruled by the same party - promised stability and better governance.",
      "This is a historic victory - BJP's first Delhi majority in almost 30 years. Its \"Parivartan\" (change) message struck a chord, but its political and financial muscle sealed the landslide win.",
      "Fresh off wins in the states of Haryana and Maharashtra, this cements BJP's resurgence after last year's general election setback. With Delhi slipping away, the fragmented opposition is in disarray, while the BJP enters the next electoral cycle with a clear upper hand.",
      "On Saturday, the biggest upsets for AAP included top leaders Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia losing in the New Delhi and Jangpura constituencies, respectively.",
      "Incumbent Chief Minister Atishi managed only a narrow victory from the Kalkaji constituency.",
      "More than 60% of eligible voters cast their ballots. Most exit polls had predicted an absolute majority for the BJP, although such predictions have gone wrong in the past.",
      "Much of the BJP campaign targeted Kejriwal, an anti-graft activist, who - along with Sisodia - had been jailed over the past two years in a corruption case relating to a now-scrapped alcohol sales policy. Both leaders, who deny all the charges, separately got bail last year after spending months in jail.",
      "Kejriwal has accused Modi's party of carrying out a \"political vendetta\" against him and the AAP, which the BJP denies.",
      "Delhi has a unique governance structure. Key decisions related to public order, police and land are taken by the lieutenant governor (LG) who is appointed by the federal government. The state legislature handles matters including education, health and public services.",
      "This division has often caused friction between the federal government and state legislature when they are run by rival parties.",
      "The power structure was also a reason why the election campaigning in Delhi was more focused on welfare than on political or identity issues, which play a larger role in elections elsewhere in the country.",
      "The AAP and BJP campaigns both promised improvements to public schools and free healthcare services, as well as cash handouts to women.",
      "Meanwhile, the BJP hoped for a boost from last week's federal budget, which slashed income tax for the salaried middle class, a key voting bloc in the capital.",
      "One topic, however, remained largely off the agenda during the bitter weeks-long campaign - Delhi's perennial air pollution crisis, which affects the city of more than 30 million for much of the year.",
      "The BJP had promised to reduce the city's Air Quality Index (AQI) by half by 2030 if it won, and other parties also made references to the crisis in their manifestos. But the issue didn't dominate discussions or become a talking point in the election campaign.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration has announced huge cuts to the agency's workforce and the immediate suspension of almost all of its aid programmes.",
      "The US government has announced a 90-day freeze on funding for aid projects while it undertakes a \"review\" to ensure they align with President Trump's priorities.",
      "Trump is a long-term critic of overseas spending and has said it needs to be brought into line with his \"America First\" strategy.",
      "The administration has targeted USAID in particular, saying the agency's spending is totally unexplainable and has singled out certain projects as examples of how the agency is, in its view, wasting taxpayers' money.",
      "Health experts, on the other hand, have warned of the spread of disease, as well as delays to the development of vaccines and new treatments as a result of the cuts.",
      "As well as directly running many health programmes, USAID funds other organisations to carry out work on its behalf, and the freeze in funding has caused confusion among these groups too.",
      "Waivers for the funding freeze have been issued for some humanitarian programmes, but the announcement has already caused widespread disruption to services.",
      "Dr Tom Wingfield, an expert in tuberculosis (TB) and social medicine at the UK's Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, told the BBC it is hard to underplay the impact of the decision to dismantle USAID.",
      "\"People don't appreciate the extent and reach of USAID. It goes towards under-nutrition, hygiene, toilets, access to clean water, which all have a massive impact on TB and diarrhoeal diseases.",
      "\"Diseases don't respect borders - that's even more the case where we have climate change and mass movement of people. Infectious diseases will spread.\"",
      "Dr Wingfield says TB kills 1.3 million people per year and makes a further 10 million people ill.",
      "But four out of 10 people never receive any care and can therefore transmit the disease, he said.",
      "\"Whether it's a research project or a clinic affected, then we run risk of further transmission.",
      "\"People will die directly because of cuts in US funding.\"",
      "It's not just TB clinics that are at risk, but those providing care for people living with HIV.",
      "Much of this work is done by non-governmental organisations, NGOs, who provide vital anti-retroviral medicines which can suppress the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, which helps prevent sexual transmission to other people.",
      "Dr Wingfield says if treatment is disrupted, there could be serious problems.",

      "Prof Peter Taylor, director of international development studies at Sussex University, said one of the biggest issues with the freeze was an erosion of trust.",
      "\"Stopping things suddenly undermines people's trust. People are bewildered and angry,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Vittorio Sella was a pioneering Italian photographer whose work at the turn of the 20th Century shaped both mountain photography and mountaineering history.",
      "His rare images of the Himalayas remain some of the most iconic ever captured.",
      "A new ongoing show in the Indian capital, Delhi, called Vittorio Sella: Photographer in the Himalaya brings to life the breathtaking grandeur of the Himalayas through his lens.",
      "Curated by renowned British explorer and author Hugh Thomson and organised by Delhi Art Gallery (DAG), the show is likely one of the largest collection of Sella's Indian views.",
      "It features some of the earliest high-altitude photographs of Kanchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain, and K2, the world's second-tallest mountain, captured over a century ago.",
      "Born in Biella, a town known for its wool trade in northern Italy, Sella (1859\u20131943)  made his first ascents in the nearby Alps.",
      "\"Throughout his career Sella made use of his skills in engineering and chemistry that the wool mills and his father had taught him,\" says Thomson.",
      "By his twenties, he had mastered complex photographic techniques like the collodion process, enabling him to develop large-format glass plates under harsh conditions.",
      "His panoramic images, crafted with technical perfection, earned worldwide acclaim.",
      "Sella's Himalayan journey began in 1899 when he joined British explorer Douglas Freshfield on an expedition circumnavigating Kanchenjunga.",
      "Any circumnavigation of the mountain also involved an incursion into Nepal, which was also a closed kingdom.",
      "While the team's climbing ambitions were thwarted by relentless rain, Sella seized the opportunity to capture pristine snow-dusted peaks. He experimented restlessly with technology, trying out telephoto pictures of Kanchenjunga. His images  transported viewers to a world untouched by time.",
      "A decade later, Sella reached new heights - both literally and artistically - on a 1909 expedition to K2 with the Duke of the Abruzzi.",
      "His photographs of the world's most difficult mountain stand as a testament to his skill and resilience. Carrying a camera system weighing nearly 30kg, Sella crisscrossed treacherous landscapes, creating images that defined mountain photography.",
      "Jim Curran, author of K2: The Story of the Savage Mountain, calls Sella \"possibly the greatest mountain photographer... his name [is] synonymous with technical perfection and aesthetic refinement\".",
      "Sella was known for his extraordinary toughness, traversing the Alps at remarkable speed despite carrying heavy photographic gear.",
      "His makeshift camera harness and boots - three times heavier than modern ones - are preserved at the Photographic Institute in Biella.",
      "His clothing alone weighed over 10kg, while his camera equipment, including a Dallmeyer camera, tripod, and plates, added another 30kg - more than today's airline baggage limits.",
      "On the K2 expedition, Sella captured around 250 formal photographs with his Ross & Co camera over four to five months; on Kanchenjunga, about 200, notes Thomson.",
      "\"By modern digital standards, this number is nothing extraordinary -  and even in the last days of analogue film, it would equate to some eight rolls, what a 1970s photographer could have used in a single morning on a single mountain - but when Sella was photographing, this was a considerable number.",
      "\"This meant enormous care and thought was given to each photograph, both because he had relatively few plates he could shoot.\"",
      "Years later, the famous mountaineer-photographer Ansel Adams would write that the \"purity of Sella's interpretations move the spectator to a religious awe\".",
      "High-altitude photography came with risks - many of Sella's most ambitious shots were ruined when humid conditions caused tissue dividers to stick to the negatives.",
      "Yet those that survived reveal a masterful eye, notes Thomson.",
      "\"Sella was one of the first to recognise how tracks in the snow are as much part of the composition as the mountaineers who made them.\"",

    "title": "Tourists leave after earthquakes rock Santorini, but resilient locals remain",
    "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2025 20:10:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Many started evacuating the island as it was hit by tremors - but some have decided to stay.",
    "story": [
      "On a calm summer day on Santorini in July 1956, disaster hit.",
      "\"I remember our dog and bird acting strangely. Then, the earthquake struck,\" 83-year-old Eirini Mindrinou recalls. \"The house split open before closing again. Through the crack in the roof, I could see the sky.\"",
      "The 7.8-magnitude earthquake, which hit between Santorini and the nearby island of Amorgos, destroyed much of the island, and a powerful aftershock 12 minutes later caused further damage. Fifty-three people died.",
      "The island, then just a quiet fishing village, was scarred and its people fled.",
      "It is much different today, rebuilt into one of Greece's most coveted tourists destinations \u2013 but this week, another mass exodus unfolded as a new wave of earthquakes hit the island.",
      "Subtle tremors that had begun in June 2024 turned into full-fledged quakes, shaking homes and unsettling the island's residents. Families rushed to leave by air and sea, desperately seeking respite as the ground shook once again.",
      "But not everyone is fleeing. Those that remain display the mix of courage, necessity, and a deep connection to the land that has come to define the locals of this island. They endure sleepless nights, haunted by memories of the past and the terrifying unknown of what's yet to come.",
      "\"The noise from the earthquake... it's unbearable. Even in my house, it's become overwhelming,\" says Margarita Karamolegkou, a local businesswoman. \"I've felt tired, day after day, with no end in sight\u2026 But I haven't felt fear. I can't leave my home, and I can't leave the people who've stayed behind.\"",
      "This resilience is nothing new. People have have withstood both social change -about 3.4 million visited the island last year, according to Mayor Nikos Zorzos - and seismic shifts. Now, as always, they have come together in solidarity.",
      "\"We're doing our best to support the vulnerable,\" says Matthaios Fytros, a local volunteer and merchant. \"People with disabilities, the elderly - many struggle to get around, and their homes are hard to reach. If a major earthquake hits, I know exactly where they live, and I'll get to them as fast as I can, alongside the firefighters.\"",
      "Matthaios and others patrol the island, ensuring abandoned properties aren't looted and helping anyone in need. \"I'm not afraid,\" he says with quiet conviction. \"We're proud of our island. I just hope everything works out and that this ordeal ends soon. We'll be happy to have our visitors back with us.\"",
      "The response of the state has been swift, with measures taken to address the crisis. Beneath the gratitude for the government's intervention, however, lingers a quiet bitterness. Many islanders recall the years when their cries for better infrastructure and support went unheard.",
      "\"For years, we've been asking for a better port, something to help us manage the growing number of tourists,\" Margarita says, her voice tinged with frustration. \"We need help preserving the island's identity - its unique environment, the seismic and volcanic forces that shape it. We're grateful for the tourists, but we also need to protect what makes Santorini special.\"",
      "Tourism has become the lifeblood of Santorini's economy. The island contributes around 2.5% to Greece's GDP, approximately 5.9 billion euros (\u00a34.9 billion) each year.",
      "As the tremors continue, the future of Santorini's economy remains uncertain. Will its prosperity withstand the shaking ground? The people of Santorini worry that the island's fragility may soon extend beyond the land itself.",
      "\"I regret how haphazard the island's development has been with the rise in tourism,\" says Eirini, who is temporarily in Athens, not out of fear, but for routine medical tests. \"We've damaged the natural environment here. Now, with the earthquakes continuing, there's a real risk we could lose the entire tourist season.\"",
      "Scientists may not know when the shaking will stop, but instead of succumbing to fear, some residents have chosen to understand the phenomenon, hoping that will bring them reassurance in the face of the unknown.",
      "\"I try to think of what's happening with kindness,\" Margarita says thoughtfully. \"It feels like something is settling down there. Everything we admire about Santorini today - the beauty, the character - has been shaped by the volcano and its seismic forces.\"",
      "\"We are the most beloved island,\" says Matthaios, his voice full of pride. \"And I believe we're the most beautiful of all the islands in Greece. We will get out of this stronger.\""

      "\"If the island sinks, I will sink with it,\" Delfino Davies says, his smile not fading for a second.",
      "There is silence, except for the swish of his broom across the floor of the small museum he runs documenting the life of his community in Panama, the Guna.",
      "\"Before, you could hear children shouting\u2026 music everywhere, neighbours arguing,\" he says, \"but now all the sounds have gone\".",
      "His community, living on the tiny low-lying island of Gardi Sugdub, is the first in Panama to be relocated because of climate change.",
      "The government has said they face \"imminent risk\" from rising sea levels, which scientists say are likely to render the island uninhabitable by 2050.",
      "In June last year, most of the residents abandoned this cramped jumble of wooden and tin homes for rows of neat prefabricated houses on the mainland.",
      "The relocation has been praised by some as a model for other groups worldwide whose homes are under threat, but even so, it has divided the community.",
      "\"My father, my brother, my sisters-in-law and my friends are gone,\" says Delfino. \"Sometimes the children whose families have stayed cry, wondering where their friends have gone, he says.",
      "House after house is padlocked. About 1,000 people left, while about 100 stayed - some because there was not enough room in the new settlement. Others, like Delfino, are not fully convinced climate change is a threat, or simply did not want to leave.",
      "He says he wants to stay close to the ocean, where he can fish. \"The people that lose their tradition lose their soul. The essence of our culture is on the islands,\" he adds.",
      "The Guna have lived on Gardi Sugdub since the 19th Century, and even longer on other islands in this archipelago off Panama's northern coast. They fled from the mainland to escape Spanish conquistadors and, later, epidemics and conflict with other indigenous groups.",
      "They are known for their clothes called \"molas\", decorated with colourful designs.",
      "The Guna currently inhabit more than 40 other islands. Steve Paton, a scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, says it is \"almost a certainty\" that most, if not all, of the islands will be submerged before the end of the century.",
      "As climate change causes the Earth to heat up, sea levels are rising as glaciers and ice sheets melt and seawater expands as it warms.",
      "Scientists warn that hundreds of millions of people living in coastal areas around the world could be at risk by the end of the century.",
      "On Gardi Sugdub, waves whipped up during the rainy season wash into homes, lapping below the hammocks where families sleep.",
      "Mr Paton says, \"it is very unlikely that the island will be habitable by 2050, based on current and projected rates of sea level rise\".",
      "However, the first discussions about relocation began, more than a decade ago, because of population growth, not climate change.",
      "The island is just 400m long and 150m wide. Some residents see overcrowding as the more pressing problem. But others, like Magdalena Mart\u00ednez, fear the rising sea:",
      "\"Every year, we saw the tides were higher,\" she says. \"We couldn't cook on our stoves and it was always flooded\u2026 so we said 'we have to get out of here'.\"",

      "\"I brought just my clothes and some kitchen utensils,\" she says. \"You feel like you are leaving pieces of your life on the island.\"",

      "In its new meeting house, which is roofed with branches and leaves in the traditional style, waits Tito L\u00f3pez, the community's sayla \u2013 or leader.",

      "The cramped school on the island has closed now, and students whose families stayed there travel each day to the new building with its computers, sports fields and library.",
      "Magdalena says conditions in Isberyala are better than on the island, where she says they had only four hours of electricity a day and had to fetch drinking water by boat from a river on the mainland.",
      "In Isberyala, the power supply is constant, but the water - pumped from wells nearby - is only switched on for a few hours a day. The system has at times broken down for days at a time.",
      "Also, there is no healthcare yet. Another resident, Yanisela Vallarino, says one evening her young daughter was unwell and she had to arrange transport back to the island late at night to see a doctor.",

    "title": "Sweden's worst mass shooting leaves immigrant community on edge",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 09:52:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Among the dead in Sweden's first school shooting were Syrians and Bosnians.",
    "story": [
      "In the middle of a grand, high-ceilinged church in Orebro, Sweden, Jacob Kasselia, a Syrian orthodox priest, looked up towards the stained glass windows above him, then back down at his hands. He adjusted the gold cross hanging from his neck.",
      "\"The police say this man acted alone,\" the priest said. \"But this hate, it is coming from somewhere.\"",
      "A member of Kasselia's congregation, 29-year-old Salim Iskef, was among those murdered in Orebro on Tuesday in Sweden's first school shooting and the worst mass shooting in the country's history. The gunman killed 10 students at an adult learning centre and then himself.",
      "Among the dead are Syrians and Bosnians, according to residents and the embassies of those countries, but the police in Orebro have not given any details of the victims publicly.",
      "Kasselia described Iskef as kind and thoughtful, keen to help other members of the community. He came to Sweden with his mother and sister, the priest said - refugees from Aleppo, where his father was killed in the war. Iskef was studying Swedish at the Risbergska school, the target of Tuesday's attack.",
      "\"He was simply a good man,\" the priest said. \"He did not look for trouble. He showed only goodwill. He was a member of our community.\"",
      "The night after the attack, Kasselia sat with Iskef's family to console them. Iskef was engaged and due to be married this summer. His fiancee Kareen Elia, 24, was \"very badly affected\", the priest said, and was \"going through a very difficult, very dark experience\".",
      "At a memorial service in Orebro on Thursday night, Elia broke down in screams and tears and had to be carried out of the church.",
      "In the days since the shooting, there has been a striking lack of information from the authorities. On Thursday night, police had still not confirmed the identity of the gunman - widely reported by Swedish media to be 35-year-old local Rickard Andersson - nor any details about his motive or the victims.",
      "In a statement issued early on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after the attack, police said the shooter did not appear to be motivated by any ideology. On Thursday, Anna Bergqvist, who is leading the police investigation, appeared to walk the statement back.",
      "\"Why they said that, I cannot comment,\" she told the BBC. \"We are looking at different motives and we will declare it when we have it.\"",
      "Swedish police are usually cautious about naming suspects during an investigation, but the absence of official information has contributed to a feeling of fear and uncertainty among Orebro's immigrant communities over the past few days.",
      "\"We are getting all our information from the media and I don't know why,\" said Nour Afram, 36, who was inside the Risbergska school when the attack began.",
      "\"We need more information,\" she said. \"We don't know why he did it, why did he target this school? Was he sick or was it something else?\"",
      "Afram was waiting to go into class when she heard people screaming that there was a shooter - something so unbelievable to her she thought at first it was a prank.",
      "\"We started to run and then I heard the gunshots,\" she said. \"One at first, then tak tak tak -  maybe ten shots. I was so scared I felt like my heart stopped in my chest.\"",
      "Afram, who immigrated from Syria to Orebro as a child, said she was afraid for the first time to send her three children to school in Sweden.",
      "Zaki Aydin, a 50-year-old Syriac language teacher in Orebro, said he was afraid for the first time for his young students, who are mostly from the Middle East. \"We are foreigners, we have to be careful now,\" he said.",
      "Aydin used to have the doors of his classroom and the church building open when he taught. \"Now we are closing them,\" he said. \"And yesterday I asked someone to stand outside to prevent anyone we didn't know already from coming in.\"",
      "One of the pupils at the school, 18-year-old Gabriel, said a \"nightmare had come true\" for Orebro.",
      "\"The problem is we have no motive, only speculation,\" he said. \"A lot of people my age are frightened to go to school, we feel like Sweden has become like America. The things you see on television have happened here.\"",
      "In the absence of any official news about the motive, all that the residents here in Orebro know is that the killer appears to have been a reclusive white Swedish man and that he targeted a school with a large immigrant student base.",
      "Tomas Poletti Lundstrom, an academic researcher in racism at Uppsala University, who happens to live just a few minutes from the site of the attack and heard police helicopters fly over his home on Tuesday, said Orebro was facing a \"deeply horrible time\".",
      "\"You can really sense it everywhere here, it is affecting everyone,\" Lundstrom said. \"We don't know the motives of the shooter yet, but we are living in a very racist time and this is a school for a lot of immigrants.\"",
      "Attacks like the one at Risbergska were \"the outcome of how our society looks at the moment, how our politicians talk, and how we talk about one another\", he said.",
      "\"The government and the main opposition support anti-immigrant policies and use anti-immigrant rhetoric,\" he added. \"This is what happens when politicians speak the way they are speaking.\"",
      "At the cordoned off entrance to Risbergska school early on Thursday morning, people were stopping by to leave flowers, light candles, or simply to stand and take in the scene. From the street, you can clearly see the front door through which the killer was filmed appearing to go from classroom to classroom with a rifle.",
      "Among those who came alone and stood for a while by the collection of candles and flowers was the city's mayor, John Johansson, who had made an official visit to the site the day before alongside the prime minister and the king and queen but stopped there again on his way to work on Thursday to pay his respects.",
      "\"I hope that the police will find conclusions soon,\" Johansson said. \"The city needs answers, our society needs answers, and the families of the victims need to know why this happened.\"",
      "But it was not time to \"speculate or rush ahead\", he said. \"We do not want to contribute to any false rumours, and so we hope the police will find answers as early as possible.\"",
      "Tony Estroem, a salesman from Eskilstuna, about 80km from Orebro, also stopped by the school on Thursday morning. \"This kind of shooting, at a school, you read about it elsewhere but not in Sweden,\" he said.",
      "\"It looks to be a Swedish guy, and perhaps that is better than if it had been an immigrant responsible,\" he added. \"Of course it is a terrible event either way, but we do not want to add more fuel to the fire.\"",
      "Police have given out some limited information about their investigation. They said that about 130 officers responded to the shooting in total, and that they were met by an \"inferno\" in the school. They said that they believe the gunman acted alone.",
      "Family members, former school friends and neighbours have told Swedish media he had become a recluse in recent years and may have suffered with psychological issues.",
      "There have been complaints about the handling of the case. The Bosnian ambassador Bojan Sosic, who also visited the site of the shooting, learned from residents that a Bosnian was among the dead.",
      "\"I find it odd, to say the least, that the police chooses to withhold information that pertains to foreign citizens from respective embassies,\" he said.",
      "Others, including members of the Syrian community, said they trusted the police were doing the right thing and only hoped to learn more soon. Kasselia, the Syrian Orthodox priest, said that the wider community \"does not know what the police are thinking, but we trust that they have their own plan\".",
      "Hundreds of people came to Kasselia's church on Thursday night from the Syrian, Turkish, Iraqi and other migrant communities. A picture of Salim Iskef, one of the shooting's victims, sat on an easel. Children from the congregation sung hymns. Iskef's family, sitting in a pew near the front, were consumed by grief.",
      "It is difficult to understand why these sorts of attacks happen even when the motive is known. Without it, it is even more confounding. A few hours before the memorial service began, Kasselia had been sitting in a pew in his empty church, trying to make sense of it.",
      "\"People die, of course. They become sick, they have some accident,\" he said. \"But this, how can we understand this? To be shot dead in a school. We could not dream of this. We cannot even describe it. Why?\"",
      "There was some comfort in hearing from the police that the gunman acted alone, Kasselia said. It left less anxiety of another attack.",
      "\"But this man had something in his heart, some kind of hate, that he gathered from somewhere,\" the priest said. \"We cannot say there are not others.\"",

    "story": [
      "The tall, shiny buildings which rise out of the cornfields on the Myanmar side of the Moei river are a sight so jarring you find yourself blinking to be sure you haven't imagined it.",
      "Eight years ago there was nothing over there in Karen State. Just trees, a few roughly built cement buildings, and a long-running civil war which has left this area of Myanmar one of the poorest places on earth. But today, on this spot along the border with Thailand, a small city has emerged like a mirage. It is called Shwe Kokko, or Golden Raintree.",
      "It is accused of being a city built on scams, home to a lucrative yet deadly nexus of fraud, money-laundering and human trafficking. The man behind it, She Zhijiang, is languishing in a Bangkok jail, awaiting extradition to China.",
      "But Yatai, She Zhijiang's company which built the city, paints a very different vision of Shwe Kokko in its promotional videos \u2013 as a resort city, a safe holiday destination for Chinese tourists and haven for the super-rich.",
      "The story of Shwe Kokko is also one of the unbridled ambition which has rippled out of China in the last two decades.",
      "She Zhijiang dreamed of building this glittering city as his ticket out of the shadowy world of scams and gambling which he inhabited.",
      "But by aiming so high he has drawn the attention of Beijing, which is now keen to stamp out the fraud operations along the Thai-Myanmar border which are increasingly targeting Chinese people.",
      "Publicity about the scams is also hurting Thai tourism \u2013 Thailand is shutting down power to compounds over the border, toughening its banking rules and promising to block visas for those suspected of using Thailand as a transit route.",
      "Shwe Kokko has been left marooned in post-coup, war-wracked Myanmar, unable to bring in the flow of investment and visitors it needs to keep going.",
      "Yatai is trying to fix the city's sinister image by allowing journalists to see it, holding out hope that more favourable reporting might even get She Zhijiang out of jail.",
      "So they invited the BBC to Shwe Kokko.",
      "Inside Shwe Kokko",
      "Getting there is tricky.",
      "Ever since construction began in 2017, Shwe Kokko has been a forbidden place, off-limits to casual visitors.",
      "As the civil war in Myanmar escalated after the 2021 military coup, access became even more difficult. It takes three days from the country's commercial hub Yangon \u2013 through multiple checkpoints, blocked roads and a real risk of getting caught in armed skirmishes. Crossing from Thailand takes just a few minutes, but requires careful planning to avoid Thai police and army patrols.",
      "She Zhijiang's colleagues took us on a tour, highlighting the newly paved streets, the luxury villas, the trees \u2013 \"Mr She believes in making a green city,\" they told us. Our guide was Wang Fugui, who said he was a former police officer from Guangxi in southern China. He ended up in prison in Thailand, on what he insists were trumped-up fraud charges. There he got to know She Zhijiang and became one of his most trusted lieutenants.",
      "At first glance, Shwe Kokko has the appearance of a provincial Chinese city. The signs on the buildings are written in Chinese characters, and there is a constant procession of Chinese-made construction vehicles going to and from building sites.",
      "Yatai is vague about the tenants of all its buildings, as it is about many things. \"Rich people, from many countries, they rent the villas,\" they told us. And what about the businesses? \"Many businesses. Hotels, casinos.\"",
      "However, most of the people we saw were local Karen, one of Myanmar's ethnic minorities, who come into Shwe Kokko every day to work. We saw very few of the overseas visitors who are supposed to be the customers of the hotels and casinos.",
      "Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour was not allowed, and that \"online businesses\" should leave. But we were quietly told by local people that the scam business was still running.",
      "Starting a decade ago in the unchecked frenzy of Chinese investment on the Cambodian coast, then moving to the lawless badlands of Myanmar's border with China, the scam operators have now settled along the Thai-Myanmar border. Around them, the Myanmar military and a hotch-potch of rebel armies and warlords are fighting for control of Karen State.",
      "The scams have grown into a multi-billion dollar business. They involve thousands of workers from China, South East Asia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent kept in walled-off compounds where they defraud people all over the world of their savings.",
      "Some work there willingly, but others are abducted and forced to work. Those who have escaped have told harrowing stories of torture and beatings. Some have come from Shwe Kokko.",
      "We were able to speak to a young woman who had been working in one of the scam centres a couple of weeks before our visit. She had not enjoyed it and been allowed to leave.",
      "Her job, she said, was as part of the modelling team, made up mostly of attractive young women, who contact potential victims and try to build an intimate online relationship with them.",
      "\"The target is the elderly,\" she said. \"You start a conversation like 'oh you look just like one of my friends'. Once you make friends you encourage them by sending pictures of yourself, sometimes wearing your night clothes.\"",
      "Then, she explains, the conversation moves to get-rich-quick schemes, such as crypto investments, with the women claiming that's how they made a lot of money.",
      "\"When they feel close to you, you pass them on to the chatting section,\" she says. \"The chatting people will continue messaging with the client, persuading them to buy shares in the crypto company.\"",
      "During our brief time in Shwe Kokko we were only allowed to see what Yatai wanted us to see. Even so, it was evident that the scams have not stopped, and are probably still the main business in the city.",
      "Our request to see inside any of the newly built office buildings was turned down. Those are private, they kept telling us. We were escorted at all times by security guards seconded from the militia group which controls this part of the border.",
      "We were allowed to film the construction work, and the outsides of the buildings, but not to enter them. Many of the windows had bars on the insides.",
      "\"Everybody in Shwe Kokko knows what goes on there,\" said the young woman who used to work in a scam centre.",
      "She dismissed Yatai's claim that it no longer permitted scam centres in Shwe Kokko.",
      "\"That is a lie. There is no way they don't know about this. The whole city is doing it in those high-rise buildings. No-one goes there for fun. There is no way Yatai doesn't know.\"",
      "Who is She Zhijiang?",
      "\"I can promise that Yatai would never accept telecom fraud and scams,\" said She Zhijiang on a call from Bangkok's Remand Prison, where he is being held.",
      "Yatai wanted us to hear from the man himself, and hooked up a ropey video link. Only Mr Wang could be seen talking to him; we had to stay out of view of the prison guards, and had to rely on Mr Wang to put our questions to him.",
      "Not much is known about She Zhijiang, a small-town Chinese entrepreneur who Beijing alleges is a criminal mastermind.",
      "Born in a poor village in Hunan province in China in 1982, he left school at 14 and learned computer coding. He appears to have moved to the Philippines in his early 20s and into online gambling, which is illegal in China.",
      "This is where he started to make his money. In 2014 he was convicted by a Chinese court of running an illegal lottery, but he stayed overseas.",
      "He invested in gambling businesses in Cambodia, and managed to get Cambodian citizenship. He has used at least four different names.",
      "In 2016, he struck a deal with a Karen warlord, Saw Chit Thu, to build a new city together. She Zhijiang would provide the funds, the Chinese construction machinery and materials, while Saw Chit Thu and his 8,000 armed fighters would keep it safe.",
      "Glitzy videos by Yatai promised a $15bn (\u00a312.1bn) investment and depicted a high-rise wonderland of hotels, casinos and cyberparks. Shwe Kokko was described as part of Xi Jinping's Belt-and-Road Initiative or BRI, bringing Chinese funds and infrastructure to the world.",
      "China publicly dissociated itself from She Zhijiang in 2020, and the Myanmar government launched an investigation into Yatai, which was building far beyond the 59 villas authorised by its investment permit and was operating casinos before these had been legalised in Myanmar.",
      "In August 2022, acting on a Chinese request to Interpol, She Zhijiang was arrested and imprisoned in Bangkok. He and his business partner Saw Chit Thu have also been sanctioned by the British government for their links to human trafficking.",
      "She Zhijiang claims to be a victim of double dealing by the Chinese state. He says he founded his company Yatai on the instruction of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and insists that Shwe Kokko was then a part of the BRI.",
      "He accuses China's communist leadership of turning on him because he refused to give them control of his project. They wanted a colony on the Thai-Myanmar border, he says. China has denied any business relationship with She Zhijiang.",
      "While he denied any wrongdoing on Yatai's part, She Zhijiang, however, admitted to \"a high probability\" that scammers were coming to Shwe Kokko to spend their money.",
      "\"Because our Yatai City is completely open to anyone who can go in and out freely. Refusing customers, for a businessman like me, is really difficult. This is my weakness.\"",
      "It is, however, stretching credulity to believe that Yatai, which runs everything in Shwe Kokko, was unable to stop scammers coming in and out of the city.",
      "It is also hard to think of any business other than scams which would choose to operate here.",
      "With Thailand cutting off power and telecommunications, electricity comes from diesel generators, which are expensive to run. And communications go through Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system, which is also very costly.",
      "Yatai's strategy is \"to whitewash the project to create a narrative that Shwe Kokko is a safe city\", says Jason Tower, from the United States Institute for Peace, which has spent years researching the scam operation in Shwe Kokko.",
      "He says they may even \"begin moving some of the more notorious components of the scam industry, like torture, into other zones\".",
      "But he doesn't think the plan will work: \"What kinds of legitimate businesses will go into Shwe Kokko? It's simply not attractive. The economy will continue to be a scam economy.\"",
      "A business in a war zone",
      "When we were eventually allowed to see inside one casino in Shwe Kokko, run by a genial Australian, he told us they were going to close it down.",
      "Inside the only customers were local Karen, gambling on a popular arcade-like game where they had to shoot digital fish. We were forbidden from doing any interviews. The back rooms, with the card and roulette tables, were empty.",
      "The Australian manager said the casino - built six years ago - had been popular and profitable when there were just one or two of them, before the civil war. But these days, with at least nine in operation, there were not enough customers to go around.",
      "The real money was in online gambling, which he said was the main business in Shwe Kokko.",
      "It is impossible to know how much money is made through online gambling, and how much through outright criminal activities like money laundering and scams. They are usually run from the same compounds and by the same teams. When we asked Yatai how much money they made they would not tell us \u2013 not even a ballpark figure. That is private, they said.",
      "The company is registered in Hong Kong, Myanmar and Thailand, but these are little more than shell companies, with very little income or revenue passing through them.",
      "We turned down Yatai's offer to see the go-kart track, water park and model farm that they have built. We did glimpse one other casino, while being taken to eat breakfast in Yatai's own luxury hotel, though we could not go inside it. It seemed empty.",
      "The only other facility we were allowed to see was a karaoke club, with spectacular private rooms, cavernous domes entirely covered in digital screens on which huge tropical fish and sharks swam.",
      "They also ran video loops extolling the vision and virtues of She Zhijiang. This club too seemed deserted, except for some young Chinese women who worked there.",
      "They wore opera masks to avoid being identified, and danced unenthusiastically to music for a few minutes before giving up and sitting down.",
      "Interviews were not permitted. We were allowed to talk to a local Karen member of staff, but she was so intimidated by this we got little more than her name.",
      "In his absence, She Zhijiang has left the running of Shwe Kokko to a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 31-year-old He Yingxiong. He lives with Wang Fugui in a sprawling villa they have built on the banks of the Moei River, overlooking Thailand, and guarded by massive Chinese bodyguards. There they play mahjong, eat the finest food and drink, and keep an eye on business.",
      "Mr He has a slightly different explanation from his boss for the scams still operating under their noses. \"We are just property developers,\" he said. \"I can guarantee that this kind of thing does not happen here.",
      "\"But even if it does, the local people have their own legal system, so it is their job to deal with it. Our job is just to provide good infrastructure, good buildings and supporting industries.\"",
      "But there is no legal system in this part of Myanmar, nor any government. It is ruled by the various armed groups which control different bits of territory along the Thai border.",
      "Their commanders decide who can build or run a business, taking their cut to help fund their wars against the Myanmar military, or against each other. Many of them are known to be hosting scam compounds.",
      "Mr He admitted that it was the war which had allowed Yatai to obtain the land so cheaply. Karen human rights groups have accused Saw Chit Thu of driving the original inhabitants off their land, with minimal compensation, though it is clear Yatai is also providing badly needed jobs for the locals.",
      "It is the lawlessness of Karen State which makes it so appealing to illegal businesses \u2013 and that doesn't help the image of Shwe Kokko.",
      "Neither do recent headlines.",
      "Last month a 22-year-old Chinese actor, Wang Xing, was rescued from a scam centre on the border after being lured to Thailand with an offer of work on a movie shoot. His disappearance spurred a barrage of questions on Chinese social media, forcing the Thai and Chinese authorities to mount a joint operation to free him.",
      "Chinese tourists have been cancelling their holidays in Thailand, fearing for their safety. Other rescues have followed.",
      "The BBC has been sent emails by some scam victims pleading for help; rescue organisations believe there are still thousands trapped. Nearly all are in smaller compounds along the border south of Shwe Kokko.",
      "Yatai stressed to us that they are not the same as these rougher operations, some little more than a collection of sheds built in forest clearings. That is where all the bad things happen now, they said.",
      "They talked about KK Park, a notorious compound south of the border town of Myawaddy, and Dongmei, a cluster of low-rise buildings run by a prominent Chinese crime lord called Wan Kuok Koi, better known as Broken Tooth.",
      "That distinction hasn't helped She Zhijiang, who once had the ear of politicians, police bosses and even minor royalty in Thailand. Today he appears to have lost even the influence he once had in prison, to buy himself special privileges. He has complained of being roughed up by the guards.",
      "His lawyers are appealing against the Interpol red notice used to justify his arrest, but China's voice will probably be loudest in determining his fate.",
      "From our interview with him, Shi Zhijiang seemed genuinely outraged over his sudden reversal of fortune.",
      "\"Before, I had no understanding of human rights, but now I really understand how horrible it is to have human rights infringed upon,\" he said.",
      "\"It is hard to imagine how the human rights of ordinary people in China are trampled upon when a respected businessman like me, who used to be able to go to the same state banquets as Xi Jinping, does not have his human rights and dignity protected in any way.\"",
      "It seems he really did believe he could build something which would one day transcend Shwe Kokko's sordid origins as a scam city.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 20:16:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists say it is unclear how many more earthquakes will come to the idyllic Greek island.",
    "story": [
      "\"We've put all our mattresses in the living room,\" says Georgia Nomikou.",
      "The Santorini resident fears the impact of ongoing earthquakes on the Greek island, popular with tourists for its picture-postcard views.",
      "But the idyll has been disrupted this past week by thousands of earthquakes.",
      "Santorini, and other Greek islands in the region, are in the middle of an \"unprecedented\" seismic swarm or crisis - the name for an abrupt increase in earthquakes in a particular area.",
      "About three-quarters of the island's 15,000 population have evacuated while authorities declared a state of emergency after a 5.2 magnitude quake, the largest yet, rocked the island on Wednesday.",
      "Further, albeit smaller quakes, were felt again on Thursday.",
      "The \"clusters\" of quakes have puzzled scientists who say such a pattern is unusual because they have not been linked to a major shock. So what's going on?",
      "What is happening in Santorini?",
      "Experts agree the island is experiencing what Greece's prime minister has called an \"extremely and intricate geological phenomenon\".",
      "\"It is really unprecedented, we have never seen something like this before in [modern times] in Greece,\" says Dr Athanassios Ganas, research director of the National Observatory of Athens.",
      "Santorini lies on the Hellenic Volcanic Arc - a chain of islands created by volcanoes.",
      "But it has not seen a major eruption in recent times, in fact not since the 1950s, so the reason for the current crisis is unclear.",
      "Experts say they're seeing many earthquakes within a relatively small area, which don't fit the pattern of a mainshock-aftershock sequence, says Dr Ganas.",
      "He said this began with the awakening of a volcano on Santorini last summer. Then in January there was a \"surge\" of seismic activity with smaller earthquakes being recorded.",
      "That activity has escalated in the past week.",
      "Thousands of earthquakes have been recorded since Sunday, with Wednesday's the most significant yet.",
      "\"We are in the middle of a seismic crisis,\" Dr Gasnas said.",
      "Dr Margarita Segou from the British Geological Survey described the quakes as happening every day \"in pulses\".",
      "She says this \"swarm-like behaviour\" means that when a more significant  earthquake strikes, for example a magnitude four, the \"seismicity is increased for one to two hours, and then the system relaxes again\".",
      "How much longer will this seismic activity last?",
      "In short, it is impossible to tell. There are hopes that Wednesday's quake, which struck at night, will be the biggest one to hit the island.",
      "But seismologists have told the BBC it is difficult to be sure. Authorities have warned the activity could go on for weeks.",
      "Experts also do not know whether this chain of quakes are foreshocks leading up to a large earthquake or their own event.",
      "Professor Joanna Faure Walker, an earthquake geology expert at UCL's Institute of Disaster Risk Reduction, said some large earthquakes do experience foreshocks - elevated levels of small to moderate seismic events - before the main shock.",
      "But what is happening now are not volcanic earthquakes, say Dr Ganas. Volcanic earthquakes have a characteristic signature of low frequency wave forms and these have not been exhibited here.",
      "Dr Segou told the BBC she and colleagues had analysed previous earthquakes in the region with machine learning - a data analysis method able to make predictions - to learn how earthquakes in the region in 2002 and 2004 came to an end.",
      "The magnitude of those earthquakes were not as intense as the ones felt now she said. But the \"signatures\" of how they started and ended could help build a picture of what patterns to look out for.",
      "Meanwhile, additional police units and military forces have been deployed to the island to help it cope with any major earthquake.",
      "Ms Nomikou, who is president of Santorini's town council, said her family were staying put but had each packed a small bag, \"ready to go if anything happens\".",
      "But some islanders say they are not fazed by the tremors.",
      "\"I'm not afraid at all,\" says one Santorini resident, who decided to stay put on the volcanic island despite thousands of her neighbours fleeing amid the ongoing earthquakes.",
      "Chantal Metakides insists that she would not be joining her compatriots. \"For 500 years, this house has lived through earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and it's still standing,\" she told AFP news agency, adding, \"there's no reason why this should change\".",

    "story": [
      "Finding and fighting the militants who have become the beating heart of the Islamic State (IS) group in Africa can be tough work as they hide deep in the mountains of north-eastern Somalia.",
      "But in typical Donald Trump style, after the new US president ordered an airstrike on the area last weekend, he posted on social media: \"WE WILL FIND YOU, AND WE WILL KILL YOU!\"",
      "Trump said the hit, less than two weeks into his term, had targeted a senior IS attack planner and other militants in Somalia's semi-autonomous region of Puntland and had \"destroyed the caves they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians\".",
      "He boasted that he had succeeded where former US President Joe Biden had failed.",
      "\"Biden and his cronies wouldn't act quickly enough to get the job done. I did!\"",
      "The fact that Somalia was the target of America's first major military operation under the new administration surprised many in the country who feared the US was planning to abandon them.",
      "In his first term, Trump withdrew about 700 American troops, a decision reversed by his successor.",
      "The $600,000 (\u00a3492,000) a year deal the Somalia government recently signed with top Washington lobbying firm, the BGR Group, is an indication of how worried it is.",
      "Under Biden, US troops in Somalia were carrying out special operations, training an elite Somali force and conducting regular airstrikes.",
      "A day before the airstrike, the Washington Post published an interview with Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud in which he pleaded for the US \"not to pull out the American advisers and consultants who are supporting the training of our special forces\".",
      "A post on X from his office after the strike also had a touch of desperation about it, acknowledging \"the unwavering support of the United States in the fight against international terrorism\" and welcoming \"the continued commitment under the decisive leadership of President Donald Trump\".",
      "But airstrikes are different from troops on the ground and Trump did not stop aerial bombardments in his first term. In fact, he increased them to nearly 400.",
      "\"The strike does not mean that the US government is going to step up its military engagement in Somalia,\" says Matt Bryden, the strategic adviser of Nairobi-based Sahan Research.",
      "\"Several American officials expected to assume leadership positions on African affairs no longer perceive Somalia's federal government to be a credible partner and are deeply critical of the high levels of security assistance provided in recent years to very little appreciable effect.\"",
      "Puntland's counter-terrorism approach is different from that of the national Somali government, with which it cut ties in March last year.",
      "It is more self-reliant and not as heavily dependent on support from African Union troops - of which around 12,000 are on the ground - and global powers including the US and Turkey.",
      "As Mohamed Mubarak, head of Puntland's security co-ordination office, points out it is troops from the north-east that have been battling IS for years with little help or thanks from others.",
      "\"It is not fair to put the airstrike front and centre while we have been fighting and dying on the ground,\" Mr Mubarak says.",
      "\"Regardless of what the rest of the world is doing, we are fighting IS, which is an international problem,\" he says.",
      "\"We have not seen much support except from Kenya, Ethiopia and the UAE. We don't know if the Americans will conduct more than one airstrike.\"",
      "Puntland says its forces have captured 48 caves and IS outposts - and destroyed dozens of drones and explosive devices - since launching its full-scale \"hilaac\" or \"lightning\" offensive last year.",
      "Although IS has been active in Somalia for about a decade, it has posed less of a threat than the Islamist group al-Shabab, which controls large parts of the country and has been described as al-Qaeda's most successful affiliate.",
      "However, in recent times, IS has become more significant - locally, regionally and internationally.",
      "The authorities in Puntland and unnamed US officials say IS-Somalia's leader, the orange-bearded, bespectacled Abdulqadir Mumin, is now the global head of IS.",
      "Initial reports suggested he had been killed in a US airstrike last May but have never been confirmed.",
      "Whether or not Mumin is the head of IS or is alive or dead, IS-Somalia has become increasingly worrying for foreign states.",
      "As Trump said: \"These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United States and our allies.\"",
      "According to Tricia Bacon, director of the policy anti-terrorism hub at American University in Washington DC, \"IS-Somalia has taken on more responsibilities within the Islamic State network, particularly in Africa but beyond the continent as well\".",
      "With branches of IS operating across the continent, from Mozambique to Mali, from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Nigeria, IS-Somalia serves as a crucial nerve centre.",
      "Ms Bacon warns that IS-Somalia is looking beyond Africa too.",
      "\"It is positioned to facilitate and contribute to IS attacks in the West, including the United States. It also seeks to inspire attacks in the West,\" she says.",
      "\"International partners should provide more support to Puntland's ongoing efforts against the group.\"",
      "Mr Bryden says collusion with Iranian-backed Houthi rebels across the Red Sea in Yemen is also an issue.",
      "\"Like al-Shabab, IS-Somalia has received arms and training from the Houthis in Yemen, which is a source of concern for the US government and its allies,\" he says.",
      "A growing number of foreign fighters are joining the group, enhancing its strength in terms of numbers and expertise.",
      "A major source of IS-Somalia recruits are thought to be Ethiopian migrants, who gather in Puntland's port city of Bosaso in the hope of a sea crossing to a better life abroad.",
      "IS offers them better pay than they would earn in the Gulf states and experts say that some of the group's senior commanders are Ethiopian.",
      "\"We assess that IS-Somalia is 80% or more foreign fighters, mostly from North Africa, Ethiopia, Tanzania and the Middle East, in that order,\" says Mr Mubarak.",
      "He estimates the group is about 1,000-strong; UN monitors put it at around 600 to 700.",
      "Last October, the head of the US Africa Command, Michael Langley, said he thought IS had grown in northern Somalia by about \"two-fold\" in a year.",
      "The group staged one of its most sophisticated ever attacks in December, hitting a military base in Puntland's Bari region.",
      "The group released a statement saying not a single Somali was involved. The 12 attackers came from seven countries - Tanzania, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Yemen and Ethiopia.",
      "The movement has also become more effective at raising money.",
      "The US, UN and Somalia experts say a key part of IS's financial infrastructure - the al-Karrar office - is based in Puntland, disbursing funds and expertise to other branches of the group in Africa and beyond.",
      "The US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said IS-Somalia had raised nearly $2m in the first half of 2022 by taxing local businesses, imports, nomads and farmers.",
      "If Puntland's forces are to succeed in driving out the militants, air support will prove invaluable.",
      "Shortly after the US strike, Puntland police said the head of IS-Somalia's assassination squad, Abdirahman Shirwa Aw-Said, had surrendered.",
      "But experts say such strikes will need to be consistent to hunt down existing IS cells in Somalia and stop others mushrooming.",
      "It is unclear whether the US and its unpredictable leader have the appetite to keep bombing Somalia's north-eastern mountains.",

      "They wonder aloud whether Basel will ever be able to freely visit Yuval's home in Israel, whether Basel's village will get building permits, and whether they will one day have stability.",
      "For years, the friends have been filming the destruction of houses, a well and a school by the Israeli army after a court order declared Basel's community illegal. They tell each other they hope they will change that reality.",
      "Now, that scene has reached some of the world's biggest stages.",
      "The film it is in, No Other Land, has been nominated for an Oscar and a Bafta for best documentary feature.",
      "It follows the fight over Masafer Yatta, a community of around 20 villages, and the friendship between Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham.",
      "In the film Basel is nearly detained after a protest, his father is arrested, and a soldier shoots a community member in the neck while confiscating a generator, leading to the man's paralysis and death.",
      "\"It's scary because yes, the film is succeeding and people are aware of it, but I don't think there is sufficient action, especially amongst those who have power to change this,\" Yuval told the BBC.",
      "\"I don't have an illusion that films are going to change the world, but I know they can change individuals, and I know that they can be part of a bigger change, and we really need this now.\"",
      "Basel and Yuval created the film along with Hamdan Ballal and Rachel Szor over five years.",
      "Asked about the man who was paralysed, the IDF said its investigation had found no crime. A spokesperson said that during an operation against \"illegal construction\", two Palestinians had grabbed a soldier by his weapon and vest, leading to the shot.",
      "Palestinian eyewitnesses told Israeli media they were not contacted as part of the initial investigation and believed the shot was fired intentionally.",
      "Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Israeli settlements in the territory are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. They have expanded over the past 55 years, becoming a focal point of violence and conflicting claims over land.",
      "On 7 October 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. That triggered an Israeli military campaign that has killed at least 47,500 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Since then, settler-related violence in the West Bank has increased, with 13 Palestinians killed by settlers, according to the UN.",
      "More than 850 Palestinians, many of them militants, have been killed by Israeli troops in the West Bank in the same period, the Palestinian health ministry says. The UN says 30 Israelis were killed by Palestinians in the West Bank during that timeframe.",
      "In 2024, the UN recorded about 1,420 incidents of Israeli settler violence \u2013 the highest number that reportedly led to casualties, property damage or both, since records began in 2006.",
      "Additional attacks on Palestinians had occurred since US President Donald Trump's return to power, Basel said, and the filmmakers feared it could worsen.",
      "Trump has lifted sanctions the Biden administration had placed on some settlers. The president's ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said Israel has a \"title deed\" to the West Bank and \"there's no such thing\" as occupation or settlements.",
      "When asked on Tuesday whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would make an announcement in four weeks' time.",
      "The debate over Masafer Yatta began in the 1980s when Israel declared the area a closed military firing zone, meaning no one was allowed to live there.",
      "According to notes from a 1981 meeting, then-Israeli Agricultural Minister Ariel Sharon offered the military additional training areas to restrict the \"expansion of the Arab villagers from the hills towards the desert\".",
      "Israel argued residents previously did not live there permanently. The Palestinian population took their case to Israel's Supreme Court, arguing communities had lived there for generations and pointing to a 1945 map showing some villages.",
      "In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Israel and allowed the demolition of homes and expulsion of more than 1,000 villagers.",
      "Scenes from the film show a bulldozer destroying a primary school, a truck pouring mud into a well, and machinery crushing a home as villagers confront the army.",
      "A girl cries, and when her mother is asked if she has any other place to go she says: \"We have no other land.\"",
      "The documentary also records intimate human moments, like when the mother, who moves into a cave, kisses her daughter and tells her: \"You're my love... Tomorrow will be a new day.\"",

      "\"I have so much money now that I could hire someone to kill you, and nobody would know. No-one would miss you. No-one would know anything.\"",
      "Former music executive Daniel Evans says he can still remember the threat from his old boss, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs - then known as Puff Daddy - to a colleague. It was 1997, he says, in the New York office of Combs's Grammy Award-winning music label Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"It was like, this is what money does to you,\" he says.",
      "Combs was often \"prickly\", but Evans says power was transforming him. Just days before, the hip-hop mogul had received his biggest reward to date \u2013 $6m (\u00a34.8m) to mark the label's success, which boasted platinum-selling artists like The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "That year Combs's music career reached its peak, with his empire soon expanding into fashion, alcohol and even his own TV network.",
      "Nearly three decades on, his legacy is in ruins as he sits in jail awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering alongside battling dozens of lawsuits accusing him of drugging and assault at lavish parties, high-end hotels and in his label's recording studio. He denies all the allegations.",
      "Now the BBC has spoken to more than 20 people who worked with Combs at Bad Boy Records - including former executives, assistants and producers - who describe for the first time troubling incidents they say they witnessed during its 1990s rise.",
      "Some executives say they had concerns after seeing Combs having sex with women in the studio, including one incident where the employee says the young woman did not seem to react when he walked in. Another staff member complained Combs asked her to bring him condoms.",
      "The BBC also heard that corporate funds were used to fly in women from across the US for sex at the request of artists and other employees.",
      "\"There was a course of conduct that became more egregious over time and that conduct does go back to the 90s,\" says Tony Buzbee, a US lawyer representing dozens of alleged victims, including one who says Combs threatened to kill her in similar terms to the incident Evans says he witnessed.",
      "His client alleges Combs raped her on a bathroom floor at a promotional party held for The Notorious B.I.G., the label's biggest star, in 1995. She says in her lawsuit that afterwards, Combs told her not to tell anyone or \"you will disappear\".",
      "In a statement, Combs's legal team accused Buzbee of being \"more interested in media attention than the truth\" and said the hip-hop star \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone\".",
      "The 55-year-old's lawyers said they had not been provided with sufficient details about the BBC's claims to present the facts that would \"counter these fabricated accusations\".",
      "\"As we've said before, Mr Combs cannot dignify every publicity stunt or facially absurd claim with a response. He has full confidence in the judicial process, where the truth will prevail: these accusations are pure fiction,\" they said.",
      "A brash go-getter, Sean Combs became an overnight millionaire when he launched Bad Boy Records in 1993 with a roster of top artists.",
      "It was Combs's first venture, having already built a name for himself as a talent director at another music label, Uptown Records, aged 19.",
      "\"He said that he wanted to be one of the biggest artists in the world and it didn't matter if I believed him or not,\" remembers Jimmy Maynes, a former Uptown colleague.",
      "Maynes remembers Combs having a short fuse in the office, sometimes banging \"his hands up against the desk\" like a \"bratty kid\" and yelling if he did not get his way.",
      "Combs was eventually fired from Uptown and at the age of 23 started Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"He's the hardest working man that I've ever met and always wanted people to match his energy,\" says Daniel Evans, a senior executive who managed Bad Boy's recording budgets and artists' contracts between 1994 and 1997.",
      "Combs described himself as the \"Great Gatsby\" and swiftly became known for hosting coveted celebrity bashes at New York nightclubs, on the beaches of Cancun, Mexico, and later infamous \"White Parties\" - named after the all-white dress code - in the Hamptons.",
      "Even President Donald Trump attended events in the 90s, says Evans, who once saw him sit on a golden throne at Combs's 30th birthday and exclaim: \"I'm the real King of New York!\"",
      "\"We were all really young. I was 24 years old,\" reflects Evans, who was one of the label's original employees. \"People wanted to party, have fun, hook up and build good memories.\"",
      "But looking back, Evans says he is troubled by some of the things he witnessed about his boss's behaviour and the company culture.",
      "In about 1995, he says he walked in on Combs having sex with a young woman at Daddy's House, Bad Boy's New York recording studio near Times Square.",
      "\"I was getting ready to go home for the night and looking for my jacket. Open the door and he's having sex with this girl,\" says Evans, who thought the studio was empty as it was silent. Combs swore and shouted at him to leave. \"I thought I was getting fired,\" he says.",
      "Evans remembers the young woman had been brought to the studio, presumably for a tour, by a party-promoter who was a friend of Combs. His boss seemed sober, while she was quiet and did not really talk, he says, wondering if she was high on drugs or just shy.",
      "He says it did not seem unusual at the time. But recalling how the woman did not react when he entered the room, he says: \"Knowing what I know now, there's a lot of speculation about what state she was in\u2026 usually both parties are very responsive during the act.\"",
      "Felicia Newsome, the manager of Daddy's House recording studio between 1994 and 2000, says inappropriate conduct in the music industry as a whole was rife at the time.",
      "\"It was abnormal if somebody reported it, but it wasn't abnormal for it to be happening,\" she says.",
      "Newsome says an employee once called her to the studio in the middle of the night because Combs was in his underwear, about to have sex with a model and another woman. He was demanding the staff member fetch him condoms, she recalls.",
      "\"I said to Puffy, don't ever ask anyone here to go and get condoms,\" says Newsome, who arrived while they were getting dressed again. \"He replied: 'I didn't need anything like that, ma,' and never did it again.\"",
      "Newsome, then in her 30s, says she found Combs reasonable and that he changed his behaviour when she challenged him. On one occasion, when the studio first opened in 1995, she says Combs was unhappy about the look of the countertops and called her a \"bitch\" in front of staff.",

      "She says she demanded a public apology and temporarily shut the studio, asking him: \"If I'm bringing women into this space, which is open 24 hours, how do you want to treat people?\"",
      "Combs responded that he wanted it to be an inclusive and safe environment, she says.",
      "But while Newsome ran the studio with an \"iron fist\", she says other staff were less comfortable calling Combs out.",
      "\"Bad Boy Records was a crazy house with a lot of young people who wanted to touch the King's robes,\" she says.",
      "Former staff say the label was run by twenty-something executives and a large number of interns, some of whom were of school age. There were often sexual relationships between employees and the interns, they say.",
      "Evans remembers an uncomfortable moment with a 14-year-old in his own team, who he says propositioned him.",
      "\"She says to me, you work really hard. If you ever want to like, get loose, you and I should kick it\u2026 but not tonight, I have a curfew.\"",
      "Evans says he sent her home and called the next day, telling her not to return to work. He did not report her, but two weeks later she was back working in the mailroom.",
      "Artists and other employees at Combs's record label would sometimes also request for women to be flown in to have sex at the studio, the former executive says.",
      "\"If they had a [sexual] specialty in something, they would be flown in,\" says Evans, who told the BBC he knew because he controlled the budgets. Money for the flights would be set aside and logged under travel, he adds.",
      "\"It was probably like thousands of dollars,\" says Evans. \"I don't think it happened all that often, but it was definitely a recording expense.\"",
      "Evans says Combs's own requests were managed by his personal assistants. One told the BBC that Combs would often ask them to fly in women he was \"messing around with\" and put them up in hotels, though the assistant said they were not sex workers.",
      "In the 2000s, the Daddy's House recording studio further changed, two former staff say, into a culture of \"sex, drugs and rock'n'roll\". Combs would regularly bring \"random women\" there to party, turning up with an entourage of dozens of people in \"three white jeeps, with white rims and white leather seats\", they say. Other artists would demand suitcases of Ciroc vodka and one even brought a monkey to a session, according to a former executive.",
      "The studio is one of the locations where women have since accused Combs of drugging and raping them. Model Crystal McKinney alleges the mogul plied her with alcohol and marijuana before sexually assaulting her there in 2003. That same year, a woman alleges that Combs and two associates gang raped her at the studio when she was 17.",
      "Combs's lawyers say he \"looks forward to proving his innocence\", adding that McKinney's claims are \"without merit\".",
      "Many ex-staff say they still find it hard to reconcile the allegations with the man they knew. \"These accusations are a surprise to me, as I am sure it is to many of our circle,\" says Jeffery Walker, a close friend of Combs who was part of Bad Boy's original production team. \"I've been to White Parties and of course studio sessions, and none of what he is accused of went down in my sight.\"",
      "Evans was also sceptical about some of the claims until he saw the footage of Casandra Ventura, Combs's ex-partner of 10 years and a former Bad Boy artist, being brutally beaten by the rapper in a hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Ventura was the first person to sue Combs back in November 2023, alleging that he had trapped her in a cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking during their relationship. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day for an undisclosed amount.",
      "\"It's not the first time I've seen that temper,\" recalls Evans, thinking back to the death threat he says he witnessed back in 1997. \"It's hard to see. The guy in the video with Cassie is almost identical to the guy who threatened the employee. So, you wonder, has anything changed?\"",
      "Over the years, Sean Combs has repeatedly reinvented himself - from Puff Daddy, to P Diddy and in recent years, \"Love\".",
      "\"If I'm acting crazy, like 'ahhh!' that's Diddy. If I'm dancing real smooth with a girl, that's Puff Daddy. And if I'm looking like I'm nervous or scared or shy, that's Sean,\" he said in an interview in 2015.",
      "With more details likely to emerge when he goes on trial in May, many of those who were close to the rapper are questioning whether they knew the real Sean Combs at all.",
      "\"One could think that he's just a disgusting human being, but that's not my memory of Puff,\" says Jimmy Maynes, who grew up with Combs in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "But after a pause, he adds: \"Or maybe money just gives people the freedom to be exactly who they really are, and he was that guy all along.\"",

      "One of US President Donald Trump's first actions after returning to office was signing an executive order pausing almost all foreign assistance for 90 days while a review could be carried out. He has said USAID is run by \"radical left lunatics\" and is getting away with \"tremendous fraud\" - without giving evidence.",
      "Mr Sherembey, who heads 100% Life, the largest patient-led organisation in Ukraine, recalls that when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, warehouses storing HIV medication were bombed.",

      "\"USAID's slogan is that this is assistance from the American people. But it turns out that this aid could be stopped by the decision of one person,\" he says.",
      "USAID was established in 1961 by President John F Kennedy. It has around 10,000 employees and a budget of nearly $40bn (\u00a332.25bn), out of a total of $68bn in US government foreign aid spending.",
      "It has bases in more than 60 countries, and works in dozens of others. However, most of the work on the ground is carried out by other organisations that it contracts and funds.",

      "\"If an opposition figure, a university student, or a women's rights activist is arrested in Iran, it is NGOs like the one I work for that immediately act so the person's email and social media accounts are locked and removed,\" says the activist, who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisals.",

      "As the head of the nascent Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), Musk has emerged as a dominant force in the dizzying start to Trump's second administration.",
      "In just two weeks he has led efforts to seize access to the federal payment system, dismantled an entire agency and offered millions of civil servants an ultimatum - quit or face being fired.",

      "But unhappy with Biden's position on issues from labour laws to transgender rights, Musk began to look to the other side of the aisle in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election.",
      "Initially, Musk called for Trump to \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset\" and had backed his rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, for the Republican nomination. But he soon became the president's biggest booster, contributing $288m to Trump and other Republican candidates and becoming a key adviser on the campaign.",

      "\"He's only concerned with the objective at hand. I think he views interpersonal issues and conflicts as ancillary things that are not worth his time,\" he said.",
      "Occasionally, Musk tended toward the impulsive. The manager recalled seeing Musk fire a fellow Tesla employee on the spot over an overflowing rubbish can.",
      "\"He interpreted that as a sign that this person didn't take as much pride in his work as he should,\" he said. \"That was the nuance to it\u2026 but at the end of the day someone got fired because they admitted that their trash can was overflowing.\"",
      "The approach yielded a committed workforce, the employee said. If you were on board with Musk's mission, that single-minded focus was motivating, he said, and helped fuel regular 13 plus-hour days on the job.",
      "\"He can get more out of people than anyone else I have ever seen,\" he recalled, although he added that the intensity at Tesla was par for the course in Silicon Valley.",
      "But for those in the federal government, the employee added, \"it's gotta be a culture shock.\"",

      "Congress has established USAID as an independent agency, and the legislative branch appropriates funding.",

      "\"I'm supportive of the Trump administration's efforts to reform and restructure the agency in a way that better serves US national security interests,\" said Senator James Risch, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",

      "\"I think we've just had a very exciting moment,\" Marc Benioff, the billionaire founder and CEO of Salesforce who has been vocal in his support of Trump, told the BBC in December. \"It's a new chapter for America.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of incredible people like Elon Musk in the tech industry and in the business community. And if you can tap the power of expertise to make the best of America, that's a great vision,\" he said at the time.",

      "Dr Philip Low, a neuroscientist and CEO of neurotechnology company Neurovigil, said Musk's playbook could wreak havoc on governmental institutions. The two were close for nearly 15 years before their relationship soured, he said.",
      "\"His pattern is to take companies, invest in them, destabilise them, and then take them over,\" said Dr Low, citing Twitter as an example.",

      "\"We heard three shots, one after the another, and panicked. My teacher shouted: 'shut the doors, lock them and hide,'\" she tells Sweden's TV4 News.",
      "Police have not formally named the attacker but he has been identified as Rickard Andersson, 35, by Sweden's public broadcaster SVT.",

      "They also do not believe the attack was motivated by terrorism.",
      "\"It's a changing situation. The information we gave earlier is still valid, but may change later,\" said local police chief Roberto Eid Forest.",

      "\"The building got hijacked. There were no utilities, so most of the people were actually throwing their trash right inside the building, until it reached the 14th floor,\" said Delight Sithole, who runs tours of the building.",
      "He added: \"There were some dead bodies here, illegal firearms, drugs. The smell, I'm sure it was just horrible, just really like, hell on earth.",
      "\"If you asked anybody what happens in that round building, somebody would have something interesting or scary to say about it,\" said Sifiso Zikhali, who works with Mr Sithole in an organisation called Dlala Nje, which means \"just play\" in Zulu.",
      "\"People were scared of the neighbourhood,\" he said.",
      "Johannesburg was seen as being one of the most dangerous cities in the world.",
      "But the building turned itself around 15 years ago in the wake of the Fifa World Cup hosted in South Africa, and people started moving back in.",
      "After Covid, people returned and the building is now around three-quarters full.",
      "There is no escaping the issues that Johannesburg, and South Africa, face.",
      "Despite signs of improvement in the most recent statistics, crime is still a major issue.",

      "A few days later, on a tour of one of Ithemba's flagship residential developments called Jewel City, senior manager Alan Tait explains the turnaround.",
      "\"The demand is just phenomenal, and that demand is specifically to live in the CBD,\" he said.",

      "Named after its origins as a diamond dealing district, like the Ponte building the area fell into disrepair, only to see a resurgence.",
      "\"We launched Jewel City about five years ago, just as Covid was hitting. So the timing was a little bit out. But as soon as Covid lifted, the buildings filled up quite quickly,\" he said.",

      "It was part of an initiative by a group called JoziMyJozi which started in 2023. One of its first projects was to light up the Nelson Mandela bridge, a centrepiece of the city, that meant people once again found it safe to use.",

      "Could Johannesburg one day be spoken about like London, Paris or New York?",
      "\"Well, that is the intention,\" said Ms Swanepoel. \"Much of what's happening in Joburg is due to perceptions. We have a long way to go. I mean, there's no doubt about that, but it's not impossible. We need to get up there and be the gold standard for cities in Africa.\"",

    "story": [
      "A badly burnt scroll from the Roman town of Herculaneum has been digitally \"unwrapped\", providing the first look inside for 2,000 years.",
      "The document, which looks like a lump of charcoal, was charred by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD and is too fragile to ever be physically opened.",
      "But now scientists have used a combination of X-ray imaging and artificial intelligence to virtually unfurl it, revealing rows and columns of text.",
      "More work is needed to make the scroll fully legible to decipher its contents, but the team behind the project say the results are very promising.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" said Stephen Parsons, project lead for the Vesuvius Challenge, an international competition attempting to unlock the Herculaneum scrolls.",
      "Some letters are already clearly visible in the ancient text and the team believes it's a work of philosophy.",
      "Hundreds of carbonised scrolls were discovered in Herculaneum, which like its neighbour Pompeii was buried beneath metres of volcanic ash.",
      "In the past, some of the documents, which are made from a thick paper-like material called papyrus, were prised open but they crumbled into pieces.",
      "The University of Oxford's Bodleian Library holds several of the scrolls. Thought to be unreadable, they had been left untouched for decades.",
      "\"We've never been convinced before that any of the techniques would be safe enough or effective enough to get any information from the scrolls,\" explained Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation.",
      "But the promise of a hi-tech solution prompted the team to get one of the precious scrolls out of storage.",
      "It was placed in a specially made case and taken to Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire.",
      "Inside this huge machine, which is called a synchrotron, electrons are accelerated to almost the speed of light to produce a powerful X-ray beam that can probe the scroll without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimetre,\" explained Adrian Mancuso, director of physical sciences at Diamond.",
      "The scan is used to create a 3D reconstruction, then the layers inside the scroll - it contains about 10m of papyrus - have to be identified.",
      "\"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally,\" said Dr Mancuso.",
      "After that artificial intelligence is used to detect the ink. It's easier said than done - both the papyrus and ink are made from carbon and they're almost indistinguishable from each other.",
      "So the AI hunts for the tiniest signals that ink might be there, then this ink is painted on digitally, bringing the letters to light.",
      "\"We can tell the entire scroll is full of text,\" said Stephen Parsons.",
      "\"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "Last year, a Vesuvius Challenge team managed to read about 5% of another Herculaneum scroll.",
      "Its subject was Greek Epicurean philosophy, which teaches that fulfilment can be found through the pleasure of everyday things.",
      "The Bodleian's scroll is likely to be on the same subject - but the Vesuvius team is calling for more human and computing ingenuity to see if this is the case.",
      "For Nicole Gilroy, the work is providing a link to the past.",
      "\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves. There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious,\" she said.",

      "\"What do you think you brought to Elphaba?\" I asked.",
      "\"The vulnerability, her humanity,\" she said.",
      "\"What's that vulnerability for you personally?\"",
      "\"I think always wanting to do well and not wanting to fail, not wanting to let family down. Those are the insecurities. Finally owning how I look.\"",
      "\"What do you mean by that?\"",
      "\"Well, I think we're not necessarily told that, you know, dark-skinned Black girls are the prettiest girls,\" Erivo said. \"And the only person that really is telling you, thankfully, is your mother. It's up to you to figure out that for yourself, and to start owning what beauty is to you.\"",
      "\"You're really close with your mom. You're not with your dad?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"As you've gone on to have more and more success and visibility, how much do you think about your dad?\"",
      "\"I don't necessarily think about him too much, only that I wish him well,\" Erivo said. \"When I was a teenager, [I was] very angry at what that relationship was. That sort of fractured relationship I have with him, I think, originally was one of the driving forces of, you know, you want to do well because you want to prove that you're good enough to be loved. But then, you have to start learning how to do it for you.\"",
      "\"What happened with your dad?\"",
      "\"We had a falling-out that just never repaired,\" she said.",
      "\"And he just left early on?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"It's interesting that you trace some of your desire to find success to a desire to \u2013\"",
      "\"To be loved,\" Erivo said.",
      "The 38-year-old lives in Los Angeles, but grew up in London. \"London really is kind of what made me,\" she said.",
      "Her parents were immigrants from Nigeria. Her mother's drive for a better life was formative. \"My mom made a decision because she wanted more for herself. To do that is a really brave thing. And I think that watching her do that made me do the same \u2013 you sort of are given the tools to be determined enough to go after your dreams.\"",
      "Her roles show range: Her portrayal of abolitionist Harriet Tubman in the 2019 film \"Harriet\" led to her first Academy Award nominations, for best actress and best original song, and secured her a place on the red carpet, where she speaks through another sort of language: fashion. \"I think they're the words without the words,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"What do you feel like you say with how you dress?\"",
      "\"I think I tell people I'm a bit of a daredevil, that I am a kind rebel!\" she replied.",
      "Incredibly, she dared to sing live on the \"Wicked\" set while flying in a harness.",
      "I asked, \"How does singing live in a film like that change the final product?\"",
      "\"Well, you can play,\" she said. \"It means that you can act on impulse. \u2026 You have more breath, more space.\"",
      "\"It lets the performance change?\"",
      "\"That's right. Moment to moment.\"",
      "\"And presumably it lets more of you \u2013\"",
      "\"\u2026 out!\"",
      "Lately, Erivo is letting more of herself out \u2013 releasing an album later this year. Then, there's part two of \"Wicked,\" opening in November.",
      "\"I feel really open,\" she said. \"I felt more myself then ever in this sort of last couple of years. It makes things a lot more fun, you know?\"",
      "\"And maybe gives another meaning or undertone or something to this 'defying gravity'?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, yeah! It's kind of using the things that you thought would hold you back to soar!\"",

    "title": "Pitch perfect: Commercial spokespeople talk about their TV fame",
    "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2025 12:50:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Stephanie Courtney (Flo, the Progressive Insurance saleswoman), Dean Winters (Mayhem, of Allstate insurance commercials), and Deanna Colon (the unstoppable dancer in Jardiance diabetes drug ads) talk about their fame as pitch people.",
    "story": [
      "You know those Progressive Insurance commercials? Comedian Stephanie Courtney has played Flo the Insurance Woman in 215 ads, so far. She's helped turn Progressive into America's second-largest insurance company.",
      "She is, by any measure, one of the most successful actors in the world \u2013 on television nonstop for 16 years, with face recognition by the public, and the money that goes with it. \"I'm not gonna fight you on that!\" Courtney laughed. \"Even though in my head I'm like, What?\"",
      "I asked, \"What does it mean when you go out in public? Do people harass you? Want selfies?\"",
      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",
      "\"And so, that's the first clue about, like, who is she, how crazy can she get,\" she said.",
      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",
      "But if anyone knows about the ups and downs of showbiz, it's Deanna Colon. \"I am a 360-degree entertainer, singer, songwriter, vocal coach,\" she said. \"If you want to be in the world of entertainment, you have to do it all.\"",
      "Colon was on \"America's Got Talent,\" and she's appeared in ads for Pepsi and Big Lots. But the biggest break she ever got was the Jardiance commercial.",
      "\"I have Type 2 diabetes, but I manage it well, it's a little pill with a big story to tell!\"",
      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dean Winters will be Mayhem for as long as Allstate will have him. \"You know, I really hope that I'm doing it until Mayhem is wheelchair racing in a nursing home, you know what I mean?\" he laughed.",
      "As for Stephanie Courtney, she's given up her youthful dreams of appearing on Broadway or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But she still performs every week with The Groundlings improv group.",
      "And she still loves being Flo. \"I will tell you, the thing that made my heart grow three sizes that day was the Halloween costumes, seeing, especially like little kids, I love it so much,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm like, 'Just keep reapplying powder, reapply your lipstick. Go forth, be free, go spread the word!'\" Courtney laughed.",

    "summary": "The beloved weekly magazine encompassing journalism, fiction, poetry and cartoons, is celebrating its centenary. New Yorker writer Kelefa Sanneh goes inside the magazine's history to explore its longevity, national reach, and idiosyncratic appeal.",
    "story": [
      "The New Yorker, the beloved weekly magazine, is celebrating its one-hundredth birthday. I have been a staff writer at the magazine since 2008, and Bruce Diones has been at The New Yorker since, well, not quite since the beginning. \"1978,\" he said. \"I was in the cradle. They left me on the doorstep and I came.\"",
      "Asked his title, Diones replied , \"I don't really have one. I aid and abet all the crimes that happen here. I'm that guy that's always around.\"",
      "\"An expert on both the people and the magazine?\"",
      "\"That's right.\"",
      "\"You can tell me what we published in 1979, but you can also tell me who's mad at whom?\"",
      "\"Yeah, and I can tell you why they're mad at them and why that thing in '79 didn't work out!\" he laughed.",
      "The New Yorker is known for its reporting, and for its idiosyncrasies. Each issue also includes cartoons, a short story, and a few poems. The front cover features not a photograph, but a painting.",
      "One of Diones' many responsibilities is to organize the magazine's archive. \"We have every magazine, every issue since the first one. We have scrapbooks, papers and all sorts of weird little ephemera from the people's offices. It's kind of fun, interesting stuff.\"",
      "The New Yorker may be America's leading literary magazine, but its story starts with an artist: Rea Irvin. \"All the artwork in The New Yorker is based on his work,\" Diones said.",
      "Irvin did the cover of the first issue published on February 21, 1925, of a fancy young man in a top hat, inspecting a butterfly. His name is Eustace Tilley, and he became the magazine's mascot, for better or worse.",
      "\"At long last, I'm gonna tell you that I'm ambivalent about Eustace Tilley,\" said editor David Remnick. \"Because some people look at it and they think it's a symbol of snobbery, or overweening pride. When it began, it was meant to be a joke about snobbery.\"",
      "Remnick was a 39-year-old reporter when, in 1998, he was named the fifth editor of The New Yorker. His job is to keep the writers happy, and, as he sometimes reminds me, productive. His job is also to figure how, and how much, to modernize a 100-year-old magazine that once specialized in light-hearted articles about Manhattan society.",
      "In that first issue of the magazine, founding editor Harold Ross wrote, \"It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.\"",
      "I asked, \"What did he have against Iowa?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Remnick laughed. \"To him, Dubuque included Queens, Los Angeles \u2026\"",
      "The magazine's reach, now, extends far past Manhattan. \"We have more readers in the state of California than we do in the state of New York, including the old lady in Dubuque,\" Remnick said. \"It's a magazine that has deep, deep reporting, and prides itself on accuracy and fact-checking.\"",
      "Fergus McIntosh leads the magazine's battalion of fact-checkers \u2013 more than two dozen.",
      "So, what is a fact-checker? \"Somebody who takes a story submitted by someone like you and, before we publish it, makes sure that it is accurate, balanced, fair, and as complete as it can be,\" McIntosh said.",
      "\"Fair? That seems like a hard thing to figure out,\" I said.",
      "\"I know that's hard for you. It's not hard for us,\" McIntosh laughed.",
      "And everything gets checked \u2013 not just articles, but also poems, short stories, even cartoons. Teresa Matthews, the department's associate director, once had to fact-check a cartoon about a penguin meeting his girlfriend's parents. \"He says, 'We prefer the term Arctic-American,'\" she recalled. \"And this is factually incorrect, because penguins live in the Antarctic.\"",
      "\"But Antarctic-American wouldn't have been as funny,\" I said.",
      "\"Not pithy enough, no,\" said Matthews. \"All of my emails to the wonderful cartoon editor about any potential issues I find, almost always I get a response of, 'Thank you so much, Teresa. We will not be taking that change.'\"",
      "Somewhere along the way, The New Yorker became a serious magazine, publishing writers ranging from J.D. Salinger to James Baldwin, from the film critic Pauline Kael to the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow.",
      "The New York Public Library will celebrate the magazine's anniversary with an exhibition later this month.",
      "So, what is The New Yorker in 2025? Remnick said, \"It's not just one thing. Sports illustrated was about one thing, and it's easy to understand, for advertisers and readers. [The New Yorker] is a more complicated thing. It may be a little bit tricky to invite people in.\"",
      "\"Is The New Yorker itself more political than it used to be?\"",
      "\"I think it's certainly more political than when it started out, that's for damn sure,\" said Remnick.",
      "\"Would it be wrong to describe The New Yorker as a liberal magazine?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think it would be wrong. I think there a wide range. I don't think it's an assertively ideological publication. I think reporting is at its center more than finger-wagging.\"",
      "These are anxious times for the media industry, and The New Yorker is not immune. The magazine had a round of layoffs in 2023. But The New Yorker has a steady base of around 1.2 million subscribers, many of whom read it on their phones. Remnick said, \"How do we write shorter, faster things, as well as do the other things? In addition to; it's not instead of. We have a pretty robust audio operation \u2013 four, five podcasts. We do video. But I'm thinking forward. I'm thinking about how do we have a New Yorker that has the possibility of celebrating 200 years? Because in American life, in the history of media, that's unusual. Just ask the people who used to read Life magazine.\"",
      "For Bruce Diones, The New Yorker's 100th birthday is a good excuse to revisit ancient history. He showed me a box left behind by a former employee named Fred Keefe: \"He was a little guy like me with a bow tie, and he would sit in the corner and type out 'letters to the editor' answers.\"",
      "One letter was a request to visit the magazine's offices. Keefe responded: \"Thank you for your letter. We're afraid there isn't much to see in our offices. The editors and writers are all shut away in little cubicles and are very upset if people pop in on them.\"",
      "In fact, those old editors and writers and artists and cartoonists are still here, in spirit, and also in these boxes. The party's been going for a hundred years, and new people are still being invited to join in.",
      "I said, \"maybe in another 100 years, someone will come and flip through whatever the newest version of that archives is?\"",
      "\"That's right, and I'm in it now,\" laughed Diones. \"And you're in it, too. That's kind of the thrill of it. You realize that, well, oh, this has always been going on, and we're all a part of it.\"",

    "summary": "Pugilism has been a favored subject of artists and photographers since boxers first stepped into the ring. \"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\" an exhibit in West Palm Beach, Fla., captures this most combative of sports.",
    "story": [
      "Muhammed Ali is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time. But he also packed a punch with art works, like this 1967 drawing called \"The Crowd,\" seen from his perspective looking out from the ring, with some in the audience smiling, some frowning. \"I love that part where he is acknowledging that not only did he have fans, but he might have had some haters as well,\" said curator Arden Sherman.",
      "Four of Ali's works are prominently featured in \u00a0\"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\"\u00a0at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida. It's an exhibition devoted to boxing \u2013 winners, losers, and everything in-between.",
      "Sherman says the show explores a host of different aspects about this most accessible of sports: \"It's rare to encounter a human of a certain age on this planet that doesn't have an understanding of the sport of boxing,\" she said.",
      "Artists do seem to gravitate toward boxing. There are more than 100 works on display here \u2013 paintings, photographs and sculptures \u2013 including many by and about women. One work by Zoe Buchman features frilly fabrics on boxing gloves. Sherman said. \"She's someone who is consistently standing up for female rights and female empowerment.\"",
      "Sherman says the exhibit comes at a very auspicious time: \"I believe, as humans, we find ourselves fighting for something or defending another thing. It is a contentious moment we live in, and what better way to express that but through the symbolism granted to us through the sport of boxing.\"",
      "So, the give-and-take in works like this, by George Bellows, perhaps America's best-known painter of boxing, seems to take on new meaning.",
      "This 1923 work, called \"Introducing John L. Sullivan,\" depicts not just a famous boxer and the announcer, but also the promoters, money makers, and wheeler-dealers behind all of it.",
      "The exhibit features some heavyweight artists: There's Roy Lichtenstein's \"Sweet Dreams Baby!\" from 1965, and Keith Haring's late 1980s painted steel sculpture.",
      "Sherman says the artists are \"thinking about love, violence, fantasy, death. \u2026 I think the artists are thinking about being alive. I think they are thinking about their own identity, and how they navigate that in this world.\"",
      "Among the most recent works is a pair of paintings from 2023 by Jared McGriff. \"One of the things about boxing and this act of being in a battle is that it can be disorienting,\" he said. \"The thing that I think about with these two works is this idea of internal struggle and the idea of what it takes from an internal determination and focus standpoint to reach this level of athleticism.\"",
      "There are also flashes of humor, such as Michael Halsband's 1985 photo of artists Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat in boxing gear:",
      "... or Harry Benson's famous shot of a very young Muhammad Ali meeting the very young Beatles in a Miami gym on their first trip to the U.S., in 1964:",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2025 06:59:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Brands are paying millions to air their commercials during Super Bowl 2025. Here's what's behind the cost, and why advertisers say it's worth it.",
    "story": [
      "On the eve of Super Bowl 59, the\u00a0Philadelphia Eagles\u00a0and\u00a0Kansas City Chiefs\u00a0aren't the only ones dreaming of touchdowns. Brands and advertisers with millions riding on the success of commercials to be aired during the 2025 Super Bowl broadcast are also hoping to score. Here's a look at how much money goes into Super Bowl ads, and why advertisers say the high-cost commercials are worth it.",
      "How much do Super Bowl commercials cost on average for 2025?",
      "Advertisers are shelling out close to $8 million on average for a 30-second spot during Super Bowl LIX, Peter Bray, founder and executive creative director at ad agency Bray & Co., told CBS MoneyWatch. He estimates that around 51 minutes of advertising has been sold for the approximately three to four hour broadcast this year, making the total amount of ad sales somewhere in the hundreds of millions.",
      "Want to watch Super Bowl 2025 commercials early? These ads are already live.",
      "Want to watch Super Bowl 2025 commercials early? These ads are already live.",
      "The close to $8 million price tag is almost a million dollars more than the $7 million it cost for a 30-second spot in Super Bowl 2024. Commercial air time during the NFL Championship in 2023 was also about $7 million for 30 seconds, a 55% jump from 2019. Super Bowl advertising costs are \"creeping up,\" said Bray, who believes ad sales for the broadcast will soon reach $1 billion.",
      "\"I think in three years it's going to hit a billion dollars in ad sales. And that has never before happened on the planet. That is the immensity of this event,\" he said.",
      "Why are Super Bowl ads so expensive?",
      "\"It's the advertising industry's Super Bowl as well,\" Bray said. \"It's the one time of year where the general public actually cares about advertising so it's an exciting time.\"",
      "And social media, he says, has only made the broadcast more important.",
      "\"It's actually made advertising in the Super Bowl more relevant than ever because what's happened is with all these different platforms, it's very difficult to find a large audience at once,\" Bray said. \"Someone might advertise as an advertiser on TikTok, or on Instagram ... all of these different advertising opportunities. But you might be duplicating because the audience on TikTok, maybe 90% are the same audience on Instagram, so there's a lot of duplication.\"",
      "More than 120 million people are expected to watch Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, which will be broadcast on Fox and\u00a0livestreamed for free\u00a0on Tubi. To keep those viewers transfixed, brands will try to use humor, emotion or a famous actor to create a cultural moment that a mass audience can engage with collectively.",
      "\"Comedy can be a safe route for brands, and you don't want to divide your audience at all, so comedy makes sense. There's more celebrities being used than ever,\" Bray said.",
      "Depending on a celebrity's level of fame, they can add anywhere from less than $50,000 for a brief cameo to millions of dollars. Bray said he estimates the tab for most stars that appear in a Super Bowl spot to be in the $2 million range.",
      "Dunkin' spends big \u2014 and wins",
      "For his role in a Dunkin' ad last year, meanwhile, Ben Affleck was paid nearly $10 million, CNN reported; it was his second appearance in a Super Bowl commercial for the global donut and coffee giant.",
      "Dunkin' first featured Affleck \u2014 a Boston native and actual Dunkin' donuts fan \u2014 in its inaugural Super Bowl ad in 2023. The 30-second spot, which included a cameo of his then wife, Jennifer Lopez, garnered 7 billion impressions for the company after its first airing, according to Dunkin' President Scott Murphy in a 2024 interview with Entreprenuer magazine. The ad was produced by\u00a0 Artists Equity, a company founded by Affleck and Matt Damon in 2022.",
      "A multipart campaign followed,\u00a0including\u00a0a promotion featuring Gen Z rapper Ice Spice. The storyline culminated with Dunkin's 2024 Super Bowl ad, a comedic 60-second spot that introduces the characters The DunKings, an aspirational rap group Affleck forms with Matt Damon and Tom Brady, dressed in bright orange and pink track suits.",
      "One year and many\u00a0sold-out track suits later, Dunkin' and Affleck return for their third Super Bowl ad collaboration, which\u00a0features\u00a0Casey Affleck and \"Succession\" star Jeremy Strong.",
      "\"Ben Affleck is a great combination with Dunkin',\" said Bray, \"Not because of him as an actor or director, but how he's perceived in popular culture. \"Jeremy Strong from 'Succession,' he's a kooky guy, but he's known as a method actor. Dunkin' know this ... they're connecting who these celebrities are as people rather than actors to the brands. And that makes for a really powerful ad.\"",
      "How much did Super Bowl commercials cost in past years?",
      "Super Bowl ads go back to the first Super Bowl in 1967. Two networks aired the game, with a 30-second spot costing $37,500 on NBC and $42,500 on CBS, according to a timeline of ad prices listed on SportingNews.com. Ad prices for the most part have steadily increased since then, with the cost for a half-minute ad breaking $1 million in 1995 and reaching $5 million in 2017.",
      "What is the most expensive Super Bowl ad ever aired?",
      "The most expensive Super Bowl commercial of all time is Amazon's \"Mind Reader\" ad, which aired during Super Bowl LVI in 2022. Featuring real-life couple Scarlett Johansson and comedian Colin Jost from \"SNL,\" the 90-second spot is reported to have cost $26 million to produce, according to experience management site Qualtrics.",
      "What is the cheapest Super Bowl ad ever aired?",
      "The cheapest Super Bowl ad ever made appears to be a commercial by a startup company called LifeMinders.com that aired in 2000. The 30-second ad was made by three internal freelancers with a budget of less than $5,000, according to video marketing platform Wistia.",
      "Offering \"highly personalized emails on topics you ask for,\" the endearingly low-budget spot drew 700,000 people to its website in the week following the Super Bowl, according to AdAge. Sadly, it appears the company is no longer in business as the domain name is listed as\u00a0available.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2025 10:21:29 -0500",
    "summary": "A program begun in Zimbabwe in which grandmothers and older listeners serve as \"first responders\" for those seeking mental health assistance in underserved communities has now expanded to nine countries, including the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Dixon Chibanda remembers like yesterday the moment in 2005 that changed his life. \"During my formative years working as a psychiatrist, I lost a patient of mine to suicide. Erica was her name. She had hanged herself from a mango tree in the family garden.\"",
      "Erica was just 25 years old.",
      "Chibanda, a psychiatrist based in Harare, Zimbabwe, says her family knew she needed help. \"They lived some 200 miles away from where I worked,\" he said. \"And they just didn't have the equivalent of US$15 to get onto a bus to come to the hospital.\"",
      "At the time, there were only 10 psychiatrists serving 13 million people in Zimbabwe. So, Chibanda came up with an idea involving grandmothers: \"These grandmas were actually, you know, the custodians of the local culture and the wisdom, and they were rooted in their communities. And I was like, what if we could train them to be the first port of call for anyone needing to talk in a community?\"",
      "So, in 2006, Chibanda introduced the \"Friendship Bench,\" a talk therapy program that brings mental healthcare directly into underserved communities. The program is free, and the grandmothers were happy to donate their time.",
      "He chronicled this journey in a new book: \"The Friendship Bench: How Fourteen Grandmothers Inspired a Mental Health Revolution\" (New World Library).",
      "\"When I first started this, in fact we called it the Mental Health Bench,\" he said. \"Interestingly, nobody came to the Mental Health Bench, because of the stigma, until the grandmas said, 'You know, why don't you turn it into a Friendship Bench?'\"",
      "During that first year, 14 volunteer grandmothers shared a Friendship Bench with several hundred visitors in that one suburb. Chibanda says the program has since expanded beyond grandmothers to include over 3,000 older listeners who last year saw more than 300,000 people all over Zimbabwe.",
      "He said, \"There are a lot of people out there who are struggling to just connect with another human being. And this gives them that opportunity, to be able to sit down with someone who is empathic.\"",
      "Globally, just under 300 million people are struggling with depression, according to the World Health Organization. Only about one-third of them receive any treatment. And at a time when we're facing an epidemic of loneliness and isolation affecting 1 in 5 American adults (according to a 2024 Gallup poll), the Friendship Bench is hitting the road, expanding to vulnerable communities in 9 countries and counting, including the United States.",
      "At the Washington Seniors Wellness Center, in our nation's capital, the program is being piloted by the nonprofit organization HelpAge USA, which focuses on the inclusion of older people.",
      "Seventy-four-year-old Arnette Ibitayo says she was struggling with the deaths of her son and brother. \"My son's was sudden; he had a heart attack at 44,\" she said. \"And then my brother had COVID.\"",
      "She turned to the Friendship Bench. \"So I'm, you know, feeling down, depressed,\" she said. \"I think I need to talk to somebody, because I felt like isolating and staying home. And it was very comforting to get it out. And I wasn't judged, and I was able to speak freely, and the person gave me some helpful advice.\"",
      "That person was Theresa Kelly, a retired schoolteacher, who listened to Ibitayo's story. \"We don't solve problems for them,\" Kelly said. \"Sometimes you don't realize that you can be your own problem solver. And when they finish, we want them to leave empowered.\"",
      "A screening process refers more serious cases to professionals. For almost 20 years now, Dr. Chibanda has been using his medical training to help analyze and improve the program. \"The Friendship Bench is actually rooted in a lot of research,\" he said. \"These grandmas were a lot more effective than trained mental health professionals at alleviating symptoms of both depression and generalized anxiety disorders.\"",
      "Arnette Ibitayo said she felt better after just one session with Kelly: \"I was more at ease. It worked. It was working.\"",
      "\"You feel a little less depressed now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, uh-huh. There's hope that things are going to be better.\"",
      "So, what's the special sauce when it comes to grandparents? According to Chibanda, it is \"the natural abilities that come with having a long-lived life on the planet. They've seen a lot. They've experienced a lot. They have, you know, the battle scars of life, which they bring to the bench. All we're doing as Friendship Bench is helping them to use those stories, those experiences, to help others.\"",
      "And the bench is giving them something back. Theresa Kelly said, \"I love helping people, empowering people. It makes me feel good. Makes me feel that [I have] still another purpose, that after retirement there's still something, you know, that I can do that can help others, that it's not over.\"",

    "summary": "The CDC says respiratory illness is now \"very high\" nationwide.",
    "story": [
      "Levels of influenza nationwide are now at the highest they have been since the peak of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, according to figures published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, amid this winter's second wave of the virus.",
      "Close to 8% of visits for respiratory illness to outpatient providers, including urgent cares and doctors offices, reported to the CDC this week were people sick with influenza. That is the worst on record in the CDC's influenza surveillance network since late 2009, during the swine flu pandemic.",
      "While most flu seasons usually see a resurgence of infections after the winter holidays, this winter's flu wave has now reached unusually high levels compared to recent years.",
      "That has driven overall levels of respiratory illness to \"very high\" levels for the first time this season, despite a smaller and now-decreasing wave of COVID-19 in recent months.",
      "Other influenza metrics are also far above recent peaks nationwide, including in emergency rooms and from testing laboratories. Data collected by the CDC from labs found 31.6% of tests last week were positive for influenza, close to double the 18.2% at last season's peak.",
      "The CDC says that most states are at \"high\" or \"very high\" levels of influenza activity, though some states may have now reached their peak.",
      "Influenza infections are \"likely growing\" in 15 states, the agency's disease forecasters predict, and are either now flat or starting to decline in most other states.",
      "One of the states where influenza is \"likely growing\" is Kentucky, where pediatric infectious specialist Dr. Kris Bryant says she's seeing \"extraordinarily high numbers\" of positive cases in children. At Norton Children's Hospital, there were 3,000 positive cases just last week, she said, calling the uptick \"worrisome.\"",
      "\"We tend to focus on flu as a respiratory viral illness, but some parents don't realize that it can cause seizures, even rarely an inflammation of the brain, and pediatricians are reporting cases of that across the U.S.,\" Bryant said.",
      "Flu vaccination rates in children is at its lowest level in six years, according to the CDC. This year, fewer than half of Americans have been vaccinated. Bryant suspects \"vaccine hesitancy\" could be playing a role in the trend.",
      "Unlike the 2009 pandemic, lab tests around the country suggest cases are still from the usual seasonal variants of the virus, and not a new strain that has spilled over from animals.",
      "While farms have been grappling with a record surge of H5N1 bird flu in poultry driving up egg prices, and a new potentially lethal strain in dairy cows, only a handful of human cases have been confirmed from bird flu in the U.S. Investigations have linked cases to direct contact with sick animals, not human-to-human transmission.",

    "summary": "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration political appointees have taken steps in recent weeks to exert unprecedented influence over the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's flagship medical research publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News. The interference included dictating what to cover and withholding studies on the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "The Trump administration's moves to control the research published by the agency ends a decades-long streak of independence for the journal, known as the MMWR.",
      "Health officials and experts have long considered the MMWR as the \"voice of CDC\" and a respected source where federal scientists release research of public health importance. It ranks as among the most-cited health journals in the world.",
      "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
      "Efforts by Trump officials to control the publication have stalled the release of three studies about bird flu for weeks, as the virus continues spreading through wild birds, poultry farms and cows around the country.",
      "That delay was initially attributed to the communications \"pause\" ordered by the Department of Health and Human Services, which stalled many releases across the government.",
      "Spokespeople for the CDC and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump officials initially said the gag order was needed for the administration to catch up in staffing its public relations team to oversee the vast amount of communications coming out of the nations' federal health agencies.",
      "But as that pause has started to lift, Trump officials at HHS, and acting CDC Director Susan Monarez, refused repeated requests by career health officials to publish the completed research, officials say.",
      "The stalled research includes findings about pet cats owned by dairy workers being infected with bird flu, plus wastewater testing results and antibody testing of cow veterinarians.",
      "Instead, health officials say Monarez relayed orders by the Trump administration to come up with research to publish this week about the health risks from wildfires, days after President Trump criticized California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's handling of fires in the state.",
      "Federal scientists say they scrambled to find studies to comply with the order, which was unexpected and not related to any studies that had been scheduled to come out.",
      "The research that was ultimately published looked at exposure to worrying chemicals for firefighters who responded to the 2023 wildfires in Hawaii and emergency room visits in Los Angeles during the wildfires.",
      "Multiple health officials said they complied fearing their jobs. Scientists within the agency say they have been bombarded with daily requests to accept the \"fork in the road\" offer to resign by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,\u00a0task force, headed by Elon Musk.",
      "Glimpse at a study taken offline",
      "A technical glitch resulted in a table from one of the bird flu studies accidentally being published on Thursday, before officials scrambled to take it down.",
      "That bird flu study was supposed to lay out the details of an investigation into how two indoor cats could have contracted the virus. One of the cats' owners was a dairy worker who transported unpasteurized raw milk, which health officials warn is one of the main ways that H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading between farms in the U.S.",
      "Multiple federal health officials and outside experts have unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to allow the publication to maintain its independence, citing the importance of allowing federal public health researchers to publish their findings without fearing political interference.",
      "While researchers often have to jump through multiple hoops of \"clearance\" within the agency to satisfy questions and concerns raised by scientists and career health officials about the accuracy of their research, officials said political appointees usually steered clear of meddling in its content.",
      "Now health officials fear that a precedent has been set for the Trump administration to cross further lines in its attempts to influence the research and data published by the CDC.",
      "Previous efforts by Trump-appointed officials to exert control over the publication came under scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Mr. Trump's first term, after aides sought to influence reports at the time.",
      "It is now unclear to co-authors of the bird flu research outside the agency when the research will ever be published, weeks after it was ready to go.",
      "\"The study is completed and was to be published in MMWR last month until the order from the new administration halted communication from CDC,\" K. Fred Gingrich II, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said in an email.",
      "The association had worked with Ohio's health department and the CDC to sample\u00a0the blood of veterinarians who treat cows at an annual conference late last year, looking for antibodies that would help answer an outstanding question: had bird flu cases infected veterinarians under the radar?",

      "Congress created the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "As part of one of the lessons learned from the outbreak, the office was intended to formalize the so-called czar roles that had led efforts across the federal government to prepare and respond to pandemic threats.",
      "Parker was previously the associate dean for Global One Health at Texas A&M University. \"One Health\" refers to the study of how health threats in animals and the environment are closely linked to human health concerns, including how dangerous viruses and bacteria often emerge in animals before spreading to humans.",
      "Spokespeople for the university and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "He has served under Republican and Democratic administrations alike, and was recently head of the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity under the Biden administration. This office was charged with crafting recommendations for new rules governing research that could create riskier pathogens.",

      "\"I've not been a fan of every choice that Donald Trump has made. And I've been very critical of many of them. This one is a very good choice,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, former White House COVID-19 response coordinator under President Biden.",
      "Jha said he had consulted with Parker many times, describing him as widely known within the public health community as \"deeply knowledgeable, serious, not particularly partisan, but really just very focused on important issues.\"",
      "One of the first challenges Parker will have to tackle is the unprecedented spread of bird flu around the country.",
      "In recent months, variants of the virus have decimated the poultry and dairy industries, driven up egg prices and led to concerns about spillovers into humans, including one death in Louisiana.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the office was charged with coordinating the mammoth response operations at HHS agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has struggled to investigate and stomp out spread of the virus in farms.",

      "Parker's selection for the role suggests that President Trump is not planning to do away entirely with the office, a possibility he had raised during his campaign.",
      "Some Trump advisers had suggested that the office might be reorganized into the National Security Council, instead of operating as a standalone team.",

    "summary": "Knobs on ranges can be unintentionally activated, an issue that has proved a hazard with other brands, safety agency says.",
    "story": [
      "About 500,000 ranges sold nationwide are being recalled after dozens of fires burned property, people and pets, LG Electronics said Wednesday in a notice posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The recall involves ranges with front-mounted knobs that can be turned accidentally, with CPSC receiving at least 86 reports of unintentional activation. The recalled ranges have been involved in more than 28 fires, with at least five causing extensive property damage totaling more than $340,000. At least eight minor injuries have been reported, including burns, and at least three of the fires involved the deaths of pets, according to the federal agency.",
      "Found at appliance stores including Best Buy, Costco, The Home Depot, Lowe's, and online at LG.com, the recalled ranges were sold from 2015 through January 2025 for between $1,400 and $2,650, depending on the model. Manufactured in Mexico and Korea by LG Electronics Inc. of Korea, the ranges were imported by the company's U.S. subsidiary, based in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.",
      "Model and serial numbers involved in the recall can be found here.",
      "Owners of the recalled ranges should contact LG for a free warning label and placement instructions. The label reminds consumers to use the lock out/control lock function on the range panel to disable activation of the heating elements when not in use.",
      "\"Keep children and pets away\"",
      "\"Consumers are cautioned to keep children and pets away from the knobs, to check the range knobs to ensure they are off before leaving home or going to bed, and not to leave objects on the range when the range is not in use,\" the recall notice stated.",
      "LG Electronics can be reached at 800-399-3265 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. EST Monday through Friday, or by email at\u00a0lgrange.recall@lge.com, or at\u00a0https://lgecares.com/rangerecall.",
      "The issue seemingly extends beyond one brand, as evidenced by Samsung's summertime recall of more than 1.1 million ranges sold nationwide after about 250 fires injured dozens and killed at least seven pets.",
      "According to the agency, CPSC was \"aware of incidents where houses burned, and people died from house fires started by range knobs accidentally turned on whether from people bumping into the knobs or pets activating the range. The issues affect both gas and electric ranges,\" the federal agency stated in a\u00a0summary\u00a0of a June 27 working group meeting.",
      "Between 2018 and May 30, 2024, CPSC data shows there were 338 incidents involving a range or cooktop accidentally being activated, involving 10 manufacturers. Two of those incidents led to fatalities, while 31 resulted in nonfatal injuries, according to the agency.",
      "\"Additionally, CPSC staff have found two other fatal incidents where a range was accidentally turned on when a knob was bumped, but the manufacturer is unknown.\"",
      "A video taken in 2024 appeared to illustrate the risks, with home security footage showing a dog jumping toward a stove briefly and turning on the burner, with its flames igniting a nearby cardboard box. The Colorado Springs, Colorado, homeowner was treated for smoke inhalation, and the June 26 fire temporarily displaced his family,\u00a0CBS affiliate KKTV reported.",

      "Some health officials in the U.S. fear the shutdown of U.S. Agency for International Development missions may have disastrous results, as the stalling of foreign aid has forced delays in what they said was the \"chaotic\" early U.S. response to Uganda's swelling\u00a0Ebola outbreak.",
      "The outbreak marks Uganda's eighth from an Ebola virus. The first confirmed case in the outbreak was a nurse at a hospital in the nation's capital, Kampala, who contracted Ebola on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21 and died on Jan. 29.",
      "There are now six confirmed and six suspect cases. In two of the suspect cases, according to an internal slide shared with CBS News, health authorities have identified no epidemiological link to the other cases.",
      "More than a dozen Americans in Uganda are also among those so far known to have been exposed to Sudan virus, the type of Ebola that had infected the initial case. Those people so far have not shown symptoms, two people familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "There is no vaccine or treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration for Sudan virus. This Ebola strain has been fatal in at least 41% of reported cases during past outbreaks, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "The new outbreak coincides with the Trump administration's pause in foreign aid \u2014 including its response to international outbreaks that could spread. This has spawned uncertainty among health nonprofits, which now face unpaid debts and a sweeping freeze on much of their U.S. funding.",
      "\"What we're talking about are disaster relief workers, we're talking about health workers and people who are doing good and protecting America around the world,\" Dr. Atul Gawande, a former USAID global health director, told CBS News on Monday.",
      "The pause has resulted in understaffed contact tracing and screening of departing international travelers in Uganda, one U.S. official said, since many experts funded by the U.S. around the region have been laid off or ordered to stop work.",
      "USAID is set to put virtually all its staff on leave this Friday and is shutting down overseas missions.",
      "\"It puts the world at risk,\" said one USAID official in a message. \"I'm not an alarmist, but this is very bad,\" the official added.",
      "In 2022, an outbreak of Sudan virus in Uganda prompted a large American response. The U.S.\u00a0ramped up\u00a0screening and preparedness for the virus here and sent\u00a0staff and resources\u00a0to aid Uganda's efforts to contain its spread.",
      "Uganda's healthcare system had already been stretched thin in recent months, battling a separate outbreak of a different disease \u2013 mpox \u2013 that has resulted in at least 2,031 cases, according to the WHO.",
      "Spokespeople for the State Department and USAID did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "President Trump has also ordered the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO, which was paired with a demand for all U.S. government staff to immediately sever collaboration with the U.N. agency that is helping to coordinate the response within the country.",
      "A U.S. health official said that CDC usually works closely with the WHO and a country's health authorities, often meeting daily to coordinate the response to outbreaks like this.",
      "Despite the president's order regarding WHO, \"CDC has been cleared to speak one-on-one with WHO counterparts related to response activities in Uganda,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement. The CDC said such conversations are also allowed regarding responses to other outbreaks of concern in Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "Attempts by U.S. agencies to deploy staff to aid the outbreak response have also been delayed, one official said, amid government-wide pauses to travel and spending.",
      "More than 100 staff are currently working in the CDC's office in Uganda, a U.S. official said. Agency staff are also currently embedded within Uganda's response team. An additional team of CDC experts is expected to deploy to the country this weekend, another health official said.",
      "While officials secured a waiver on Saturday from the State Department to free up some funds for the Ebola response, many recipients of U.S. funds have been reluctant to accept the money because of the turmoil in Washington, two people familiar with the situation said.",
      "Nonprofits have also been grappling with a growing number of demands imposed by the Trump administration as a condition for receiving funds, like a sweeping order to purge all mentions of gender and diversity \"at every level and activity, regardless of your location or the citizenship of employees or contractors\" supported by U.S. dollars.",
      "In Uganda, groups are still waiting for clarification from their in-country contacts at USAID about how the waiver would apply to their work, the people said, wary of incurring more expenses that might never be repaid.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's executive orders, the country's health ministry urged all staff backed by CDC and USAID to \"continue working in the spirit of patriotism as volunteers,\" in a letter obtained by CBS News, as Ugandan officials sought \"to restore normalcy.\"",
      "\"Radio silence\" from the CDC",
      "The growing outbreak in Uganda has also left some state and local health authorities befuddled with the \"radio silence\" from the CDC, officials told CBS News.",
      "In past outbreaks, CDC officials were quick to start ramping up preparedness for the possibility of cases spreading to the U.S.",
      "External meetings and information sharing that health authorities usually rely on to communicate with CDC officials were canceled amid the communications \"pause\" across the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS.",
      "An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The communications pause was initially expected to end this past weekend, but many federal health officials say they're still facing delays or denials in getting approval to publish information or participate in external meetings.",
      "\"HHS continues to increase staff levels as we look forward to the new Secretary leading the agency. HHS has approved numerous communications related to critical health and safety needs and will continue to do so,\" Andrew Nixon, the department's communications director, told CBS News in an earlier statement.",
      "As a stopgap, some states have been working on informal partnerships to ramp up their own preparedness for the arrival of potential cases, officials said.",
      "The CDC was able to publish a travel alert on Wednesday about travel to Uganda, but it left out links and information from the WHO's updates about the outbreak.",
      "Other donors stepping in",
      "Not all health experts are alarmed about the current situation.",
      "Two U.S. infectious disease physicians who have worked with outbreaks in the country expressed confidence that other groups and countries would be able to fill the void left by American support, but acknowledged they're concerned about the possibility of undetected spread and delays in the response.",
      "In past outbreaks of Ebola, the U.S. has often funded many of the key steps to contain the outbreak in its earliest days, including rushing to set up isolation facilities and support the outbreak response from an array of non-governmental organizations with workers in the country.",
      "U.S.-funded laboratories have usually been on the front lines of past responses to outbreaks, through institutions like the Uganda Virus Research Institute.",
      "Some groups, like M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and the WHO, have tried to cover the shortfall. The WHO recently touted its launch \u2014 with the help of Canada and Europe \u2014 of a vaccination trial in response to the outbreak.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 20:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The strain, called D1.1, was behind a human death from bird flu last year.",
    "story": [
      "At least four cattle herds in Nevada have tested positive for a strain of H5N1 bird flu never before seen in cows, state agriculture officials confirmed Wednesday, and respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing have been reported.",
      "That bird flu strain, called D1.1 by scientists, was also linked to a fatal human case in Louisiana last year after exposure to sick birds. The D1.1 strain has emerged in recent months to dominate infections in wild birds and poultry flocks across North America.",
      "Symptoms seen in humans infected by D1.1 have been more severe than the previous bird flu strain that has been spreading in cows. That strain, called B3.13, has led to only mild symptoms, like pink eye and fever, in humans infected after contact with sick cows.",
      "Research suggests that B3.13 is less likely to result in severe disease for humans, unlike other bird flu strains overseas. The risk is different for other animals, like pet cats, which have frequently died after exposure to food and milk contaminated with B3.13.",
      "The discovery of the D1.1 bird flu strain's spread in cows also upends previous theories floated by U.S. health and agriculture officials that the spillover of the virus into cows from wild birds was a rare, one-off event.",
      "All cases of bird flu in cows since a spillover in Texas in late 2023 had previously been linked only to B3.13, which officials have cited as evidence that new variants of the virus were not repeatedly spreading into cows from birds.",
      "\"The detection does not change USDA's HPAI eradication strategy,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said Wednesday, citing the federal government's plan to try to stop the unprecedented surge of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, in recent years.",
      "In addition to the human health threat posed by the virus, an unprecedented toll claimed by spillovers of the D1.1 from wild birds into chickens has driven up egg prices across the country.",
      "Nearly a thousand cow herds have been confirmed infected by bird flu to date, the USDA says, with detections across 16 states. Most recent cases have been in California.",
      "The four new cattle herds infected by D1.1 were reported in Nevada's Churchill County, a spokesperson for the state's Agriculture Department said.",
      "Bird flu was also reported in December from a herd in the state's Nye County, though those cows ended up testing positive for the B3.13 strain of the virus.",
      "The Nevada spokesperson said two additional herds in Churchill County have also now been placed under quarantine, pending laboratory results from the USDA.",
      "\"Symptoms of H5N1 D1.1 have been similar to the detections of B3.13. These include fever, reduced feed consumption, reduced milk production and mild respiratory signs (coughing, sneezing, runny nose),\" Ciara Ressel, Nevada Agriculture Department spokesperson, said of the cows' symptoms.",
      "Those herds were confirmed to have been infected as the result of a state investigation, the USDA said, after a silo that had received milk from the cows tested positive for the virus.",
      "\"USDA APHIS continues to work with the Nevada Department of Agriculture by conducting additional on-farm investigation, testing, and gathering additional epidemiological information to better understand this detection and limit further disease spread,\" the USDA said.",
      "It is unclear how many workers in the state may have been exposed to the D1.1 strain after working with those sick cows.",
      "A spokesperson for Nevada's health department referred a request to the Central Nevada Health District, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that 40 out of the 67 confirmed human bird flu cases since 2024 have been linked to exposure to dairy cows sick with the virus. Most of the others have been the result of exposure to infected poultry.",
      "In a news release last month, Nevada's Agriculture Department said the CDC \"maintains that the risk to humans remains low,\" and that it was \"working with state and county health officials to protect human health and safety.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment when asked if D1.1's spillover changes that risk assessment.",
      "\"It is critical that animal health biosecurity practices are enhanced to help prevent the spread of disease and protect animal and worker safety,\" state veterinarian Peter Rolfe said.",

      "Foodborne illness kills hundreds of Americans a year, sickens tens of millions annually, and costs billions in medical care, lost productivity and premature deaths, federal researchers said in a report.",
      "Roughly 10 million cases of foodborne illness each year in the U.S. are caused by six pathogens \u2014 salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens, shiga toxin-producing E. coli and norovirus, according to a coming study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The illnesses result in about 53,300 hospitalizations and more than 900 deaths annually, according to CDC estimates cited this week by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).",
      "The economic impact of these diseases is severe, costing an estimated $75 billion (in 2023 dollars) annually, including costs associated with secondary chronic illnesses and conditions that develop after the initial illness, according to the findings published Monday by the GAO, which also cited research by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.",
      "The actual count of people who get sick from eating food is unknown and likely far higher than official tallies, as only a small percentage of illnesses related to contaminated food is diagnosed and reported to public health officials. For every case of salmonella detected through a lab test, for example, 29 illnesses are caused by the bacteria, the CDC estimates.",
      "Last year, separate salmonella outbreaks linked to cucumbers and eggs sickened more than 200 people in dozens of states, while listeria outbreaks linked to ready-to-eat meat and poultry products sickened 19, hospitalized 17 and killed two. An outbreak of E. coli in the fall of 2024 linked to organic carrots sickened 48 people in 19 states, killing one. Another linked to onions served in McDonald's burgers sickened more than 100 people in 14 states, resulting in one death.",
      "At least 30 federal laws govern the safety and quality of the U.S. food supply, both domestic and imported, and 15 federal agencies administer the rules, making for a \"fragmented\" oversight system, according to the GAO, a federal agency charged with supplying nonpartisan information to Congress.

    "story": [
      "You know those Progressive Insurance commercials? Comedian Stephanie Courtney has played Flo the Insurance Woman in 215 ads, so far. She's helped turn Progressive into America's second-largest insurance company.",
      "She is, by any measure, one of the most successful actors in the world \u2013 on television nonstop for 16 years, with face recognition by the public, and the money that goes with it. \"I'm not gonna fight you on that!\" Courtney laughed. \"Even though in my head I'm like, What?\"",
      "I asked, \"What does it mean when you go out in public? Do people harass you? Want selfies?\"",
      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",
      "\"And so, that's the first clue about, like, who is she, how crazy can she get,\" she said.",
      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",
      "But if anyone knows about the ups and downs of showbiz, it's Deanna Colon. \"I am a 360-degree entertainer, singer, songwriter, vocal coach,\" she said. \"If you want to be in the world of entertainment, you have to do it all.\"",
      "Colon was on \"America's Got Talent,\" and she's appeared in ads for Pepsi and Big Lots. But the biggest break she ever got was the Jardiance commercial.",
      "\"I have Type 2 diabetes, but I manage it well, it's a little pill with a big story to tell!\"",
      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dean Winters will be Mayhem for as long as Allstate will have him. \"You know, I really hope that I'm doing it until Mayhem is wheelchair racing in a nursing home, you know what I mean?\" he laughed.",
      "As for Stephanie Courtney, she's given up her youthful dreams of appearing on Broadway or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But she still performs every week with The Groundlings improv group.",
      "And she still loves being Flo. \"I will tell you, the thing that made my heart grow three sizes that day was the Halloween costumes, seeing, especially like little kids, I love it so much,\" she said.",

      "Additional tickets were still free to purchase from the online marketplaces that advertise original event passes from Super Bowl organizers as well as resale tickets. The affordable ones, relative to floor seating, were generally scattered along the terrace, with prices ranging from that $2,920 low to nearly $5,000 depending on the seller and their location.",

It's the Patriots against Falcons in Super Bowl LI \u2026 the Red Sox against the Yankees \u2026 the Heat against the Spurs \u2026 and every damn sports movie ever made.

      "On the eve of Super Bowl 59, the\u00a0Philadelphia Eagles\u00a0and\u00a0Kansas City Chiefs\u00a0aren't the only ones dreaming of touchdowns. Brands and advertisers with millions riding on the success of commercials to be aired during the 2025 Super Bowl broadcast are also hoping to score. Here's a look at how much money goes into Super Bowl ads, and why advertisers say the high-cost commercials are worth it.",
      "How much do Super Bowl commercials cost on average for 2025?",
      "Advertisers are shelling out close to $8 million on average for a 30-second spot during Super Bowl LIX, Peter Bray, founder and executive creative director at ad agency Bray & Co., told CBS MoneyWatch. He estimates that around 51 minutes of advertising has been sold for the approximately three to four hour broadcast this year, making the total amount of ad sales somewhere in the hundreds of millions.",
      "Want to watch Super Bowl 2025 commercials early? These ads are already live.",
      "Want to watch Super Bowl 2025 commercials early? These ads are already live.",
      "The close to $8 million price tag is almost a million dollars more than the $7 million it cost for a 30-second spot in Super Bowl 2024. Commercial air time during the NFL Championship in 2023 was also about $7 million for 30 seconds, a 55% jump from 2019. Super Bowl advertising costs are \"creeping up,\" said Bray, who believes ad sales for the broadcast will soon reach $1 billion.",
      "\"I think in three years it's going to hit a billion dollars in ad sales. And that has never before happened on the planet. That is the immensity of this event,\" he said.",
      "Why are Super Bowl ads so expensive?",
      "\"It's the advertising industry's Super Bowl as well,\" Bray said. \"It's the one time of year where the general public actually cares about advertising so it's an exciting time.\"",
      "And social media, he says, has only made the broadcast more important.",
      "\"It's actually made advertising in the Super Bowl more relevant than ever because what's happened is with all these different platforms, it's very difficult to find a large audience at once,\" Bray said. \"Someone might advertise as an advertiser on TikTok, or on Instagram ... all of these different advertising opportunities. But you might be duplicating because the audience on TikTok, maybe 90% are the same audience on Instagram, so there's a lot of duplication.\"",
      "More than 120 million people are expected to watch Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, which will be broadcast on Fox and\u00a0livestreamed for free\u00a0on Tubi. To keep those viewers transfixed, brands will try to use humor, emotion or a famous actor to create a cultural moment that a mass audience can engage with collectively.",
      "\"Comedy can be a safe route for brands, and you don't want to divide your audience at all, so comedy makes sense. There's more celebrities being used than ever,\" Bray said.",
      "Depending on a celebrity's level of fame, they can add anywhere from less than $50,000 for a brief cameo to millions of dollars. Bray said he estimates the tab for most stars that appear in a Super Bowl spot to be in the $2 million range.",

      "Dunkin' first featured Affleck \u2014 a Boston native and actual Dunkin' donuts fan \u2014 in its inaugural Super Bowl ad in 2023. The 30-second spot, which included a cameo of his then wife, Jennifer Lopez, garnered 7 billion impressions for the company after its first airing, according to Dunkin' President Scott Murphy in a 2024 interview with Entreprenuer magazine. The ad was produced by\u00a0 Artists Equity, a company founded by Affleck and Matt Damon in 2022.",
      "A multipart campaign followed,\u00a0including\u00a0a promotion featuring Gen Z rapper Ice Spice. The storyline culminated with Dunkin's 2024 Super Bowl ad, a comedic 60-second spot that introduces the characters The DunKings, an aspirational rap group Affleck forms with Matt Damon and Tom Brady, dressed in bright orange and pink track suits.",
      "One year and many\u00a0sold-out track suits later, Dunkin' and Affleck return for their third Super Bowl ad collaboration, which\u00a0features\u00a0Casey Affleck and \"Succession\" star Jeremy Strong.",
      "\"Ben Affleck is a great combination with Dunkin',\" said Bray, \"Not because of him as an actor or director, but how he's perceived in popular culture. \"Jeremy Strong from 'Succession,' he's a kooky guy, but he's known as a method actor. Dunkin' know this ... they're connecting who these celebrities are as people rather than actors to the brands. And that makes for a really powerful ad.\"",
      "How much did Super Bowl commercials cost in past years?",

Two networks aired the game, with a 30-second spot costing $37,500 on NBC and $42,500 on CBS, according to a timeline of ad prices listed on SportingNews.com.

      "States that currently have NEVI-funded projects up and running mostly have been reimbursed by the federal government. But the new memo means states with projects in the works, or those currently contracting for them, are to be halted immediately, and they don't know if or when they will be able to proceed and request reimbursement.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's list of tax priorities includes eliminating a loophole that benefits private equity firms, hedge funds and other big investors.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is proposing to eliminate a tax loophole that's also a long-time target of some Democratic lawmakers.",
      "Mr. Trump is working on \"no tax on seniors' Social Security, no tax on overtime pay\" as well as renewing the tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Jan. 6. But, she added, the president also wants to abolish the \"carried interest tax deduction loophole.\"",
      "The latter tax break might not be well-known to many Americans given that it's predominantly used by hedge funds, private equity firms and other types of investment funds. That loophole allows investment managers to greatly lower their taxable income, a major perk for investors whose annual earnings can mount into the billions.",
      "Carried interest refers to the income that investment managers collect from their funds, which is typically 20% of profits. Under current tax law, that income is taxed as a capital gain, which has a top tax rate of 20% for long-term gains, versus the highest rate of 37% for regular income, such as the money that workers receive in their paychecks.",
      "\"The carried interest tax loophole is one of the clearest examples of our two-tiered tax system,\" said David Kass, executive director of the tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Average Americans can't cut their tax burden in half for no reason, but the wealthy and well-connected can.\"",
      "Aligned with Democrats",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal to remove the carried interest deduction aligns him with the aims of Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have long sought to eliminate the loophole. Most recently, Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, and 13 other lawmakers on Thursday\u00a0introduced the Carried Interest Fairness Act, which would boost the tax rate on investment funds' carried interest to the same rates paid by workers on their income.",
      "Eliminating the Wall Street tax break could help boost tax revenue by about $100 billion over the next decade, according to a new analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), an advocacy group focused on fiscal matters. That would only partly offset the wide-ranging tax cuts Mr. Trump is proposing, which the CRFB estimates will cost almost $5 trillion over the next 10 years.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal is getting pushback from Wall Street, with the trade group American Investment Council urging the new administration to preserve the tax break.",
      "\"We encourage the Trump Administration and Congress to keep this sound tax policy in place and unleash more long-term investment that supports jobs, workers, small businesses, and local communities,\" said Drew Maloney, CEO of the American Investment Council, in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The private equity industry has invested more than $5.6 trillion in the U.S. economy since Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, Maloney noted.",
      "Ending the loophole would put investment managers on the same tax footing as middle-class workers, Kass of the Americans for Tax Fairness said",

      "The average $25,000 price of a car imported from Mexico or Canada could jump $6,250 if the tariffs take effect, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility. The automotive research firm forecasts that importers would likely pass most of any increase in their costs along to consumers.",
      "What are tariffs? Here's everything you need to know about the import duties.",
      "What are tariffs? Here's everything you need to know about the import duties.",
      "\"The automotive industry is at a critical juncture,\" Michael Robinet, vice president of forecasting at S&P Global Mobility said in a statement. \"The proposed tariffs could not only inflate vehicle prices but also disrupt production schedules, with estimates suggesting a potential 30% decrease in production for high-exposure vehicles once tariffs are enacted, even if only for the short-term.\"",
      "After President Trump on Feb. 1 signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tax on Chinese goods, the White House on Monday suspended those plans for the U.S.' North American neighbors for at least a month to conduct negotiations.",
      "Whether those talks will yield a breakthrough is uncertain. But in response to pressure from Mr. Trump. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have pledged to step up efforts to combat the flow of illicit drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration sees tariffs as a way to exact better terms with U.S. trading partners as well as to leverage other policy gains. In a Feb. 2 post on social media, Mr. Trump acknowledged a new wave of tariffs could cause\u00a0\"some pain\" for Americans, but said his broader vision for the country \"will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "Impact on automakers",
      "While the 25% levies\u00a0on Canada and Mexico have been paused, auto manufacturers are bracing for impact.",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on Wednesday, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said the company is positioned to manage \"a few weeks of tariffs.\" But a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth, he said.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Farley said Ford has enough inventory, including parts, to endure a couple of weeks of tariffs without having to ship car components across the U.S.'s southern and northern borders. Over the long-term, however, the company would have to \"make some major strategy shifts,\" he said, including building new plants in the U.S. to circumvent the taxes.",
      "Mr. Trump has said higher tariffs would spur both U.S. and foreign companies to create more jobs in the U.S. Most economists express skepticism that a higher tariff regime would lead to such a boom, saying most costs would trickle down to American consumers.",
      "General Motors CEO Mary Barra last week also alluded to the effects tariffs could have on its business, saying the company is considering restructuring its supply chain to cushion the blow from tariffs.",
      "\"We're doing the planning and have several levers that we can pull,\" Barra said in an earnings call.",
      "Aptiv, which makes car parts, including vehicle software, hardware and electrical/electronic architecture, has also recently cautioned that potential tariffs could hurt its supply chain.",
      "\"Very intertwined\" economies",
      "Roughly 3.6 million light vehicles were imported into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico in 2024, accounting for 22% of all car sales nationwide, according to S&P Global Mobility. Mexico is the largest source of U.S. light vehicle imports, representing about 15% of sales.",
      "\"The tariffs would really hit the automobile industry hard because the motor vehicle industries of the U.S., Mexico and Canada are very intertwined,\" Marcus Noland, trade policy expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Parts will cross the border seven to eight times before final assembly, and the tariffs are applied every time a part crosses \u2014 so costs would go up very quickly.\"",
      "Manufacturers could reshore some production to the U.S. to avoid the levies, he said, but that would take time and require investing in new manufacturing facilities and labor.",
      "\"The amount of disruption this would cause cannot be overstated,\" Nolan said, adding that the tariffs would also \"tank\" the Mexican economy given how dependent it is on automobile exports to the U.S.",
      "\"If they start going belly up, you'll have unemployed people along the U.S. border, and the ironic thing is one of the reasons for this action was illegal migration, and it could actually incentivize illegal migration. By damaging the Mexican economy, you would probably increase the levels of illegal migration,\" he added.",
      "Reshoring challenges",
      "Automakers are mulling actions to offset possible cost increases, according to manufacturing executives and supply chain experts. But ramping up domestic production presents major challenges, analysts note.",
      "Reshoring production would drive up manufacturing costs due to higher labor expenses, and could contribute to an existing labor shortage, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Duncan Angove, CEO of digital supply-chain company Blue Yonder, told CBS MoneyWatch he expects U.S. automakers to double down on investing in automation and artificial intelligence to cut down on production costs, noting that the tariffs will either reduce companies' profit margins or result in higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Even before, there was a lot of investment pouring into new technology and automation,\" he said. \"But because they realize they can't pass the whole tariff increase along to the consumer, they are making these investments to reduce costs.\"",
      "Meanwhile, if new car prices rise, more U.S. consumers would likely turn to the used car market, which would drive up prices of second-hand vehicles, he added.",
      "\"Bonanza\" for foreign competitors",
      "On Ford's earnings call Wednesday, Farley said U.S. tariffs on Canada and Mexico would not only hurt American automakers, but also benefit foreign competitors not subject to higher import duties, such as Korea's Hyundai and Japan's Honda and Toyota.",
      "\"If we're going to have a tariff policy that lasts for a month or whatever it's going to be, years, it better be comprehensive for our industry,\" Farley said. \"We can't just cherry-pick one place or the other, because this is a bonanza for our import competitors.\"",
      "Tom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told CBS MoneyWatch that prolonged tariffs would result in the U.S. \"hurting American companies and helping Korean and Japanese companies.\"",
      "Meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba in the Oval Office Friday, however, Mr. Trump said tariffs on Japan remain on the table if the U.S.' trade imbalance with Tokyo isn't reduced.",
      "\"We're going to work that out, I think very quickly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't think it will be any problem,\" he said. \"They want fairness also.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump said Friday that Japan's Nippon Steel will drop its $14.1 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel and instead \"invest heavily\" in the company.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Friday that Japan's Nippon Steel will drop its $14.1 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel and instead \"invest heavily\" in the company without taking a majority stake.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the development in a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House.",
      "\"[Nippon's] going to be doing something very exciting about U.S. Steel. They'll be looking at an investment rather than a purchase,\" he said. \"U.S. Steel is a very important company to us. It was the greatest company in the world for 15 years, many years ago, 80 years ago. And we didn't want to see that leave. And it wouldn't actually leave. But the concept, psychologically, not good. So they've agreed to invest heavily in U.S. Steel as opposed to own it, and that sounds very exciting.\"",
      "The president did not reveal details of the proposed investment, and said he and other officials will meet next week with the head of Nippon, which Mr. Trump mistakenly referred to as \"Nissan\" several times. \"They'll work out the details. I'll be there to mediate and arbitrate,\" he said.",
      "People close to the deal were uncertain about whether Mr. Trump wants them to restructure the deal or start again from scratch. And it remains unclear how the president's remarks might affect the proposed acquisition.",
      "Earlier in the day, sources told CBS News that Mr. Trump was considering reversing his disapproval of the merger, which he expressed in a December post on Truth Social: \"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan.\"",
      "During his Oval Office meeting with Ishiba on Friday, CBS News asked the president whether he had changed his mind about the sale. He hinted that he would have news to share afterward and said he thought it would be discussed, saying he hadn't changed his mind. However, he added, \"I hear we'll have some pretty good information on that.\"",
      "Last month, Nippon proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a review panel known as CFIUS. That change was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "The proposed change in the so-called mitigation agreement would give all of the decision-making power on changes to production capacity to the U.S. government.",
      "On Monday, Nippon and U.S. Steel submitted a 70-page opening brief in their case against the U.S. alleging that former President Joe Biden blocked the merger for political reasons and violated their due process. The suit has continued during the Trump administration.",
      "The two companies said in a joint statement announcing the lawsuit last month that they had \"engaged in good faith with all parties to underscore how the transaction will enhance, not threaten, United States national security.\"",
      "A second lawsuit aimed at domestic rival Cleveland-Cliffs' CEO Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers President David McCall was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the companies stated.",
      "Biden moved to halt the acquisition after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it, saying that maintaining a strong domestic steel industry was important for U.S. national security.",

      "Employers around the U.S. added 143,000 jobs in January, as the labor market showed signs of cooling at the start of 2025.",
      "The numbers",
      "Hiring was weaker than expected by economists, who had forecast that the economy had added 170,000 jobs last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the nation's unemployment rate edged down to 4%, versus 4.1% in December.",
      "The unemployment rate had been forecast to remain at 4.1% in January, according to FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "The January employment figures show a slowdown in hiring from December, when employers added 307,000 new jobs. Still, the 143,000 new jobs in January are not far off from the average monthly gain of 166,000 in 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Employers in the health care, retail and social assistance industries added new hires last month, although employment declined in mining, quarrying and the oil and gas extraction industries, the BLS said on Friday.",
      "Although the latest data indicates the labor market remains solid \u2014 albeit growing at a slower pace than in December \u2014 it also means borrowing costs for consumers and businesses are likely to stay higher longer. The Federal Reserve wants to see more progress on getting inflation down to its goal of a 2% annual rate before it makes additional rate cuts.",
      "At its January meeting, the Federal Reserve held its benchmark rate unchanged, hitting the pause button on a series of rate cuts it started last fall.",

      "Still, the overall job market remains on firm\u00a0ground, with the nation's unemployment rate falling in January. Between November and December, monthly job gains also averaged 237,000, above their six-month average of 178,000, according to Deutsche Bank.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 14:55:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency wants to cut government spending, but it's also prompting lawsuits and concerns about data privacy.",
    "story": [
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, was created by President Trump on Jan. 20 with a mission to slash federal spending. Since then, the task force led by billionaire Elon Musk says it has saved more than $1 billion by canceling diversity, equity and inclusion contracts, among other expenses, according to DOGE's social media account.",
      "But since kicking into gear on Jan. 20, DOGE has also prompted several lawsuits and raised alarms from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "Supporters of DOGE see its efforts as a way to rein in bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outpacing its tax revenue, causing the federal debt to spiral to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. Mr. Trump has said he wants to cut programs that don't align with his policies and to slash the federal workforce.",
      "\"@DOGE is trying to STOP your tax dollars from being stolen for WASTE and FRAUD,\" Musk posted on X, his social media app, on Feb. 4.",
      "Critics of the task force say that Musk, who runs companies including SpaceX that receive billions in government contracts, could be engaged in work through DOGE that may pose conflicts of interest with his private businesses, such as potentially gaining access to data about competitors' federal contracts.",
      "A Feb. 3 lawsuit filed by two unions and an advocacy group for older Americans alleges that the Treasury Department has unlawfully provided Musk and DOGE with the private personal data of most U.S. taxpayers.",
      "Here's what to know about DOGE's operations and its role within the Trump administration.",
      "What is DOGE?",
      "The acronym DOGE is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke in 2021 by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin, whose price can be volatile, has shed about one-third of its value since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.)",
      "When Mr. Trump launched DOGE through an executive order last month, he housed it within the executive branch, rather than creating it as an outside advisory committee. The order said that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on government technology projects and that exists within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \u2014 would be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "The executive order also noted that a DOGE team of at least four employees, which could include special government employees, would be assigned to each agency, such as the Department of Labor or the Treasury Department. Those groups were to each include one team leader, one engineer, one human resources specialist and one attorney.",
      "Those teams are tasked with \"a software modernization initiative to improve the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, network infrastructure, and information technology (IT) systems,\" according to Mr. Trump's order. The teams would also to advise the agencies \"on implementing the President's DOGE Agenda,\" the executive order states.",
      "Setting DOGE up within an existing tech-focused unit within OMB is \"quite interesting,\" said Robert Burton, a former OMB official who spoke recently at a webinar about DOGE hosted by George Mason University.",
      "\"This works perfectly for DOGE's services \u2014 it's really the same type of mission, bringing in these really smart people from the private sector\" to work on government tech, Burton said.",
      "Is Elon Musk a government employee?",
      "Musk is classified as a \"special government employee,\" Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone \"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role, created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, can be either paid or unpaid. Because Musk \u2014 who is ranked as the world's wealthiest person, with a fortune Bloomberg estimates at more than $400 billion \u2014 is not paid for his work as an SGE, he doesn't need to file a public financial disclosure report.",
      "What has DOGE done so far?",
      "According to social media posts from DOGE and Musk, the task force is seeking to identify federal contracts and spending on issues that don't align with Mr. Trump's policies, including DEI and foreign aid.",
      "\"DOGE has now saved taxpayers over $1 billion in crazy DEI contracts,\" Musk wrote on Jan. 30.",
      "Musk wrote in a November opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that he and his then DOGE co-partner Vivek Ramaswamy aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal spending. That would represent about 7% of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual expenditures.",
      "Experts warn that deep spending cuts could prove problematic, given that about two-thirds of government spending is directed toward Social Security, Medicare, national defense and Medicaid. While on the campaign trail before the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare, which provide retirement and health benefits for millions of senior citizens.",
      "What is DOGE doing at the Treasury?",
      "DOGE recently sparked an outcry from some taxpayers, Democratic lawmakers and government watchdogs after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which is handled by a little-known unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "The Bureau of the Fiscal Service disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks, tax refunds and federal salaries. In pointing to some ways it is saving taxpayer money, DOGE has said in social media\u00a0posts that it has nixed DEI contracts at the Treasury, as well as canceled the agency's subscriptions to the New York Times.",
      "DOGE's access to sensitive financial data has raised concerns about the potential for errors, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, writing in a Feb. 2 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that providing DOGE with access to the systems is \"risking missteps that could result in a global financial meltdown that costs trillions of dollars and millions of jobs.\"",
      "Others have flagged data security risks tied to DOGE's access to taxpayers' personal information, such as bank account data and Social Security numbers.",
      "\"The scale of the intrusion into individuals' privacy is massive and unprecedented,\" the Feb. 3 lawsuit from the unions claimed. \"Secretary Bessent's action granting DOGE-affiliated individuals full, continuous and ongoing access to that information for an unspecified period of time means that retirees, taxpayers, federal employees, companies and other individuals from all walks of life have no assurance that their information will receive the protection that federal law affords.\"",
      "Musk \"has abided by all federal laws,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "What is DOGE doing with USAID?",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have also taken aim at the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, upending an organization that\u00a0provides humanitarian aid\u00a0to more than 100 countries.",
      "Both men contend that much of the 60-year-old agency's spending is wasteful. Supporters of the agency say USAID is essential for national security, countering influence from U.S. rivals, while also providing critical humanitarian assistance across the globe.",
      "Officials working with DOGE sought access to the Treasury's payment system to stop money from flowing to USAID, the Associated Press reported, citing to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "In a Feb. 4 letter to lawmakers, Treasury officials said DOGE's technical capacity is limited to viewing payments data, while federal expenditures have not been affected.",
      "What is DOGE doing with Social Security?",
      "DOGE said in a Feb. 5 post on social media that the Social Security Administration had \"terminated its contract for the 'Gender X initiative marker' and removed all references to gender ideology from public facing applications.\" The task force said the effort would save about $1 million.",
      "A potentially larger issue is DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment system because it processes the Social Security payments for more than 70 million people and contains the Social Security numbers of most Americans.",
      "Musk and his team \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, said on Feb. 3.",
      "The Treasury says DOGE has been given \"read only\" access to its payment system.",
      "A federal judge on Feb. 7 also was scheduled to consider whether to block DOGE from accessing computer systems at the Labor Department. A group of labor unions has filed suit to deny DOGE employees entry to those systems, which the plaintiffs allege contain sensitive information about federal employees, including which workers has investigated Musk's companies.",
      "The Labor Department also has confidential information about companies that compete with Musk's enterprises, including SpaceX and Tesla, the suit claims. The Justice Department said there's no proof of wrongdoing and that the judge shouldn't issue sweeping\u00a0order \"based on plaintiffs' rank speculation that DOL will violate the law.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 18:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal court temporarily paused the Trump administration's \"deferred resignation\" offer, while unions claim it is against the law.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of federal workers have more time to ponder their next career move after a judge on Thursday temporarily suspended the Office of Personnel Management's deadline for them to accept or reject the agency's\u00a0\"deferred resignation\" offer.",
      "The cutoff to take the deal had been set to expire on Thursday at midnight Eastern time before the ruling from U.S. District Judge George O'Toole barred the OPM from implementing the deadline. A Justice Department lawyer said the agency, which sent the original offer, would notify government employees that the deadline is paused pending further legal proceedings.",
      "\"In compliance with the court order, the deadline for federal employees to accept the deferred resignation program is being extended to Monday, Feb. 10, at 11:59 p.m. EST,\" the OPM said in a social media post. \"The program is NOT being blocked or canceled. The government will honor the deferred resignation offer.\"",
      "Under the OPM's offer, employees who accepted it would continue getting paid through September but would be excused from reporting for workers. But if they opted to keep their jobs, they could get fired.",
      "That decision, one affecting the careers and livelihoods of 2.3 million civilian federal employees, is a fraught one, employment attorneys and government watchdogs said. In part, that's because the offer includes a number of provisions that are unclear and not guaranteed, posing financial and professional risks while leaving workers in danger of not getting what they signed up for, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Trump administration also may lack authority to extend such a deal, and as such the deferred resignation allegedly breaks numerous laws, a Feb. 4 lawsuit filed by several federal employee unions alleges. The plaintiffs in that suit are asking a court to block the government's offer, which they describe as \"arbitrary, capricious\" and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, a 1946 law governing how federal agencies implement regulations.",
      "The deferred resignation offer is the brainchild of the second Trump administration, which has ordered federal workers to return to the office five days a week\u00a0while directing government agencies to end remote work arrangements. The White House expects to persuade up to roughly 10% of the federal civilian workforce to resign, saving $100 billion a year in costs.",
      "The offer isn't available to members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security,\u00a0according\u00a0to the OPM.",
      "Through Feb. 5, about 40,000 federal workers had accepted the deal, or some 2% of the federal workforce, according to a CBS News source familiar with the matter.",
      "\"We encourage federal workers in this city to accept the very generous offer,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Thursday around the time of Judge O'Toole's ruling. \"They don't want to come into the office. If they want to rip the American people off, then they're welcome to take this buyout and we'll find highly qualified people\" to replace them.",
      "Risks to workers",
      "OPM's offer includes many gray areas that could present pitfalls to employees who accept it, legal sources and union officials said.",
      "\"There is a risk for employees to take this without knowing what would happen down the line,\" said Ryan Nerney, managing partner at law firm Tully Rinckey and an expert on federal employment law. \"If you decide to take this, and let's say there's a reduction in force and your job is eliminated, there is no guidance on what would happen in a circumstance like that. Would you still get paid through Sept. 30?\"",
      "The agency's email lacks specifics and guarantees about the offer, adding to government workers' confusion, Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very confusing \u2014 it says you won't have to do your position duties anymore, but there is a caveat that says if they need you, you have to keep doing that,\" Greenwald said, referring to the resignation letter that says employees aren't expected to work except in \"rare circumstances.\"",
      "A dozen state attorneys general around the country have also cautioned federal workers about accepting the offer, describing it as \"misleading\" and urging employees to closely scrutinize the terms.",
      "Elon Musk's \"Fork in the Road\"",
      "Federal workers received the Trump administration's offer in an email last month entitled \"A Fork in the Road,\" mirroring the subject line of a 2022 message\u00a0sent by billionaire Elon Musk to employees at Twitter, the social media platform he bought in October 2022 and later renamed X.",
      "Like Twitter's earlier deal, OPM's offer includes a demand that federal workers make a decision by a specific date. In his 2022 email, Musk told Twitter employees they had one day to decide to either agree to work in a \"hardcore\" style or quit and get three months of severance.",
      "Musk is spearheading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force tasked by President Trump with slashing federal costs. The Tesla CEO has touted the government's deferred resignation offer on X, claiming that employees who accept it can do \"whatever you like, including obtaining a new job\" while receiving government pay and benefits through September.",
      "Although that could strike some workers like a good deal, the unions' lawsuit claims OPM may not have the financial authority to make that offer. For instance, the agency's email states it will pay workers who agree to resign by Feb. 6 through Sept. 30, but funding for most federal agencies expires on March 14.",
      "That indicates the Trump administration is planning to spend money \"before an appropriation is authorized,\" the suit claims. If so, that could violate The Antideficiency Act, a law that prohibits federal agencies from spending above their appropriated levels, the complaint alleges.",
      "The deferred resignation offer allegedly also violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the lawsuit claims. That law says courts can find government agency actions to be unlawful if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"",
      "It's also not clear what could happen to federal workers who accept the offer if it is then found to be illegal by the courts, said Robert Weissman, co-president of government watchdog group Public Citizen. \"I could imagine going back to work and being told you did not work, and we're not going to pay you for an illegal program,\" he said.",
      "Government employees should \"be skeptical about what is actually going to be delivered through this offer,\" Weissman added.",
      "Impact on federal services?",
      "The offer also fails to consider the impact of widespread resignations on the government's ability to provide services to Americans, the union suit alleges. Twitter (now X) suffered from a number of issues after Musk cut the majority of its workforce, including a decline in advertisers and sharp drop in its valuation, the complaint states.",
      "A sweeping job-cutting measure could cause chaos if government agencies lacked enough staff to handle some services such as tax refund processing, Social Security verification, or providing health care through Medicaid and Medicare, experts say.",
      "\"There is no 10% across-the-board slush fund of employees that [the public] would not feel any harm by this,\" Greenwald said. \"The federal government is not Twitter \u2014 it is funded by Congress and budgeted by that process, and it is set to uphold the laws that Congress has passed.\"",
      "Federal employee unions are also chafing at the OPM's nine-day window for workers to make a decision, with the lawsuit calling it \"an arbitrary date ... selected to put maximum pressure on the federal workforce so that they would accept the offer, in many cases contrary to federal agency and federal employee interests.\"",
      "Giving federal employees just over a week to make a weighty career decision is a departure from previous voluntary resignation offers, with buyouts in the Clinton administration providing one year for workers to accept a deal, the lawsuit points out.",
      "Still, despite the unknowns in OPM's offer, it might make sense for some government workers, such as people who were already planning to retire soon, Nerney said.",

      "About 500,000 ranges sold nationwide are being recalled after dozens of fires burned property, people and pets, LG Electronics said Wednesday in a notice posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The recall involves ranges with front-mounted knobs that can be turned accidentally, with CPSC receiving at least 86 reports of unintentional activation. The recalled ranges have been involved in more than 28 fires, with at least five causing extensive property damage totaling more than $340,000. At least eight minor injuries have been reported, including burns, and at least three of the fires involved the deaths of pets, according to the federal agency.",
      "Found at appliance stores including Best Buy, Costco, The Home Depot, Lowe's, and online at LG.com, the recalled ranges were sold from 2015 through January 2025 for between $1,400 and $2,650, depending on the model.

    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk is categorized as a \"special government employee\" through his work with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a cost-cutting initiative created by President Trump to find ways to trim federal spending.",
      "Musk's employee status was confirmed by White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt on Monday, although she added that she wasn't sure whether the Tesla CEO has gained security clearance.",
      "DOGE, which isn't a federal department, has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and sparked several lawsuits since Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, with some claiming Musk's DOGE is violating various laws. For instance, two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy group for older people and retirees, sued on Feb. 3 over DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment systems \u2014 which handle everything from tax refunds to Social Security payments \u2014 alleging that the move breaches privacy regulations.",
      "That lawsuit pointed out that, at the time of its filing, Musk's status with the federal government was unclear.",

      "Here's what to know about the \"special government employee\" designation.",

      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone who\"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\" according to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role was created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, according to the publication Government Executive. A special government employee can be paid or unpaid, the Justice Department notes.",
      "Which rules must SGEs adhere to?",
      "SGEs \"are subject to most rules, although sometimes in a less restrictive way,\" including ethics and conflict of interest rules, the Justice Department states.",
      "But SGEs also are prohibited from working on issues that impact their financial interests, as well as their spouses, children or organizations in which they work or serve as a director or trustee. Some of Musk's businesses rely on the federal government's contracts, including SpaceX, which was awarded 100 contracts in 2023 worth $3 billion, according to the New York Times.",
      "Musk's potential conflict of interests were highlighted by Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, in a Jan. 31 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the Tesla CEO's access to the department's payment system.",
      "\"I am concerned Musk's enormous business operations in China \u2014 a country whose intelligence agencies have stolen vast amounts of sensitive data about Americans, including U.S. government employee data by hacking U.S. government systems \u2014 endangers U.S. cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make his access to these systems a national security risk,\" Wyden wrote.",
      "However, an SGE can get a waiver \"if your interest is not large,\" the Justice Department notes. \"If you do not qualify for a waiver, you will have to disqualify yourself from participating in any matter that affects your financial interests.\"",
      "Musk's $418 billion fortune is largely tied up in his stakes in SpaceX, worth $136 billion, and Tesla, valued at $158 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Does Musk need to make disclosures as an SGE?",
      "Special government employees are only required to make a public financial disclosure report if they earn above the GS-15 government pay rate, or about $123,000. If they make below that, they can file on a confidential basis.",
      "It's not clear whether Musk is being paid for his work or if he's participating on a volunteer basis, although DOGE has recruited full-time salaried employees.",

      "The de minimis exemption helped the Chinese e-commerce giants keep their costs low, and appeal to predominately young American consumers with contemporary styles at incredibly low prices. The companies ship directly to consumers, allowing them to compete with domestic players including Amazon, which launched its own answer to Temu and Shein last year, called Amazon Haul.

    "summary": "Even next-door neighbors face starkly contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery, as nation's home insurance crisis grows.",
    "story": [
      "Before a wildfire ravaged their street in northwest Altadena, Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson lived next door to each other in nearly identical houses.",
      "\"I chose an old home in an old neighborhood because it has soul,\" said Hamlin, a 51-year-old single mom with a teenage boy, who bought her 1,500-square-foot home 10 years ago.",
      "Today, gone are their charming English-style cottages built in 1925 with the welcoming porches and Palladian windows. Amid the rubble and ash, little is left of their historic neighborhood.",
      "In the weeks since the Eaton wildfire took their homes, Hamlin and Wilson have been stumbling through the layers of business, bureaucracy and emotional trauma of surviving a natural disaster, with their sights firmly set on rebuilding.",
      "How they'll navigate rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery that reveals the nation's growing home insurance crisis. Her insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "\"It changes the whole trajectory to your life,\" said Wilson, 44, who bought his house five years ago with his wife, who is six months pregnant with their first child.",
      "Hamlin's home was privately covered by Mercury Insurance, but Wilson was forced onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state's bare-bones insurance program \u2014 when SafeCo declined to renew his policy last May. The FAIR Plan insures people who can't get private coverage but need insurance as a condition of their mortgage.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, many property owners find themselves struggling to find or afford private insurance. The issue is particularly acute in California, where some major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies altogether or are refusing to renew existing ones.",
      "State officials recently started rolling out new regulations to entice insurers to stay in California, with the hope of getting as many homeowners as possible off the FAIR Plan.",
      "FAIR, with its high premiums and basic coverage, was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders find a more permanent option. Yet the number of FAIR Plan residential policies more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies last year.",
      "For Wilson and Hamlin, their parallel rebuilding journeys serve as a cautionary tale. Wilson paid nearly 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, for less than half the coverage.",
      "\"That's why a lot of people call it 'The Unfair Plan.'\" said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.",
      "SafeCo's parent company Liberty Mutual said in a statement that it couldn't comment on any individual policies but acknowledged \"difficult but purposeful business decisions\" in California.",
      "Mercury didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurance companies, said California is fortunate to have the FAIR Plan, which is required to accept everyone. Ruiz said outcomes would be even worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said California is working to make sure all claims are paid. He said in a statement that his office is working to get homeowners off the FAIR Plan and back to traditional more comprehensive insurance coverage.",
      "A FAIR Plan spokesperson declined to comment on Wilson's case, and noted that it's difficult to compare policies and coverage.",
      "Thousands of people lost their homes in the Eaton and nearby Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
      "The FAIR Plan said it expanded staffing to meet the surging demand and has a funding mechanism in place to pay all covered claims. State data shows more than 31,000 wildfire-related claims had been filed as of last week, including roughly 4,400 claims under the FAIR Plan.",
      "Hamlin had standard comprehensive home insurance, with an annual policy premium of $1,264 at the time of the fire. She can receive up to $1.5 million to replace her home, other structures and personal property, including up to $303,000 for living expenses while displaced. Her policy further entitles her to coverage that could add more than $200,000 to help her rebuild.",
      "Wilson, meanwhile, pays a $2,000 premium for the FAIR Plan that sets his maximum payout at $686,000, including $100,000 for living expenses while displaced.",
      "Wilson also had to buy \"wrap-around insurance\" for $1,500 a year for issues the FAIR Plan doesn't cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects. That supplemental plan doesn't cover fire damage.",
      "Hamlin said Mercury's support has been exceptional, immediately sending her money and helping with next steps such as finding housing and getting contractor quotes. Within days, the company wired her tens of thousands of dollars to get started while the process fell into place.",
      "\"Being able to rest at night and wake up and deal with everything else is really important,\" Hamlin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled to even talk to a FAIR Plan representative. There was zero communication in the first two weeks, contact information was listed incorrectly, phone numbers had no voicemail and emails bounced back.",
      "\"Half the time, I feel like I'm doing something wrong,\" Wilson said.",
      "After The Associated Press reached out for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller said a representative would contact Wilson directly.",
      "Wilson said he feels haunted by his choices. He thought he had bought property in a low-risk area, and had avoided looking for homes in another neighborhood further north after hearing that people there had been dropped by their insurers.",
      "Hamlin, too, was aware of the fire risks when she moved in. She previously lived in Pasadena and was surprised that State Farm, her then-insurance company, would not offer her coverage in Altadena. She chose Mercury because it was the cheapest option, and was considering pursuing even more robust coverage.",
      "\"I could have been dropped when Chris was dropped. Any of us could be at any time. It's just luck, really. It's nothing I did or didn't do,\" Hamlin said, stunned by the comparison. \"I had the same risk factors as everyone else.\"",
      "Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley, said the seemingly random nature of who gets dropped and when has much to do with insurance companies' complicated risk models.",
      "\"They're all trying to manage their exposure,\" Collier said. \"If you think about wildfires, you don't want concentrated exposure.\"",
      "Wilson said SafeCo requested an inspection of his property before deciding not to renew his policy. Panicked, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with them, offering to clear brushes, trim trees near the roof, and other wildfire mitigation efforts.",
      "Wilson shopped around aggressively with his insurance agent but to no avail, and resigned himself to the FAIR Plan, assuming he would eventually find private insurance again.",
      "There was another catch: Wilson said he couldn't get comprehensive replacement cost coverage on the FAIR Plan because his roof was too old. Instead, he ended up with what is known as \"actual cash value\" coverage, which greatly limits the payout based on the physical depreciation of what was lost.",
      "\"We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and that's very, very painful,\" said Bach of United Policyholders.",
      "Citing rising fire risks and other problems, seven of the top 12 insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in California in 2023. State regulations give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing policies in high-risk areas, including consideration of climate change in premiums and passing the costs of reinsurance to consumers.",
      "But those are only short-term solutions, said Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018. He pointed to Florida, where officials have \"done everything the insurers asked California to do\" but yielded little success.",
      "\"We're marching steadily towards an uninsurable future in the United States because we're not doing enough fast enough to address the underlying cause, which is climate change,\" Jones said.",
      "Unless governments take on the financial burden of serious mitigation efforts, the price of California's fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, Collier of UC Berkeley said. That could be the underinsured \u2014 like Wilson \u2014 swallowing their personal losses, or all California homeowners collectively saddled with increased premiums, or both. State Farm, California's largest insurance company, this week urged the state to approve an emergency rate hike of 22% for homeowner policies starting in May after processing nearly 8,700 claims and paying out more than $1 billion to policyholders for the LA fires.",
      "\"There's a huge amount of risk in the system and there's a big question of who is going to pay for this,\" Collier said.",
      "Wilson expects he'll have to take out loans to rebuild. He's considering joining a lawsuit against Southern California Edison that alleges the utility's equipment sparked the blaze, in hopes of receiving settlement money.",
      "But with a baby on the way, Wilson said he can't fathom living in limbo on the FAIR Plan forever, and he's thinking about leaving California if private insurance remains out of reach.",
      "\"I don't want to have to be prepared to maybe lose everything again,\" Wilson said. \"Stuck paying for an insurance that doesn't cover anything. You don't want to live in a risky area. You don't have the safety net.\"",

    "summary": "Mattel executive says it may have to charge consumers more for its toys because of higher tariff costs on imports from China.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's move to tack an additional 10% tariff on U.S. imports from China could lead Mattel to hike the price of its Barbie, Hot Wheels and other toys.",
      "Mattel Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said in an earnings call with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday that roughly 40% of the company's toys are made in China, while noting that is less than the industry average of 80%. Overall, the fresh U.S. levies on Chinese good affect about 20% of Mattel's global production.",
      "\"Against the tariff, we have a range of mitigating actions,\" including \"potential price increases,\" he said.",
      "\"We do work closely with our retail partners to achieve the right balance and always keep consumers in mind when we consider pricing actions,\" DiSilvestro added.",
      "Mr. Trump has also imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico, where Mattel sources almost 10% of its products, and on Canada. On Monday, the president paused those tariffs for at least 30 days after Mexico and Canada agreed to heighten security at their respective borders with the U.S.",
      "Mattel executives spoke to analysts after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales that surpassed expectations, with its vehicle toy category \u2014 fueled by its Hot Wheels brand \u2014 its fastest-growing segment.",
      "Demand for dolls and baby gear fell, with the former \"down primarily due to Barbie as we wrapped the movie in the prior year,\" Mattel CEO Ynon Kreis said in the call.",
      "Toy sellers fear the steeper U.S. tariffs on China will hurt their business.",
      "\"We're going to suffer as a small business, but so is everyone in this country,\" Dan Marshall, co-owner of family-run Mischief Toy Store in St. Paul, Minnesota, told CBS News Minnesota this week. Marshall said there are few toy manufacturers left in the U.S., and the tariffs could have an adverse impact.",
      "\"If we have to raise prices, we will. But obviously, we're trying to bring in products now, earlier in the year so we don't have to do that,\" he said.",
      "Implementing the 10% tariff on China, along with the 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico that are now on hold, would cost the typical U.S. household more than $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",

      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team has been given \"read only\" access to the Treasury Department's federal payment system, and federal expenditures have not been affected, the Treasury said in a letter to Congress late Tuesday.",
      "The letter, from Jonathan Blum, a Treasury official, said that a review of the Treasury's Fiscal Service payment system has not caused \"payments for obligations such as Social Security and Medicare to be delayed or re-routed.\"",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's control of a federal payment system is raising concerns about funding for programs like Social Security and the safety of personal data.",
    "story": [
      "With Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gaining control of the Treasury Department's payment system, consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers are raising alarms about the group's access to the federal government's financial spigot, as well as sensitive data such as the Social Security numbers of most taxpayers.",
      "DOGE, a Trump administration task force assigned to find ways to reduce federal spending, now has access to a Treasury unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks and federal salaries, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Musk's access to the payment system is raising concerns as it comes just days after the White House ordered a broad freeze\u00a0on federal grants and loans, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. That same day, state Medicaid programs said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "While the White House later rescinded the memo and a judge halted the freeze, DOGE's control of the Treasury's payment system raises questions about the Trump administration's ability to halt the flow of federal funds for programs including Medicare and Social Security. It's also causing concerns about DOGE's access to the personal and financial information of most taxpayers.",
      "\"There's no community of Americans that this system does not touch, and so I think the concern is that access to this system including personally identifiable information has been ceded to the president's billionaire friend for reasons that are passing understanding,\" Donald K. Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There are \"quite real risks\" that DOGE \"could potentially undermine that system and threaten millions of Americans from getting payments that they are due,\" he added.",
      "Musk's access to the Treasury payment system has sparked concern from Democratic lawmakers including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, while a lawsuit was filed on Monday alleging \"unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information\" to Musk and DOGE. The lawsuit, filed by two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, names U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the Treasury as defendants.",
      "\"Controlling the system could allow the Trump Administration to 'unilaterally' \u2014 and illegally \u2014 cut off payments for millions of Americans, putting at risk the financial security of families and businesses based on political favoritism or the whims of Mr. Musk and those on his team who have worked their way inside,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a Feb. 2 letter to Bessent.",
      "She added, \"It could also give them access to millions of Americans' personal and financial information that is protected by law.\"",
      "The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "However, CBS News obtained a letter sent from Jonathan Blum, a legislative affairs official with the Treasury Department, to members of Congress Tuesday, which claimed that DOGE will only have \"read-only\" access to the department's data.",
      "The letter stated that Tom Krause, a member of Musk's DOGE team who has been brought in as a Treasury Department employee, will \"have read-only access to the coded data of the Fiscal Service's payment systems\" as part of an \"operational efficiency assessment.\"",
      "\"This is similar to the kind of access that Treasury provides to individuals reviewing Treasury systems, such as auditors, and that follows practices associated with protecting the integrity of the systems and business processes,\" the letter read, describing Krause as a \"longtime technology executive.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?",
      "The Treasury has long been the federal government's checkbook, tasked with handling payments for individual agencies based on funds appropriated by Congress. Its systems control the flow of over $6 trillion in payments to American families, businesses and other recipients each year.",
      "The Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service handles most of those payments. About 90 cents of every $1 in federal payments are sent through the little-known division.",
      "In fiscal 2023, the unit disbursed nearly 1.3 billion payments totaling $5.4 trillion, according\u00a0to\u00a0the agency. Almost 97% of the payments were made electronically and all were made on time, it noted.",
      "How did DOGE get control of the payment system?",
      "The executive\u00a0order\u00a0signed by President Trump that created DOGE directed all agencies to make sure it was given \"full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems and IT systems.\" DOGE itself is not a federal department.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, gained control of the system after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary, David Lebryk, resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk stepped down after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data, the Washington Post had reported.",
      "On Sunday, Musk\u00a0stated\u00a0that DOGE had stopped payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services to Lutheran Family Services, a faith-based charity that had been offering social services to refugees.",
      "Could this impact Social Security?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are raising concerns about the potential impact on government programs including Social Security, although neither Musk nor Mr. Trump have flagged Social Security as a target for cuts.",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump has said he will preserve Social Security, and while on the campaign trail he vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security Income. But because the Bureau of the Fiscal Services sends monthly checks to more than 70 million Social Security beneficiaries, some advocates say they're worried.",
      "Musk and DOGE \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, in an email. \"Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits \u2014 or their personal data.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Jan. 31 letter to Bessent that he's concerned that Social Security checks could be impacted, \"whether intentional or unintentional.\"",
      "\"It appears that Musk's behavior is forcing out highly qualified and experienced career public servants in order to get his way and fulfill Trump's goal of eviscerating the federal budget, including potentially by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for millions of Americans who are already struggling to pay their bills or buy groceries,\" he wrote.",
      "In a response to Wyden's letter, however, Jonathan Blum, a legislative affairs official at Treasury, told Wyden that DOGE personnel are only only able to read \"coded data\" in the federal payment system and cannot change scheduled systems. DOGE \"has not caused payments for obligations such as Social Security and Medicare to be delayed or re-routed,\" Blum wrote.",
      "Bloomberg was the first to report on the letter.",
      "Warren said Blum's letter raised more questions than answers. \"It asserts that a set of Treasury staff members have 'read-only' access but fails to answer questions about non-Treasury employees, like those working for Elon Musk and DOGE,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Does Musk have access to taxpayers' personal data?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are also raising concerns about DOGE's access to personal data for millions of American taxpayers. Because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service distributes tax refunds and Social Security payments, it has access to the Social Security numbers and bank accounts of recipients.",
      "Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, didn't respond to requests for comment but did\u00a0repost an Associated Press article on X\u00a0with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Access to that personal information could pose risks to taxpayers, according to data safety experts.",
      "\"Traditionally, access to this information has been highly restricted and among the most secure information the U.S. government holds,\" said James E. Lee, the president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"This is the kind of information that, if it found its way into the hands of a bad actor, could lead to a wide range of identity crimes \u2014 impersonation to open new accounts or access existing ones, theft of the funds in an existing banking account, applying for new state or federal government benefits, and filing false tax returns among other forms of identity fraud.\"",
      "The data is also sensitive because it could be useful to intelligence agencies in other nations, including the personal data of government employees or ties that businesses have with the U.S. government, Lee noted.",
      "That concern was echoed by Sen. Wyden, who in the Jan. 31 letter to Bessent questioned granting access to sensitive information to Musk due to significant business interests in China, noting that Tesla operates its largest factory in China. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "The world's two biggest economies are on the brink of an economically destructive trade war. Here's what experts think could happen next.",
    "story": [
      "The quick-fire volley of tariffs between the U.S. and China in recent days has heightened global fears of a new trade war between the world's two largest economies. Yet while experts think the battle is likely to escalate, they also say the early skirmishes offer hope for an agreement on trade and other key issues that could head off a larger conflict.",
      "After the Trump administration's additional 10% levy on Chinese imports took effect Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff\u00a0on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars, that is set to kick in Feb. 10. China also put limits on exports of vital minerals used in high-tech products; opened an antitrust probe into Google; and placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list \u2014 PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.",
      "Notably, however, the U.S. opted to hit China with a relatively modest tariff, rather than levies of up to 60%, as President Trump had previously threatened. For its part, Beijing also pulled its punches by targeting less vital U.S. sectors, leaving the door open for the sides to reach a deal.",
      "\"I think [Mr. Trump] backed off bigger Chinese tariffs because it became clear to him that it would eliminate any possibility of negotiation,\" trade policy expert William Reinsch, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for export administration and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It would be trade prohibitive, and they would regard it basically as an act of economic warfare. So I think he went with a number that would not prevent future negotiations and would still send a signal, so he ended up with 10%.\"",
      "For now, Wall Street investors are also taking the countries' fresh trade sanctions in stride, betting that neither Mr. Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping are eager to start a mutually destructive economic war.",
      "\"It is all rhetoric for now. This is the negotiation stage,\" said Bill Dendy, a financial strategist at investment bank Raymond James. \"It is like two brothers starting to talk smack, and they'll start to throw punches, but they don't want to hurt each other. It's not good for anybody if it gets out of hand.\"",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, told investors in a report that China's retaliatory measures have \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage.\"",
      "Even such efforts to avert a full-blown trade war could falter, spurring Mr. Trump to pursue a harder line against China, which he has long claimed uses a range of unfair practices that disadvantage U.S. businesses and workers.",
      "\"Edge of a cliff\"",
      "Reinsch said he expects Mr. Trump and Xi to hold discussions toward a deal that could lead to tariffs being repealed, or at least put on hold. \"These are all leverage moves,\" Reinsch said. \"The purpose is to force a negotiation on whatever it is [Mr. Trump] wants to negotiate, and he is good at brinkmanship. He goes right up to the edge of the cliff like he did with Canada and Mexico, and then he backed off in a way that allowed him to declare victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Feb. 1 announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. But the U.S. quickly\u00a0paused those duties for one month\u00a0after leaders of both countries said they would increase their efforts to curb the flow of illicit drugs and migrants into the U.S.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would invest $1.3 billion in better protecting its southern border.",
      "\"Trudeau and Sheinbaum figured out that that's the way to play it. If Trump is given an off-ramp where he can say, 'Ok, I won,' he'll take it, and that's what happened,\" Reinsch said.",
      "Whether such dynamics will ultimately work with China, and whether Xi is willing to indulge them, remains uncertain. After all, during Mr. Trump's first term he repeatedly imposed tariffs on China, leading Beijing to retaliate each time. Some experts think Trump officials will have to push much harder to obtain the kind of changes likely to satisfy Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This marks the fifth time in a row that Beijing has retaliated to tariffs, rather than make needed reforms. The first four times happened during Trump's first term and also got zero results. At some point, President Trump needs to figure out that tariffs will not get him what he wants from China,\" Ryan Young, senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that favors deregulation, said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Risks for consumers",
      "The risks of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China are considerable, including rising inflation.",
      "\"If we continue to go down this road, that can be very detrimental to the U.S. consumer because it is the consumer that pays for these tariffs, as costs not easily absorbed by industries that have tight margins already,\" Dendy said.",
      "Unless the countries find a breakthrough, \"Americans can expect to pay a lot more for their technology goods, as well as their clothing and other things,\" he added.",
      "By contrast, U.S. prices are unlikely to soar in the short-term even if the conflict continues, economists note. For one, rising tariffs would likely slow economic growth, dampening inflation as consumers and businesses pare spending. Reinsch also notes that many American companies that import goods from China have prepared for the prospect of higher costs by preemptively building their inventories.",
      "One area where U.S. consumers could feel an immediate impact \u2014 their purchases of cheap clothing from Chinese fast-fashion retailers Shein and Temu. The new U.S. tariffs on China eliminate an exemption for packages worth less than $800, meaning that low-value goods are now subject to the levies.",
      "The U.S. receives roughly 1 billion such shipments annually.",
      "\"If you are Temu and Shein, you will probably to a hit on two grounds. They will have to start paying tariffs on dresses and T-shirts, so they will take a hit,\" Reinsch said. Those costs would be passed on the shoppers. Additionally, Mr. Trump has asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection to inspect low-value packages to screen them for fentanyl, which could create shipping delays.\"",
      "Implementing the 10% tariff on China, along with the 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico that are now on hold, would cost the typical U.S. household more than $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",

      "The ownership of the Proud Boys' trademark is now in the hands of a Black church that the group vandalized in 2020.",
      "The Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., was granted ownership of the group's trademark in a Feb. 3 ruling from Judge Tanya M. Jones Bosier of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The decision also gives the Metropolitan AME Church a lien on the trademark and the power to block the Proud Boys from using the trademark or selling licensed goods, like T-shirts or hats, without the church's approval.",
      "Reached for comment, former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio pointed to a statement he\u00a0posted on X. In it, he said the judge should be impeached and the church's nonprofit status revoked. The court's decision had been\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by the New York Times.",

      "The ruling on the Proud Boys' copyright stems from an incident on Dec. 12, 2020, when members of the all-male right-wing group attended a \"stop the steal\" event in Washington, D.C., and also attacked the Metropolitan AME Church by climbing over a fence to get onto church property, where they destroyed a \"Black Lives Matters\" sign, according to court documents. A court ordered the Proud Boys to pay the church $2.8 million, money that the group has failed to pay, the documents note.",
      "As a result, the court gave the Metropolitan AME Church ownership of the trademark, providing them with the right to deny use of the group's name and yellow-and-black laurel wreath symbol.",

      "In addition to the tariffs and Google probe, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products.

      "This time, analysts said, China is much better prepared to counter.",
      "\"They have a much more developed export control regime. We depend on them for a lot of critical minerals: gallium, germanium, graphite, a host of others.

      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, let's start with the ones that are popular.",
      "And, again, these echo a lot of what we saw in the campaign. The idea of deporting those in the country illegally continues to be popular. We saw that in the campaign. Sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, again, majority in favor. We'd seen that in the campaign.",
      "For his supporters in particular, the focus on ending DEI is popular. We had seen in the campaign a lot of them thought those processes had gone too far. There are some other things in here that get more mixed reviews, I will add.",
      "The idea of the U.S. taking over Gaza is not seen as a good idea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Something he floated at a press conference this past week.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: He did, but it also gives you a little insight into how people are processing Donald Trump and what he does, because then, for a lot of his supporters, they say, well, that's not really his goal. That's a negotiating tactic.",
      "And then, on tariffs, those are not as popular. Those are things that the majority \u2013 with the exception of the ones on China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: People think it will raise prices. And that's important context here too, because people are still sensitive to price increases. A lot of them report that prices haven't gone down.",
      "Remember that Donald Trump won the election on inflation, and that was a big reason. And what we find now is two-thirds of people saying that they don't think the administration is focused enough on lowering prices. And that stands out as one of those big gaps when you talk about initial preferences, initial expectations and what's getting delivered.",
      "That's certainly going to be something to watch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's interesting, because, throughout the campaign, he was abundantly clear that tariffs were something he wanted to use. And we talked quite a lot about possible impact on inflation.",
      "I know you also polled on President Trump's work with Elon Musk and this so-called DOGE, Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're all kind of learning what it is. What do people think of it?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, exactly on that point, we're all sort of learning this, so I think this will take a while to play out.",
      "Initially, you get very partisan responses on the role that Elon Musk should or should not play. You get a majority of Republicans saying he should have at least some influence, though it's more of the MAGA base that really wants him to have a lot, and a lot of Democrats in opposition.",
      "Part of this is, too, the broad goals of cutting spending, of cutting foreign aid have things that have long been in the polling popular with Republicans. But in terms of the impact and approach, that may take a while for people to really see it play out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How you do it. And we will be talking about that ahead on the program.",
      "Anthony, thank you.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Republican Congressman Mike McCaul of Texas.",
      "Good morning. It's good to have you here.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-Texas): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to dig in to what has been happening, this mass confusion with USAID.",
      "There were 30 million metric tons of food sitting at a port in Houston all week because there weren't U.S. workers to unload the food aid, food American taxpayers had already bought, food that Secretary Rubio said should be delivered, but wasn't.",
      "How is this mass confusion increasing efficiency?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, if I could peel back on that a little bit, the confusion, I think, goes back to the Biden administration when they started to implement these woke policies of drag queen shows in Ecuador, when they started talking about LGBTQIA programs, like, say, in Latin American countries, how to sue Catholic governments, promoting atheism in Nepal, where you have Tibetan Buddhist monks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw the White House fact sheet on there. But this\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: This is what gave the USAID a black eye.",
      "I personally believe that USAID has a national security mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: If you go back to its inception in the '60s, under President Kennedy and the Cold War, it was to counter the Soviet Union. We need to return to the core mission principles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "Well, you have been a big supporter of USAID when you were chairman of House Foreign Affairs.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have talked about the great work that it does around the world.",
      "But back to this food aid, I mean, this isn't a theater program. This is food for starving people. How is getting it all locked up in these ports \u2013 I mean, it's the way it's being implemented that has drawn so much shock here. Do you think this is being done well?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, I think \u2013 so, the secretary, in response to all this \u2013 and, by the way, I \u2013 put holds on all those programs I was talking about that had nothing to do with the central core mission.",
      "However, the secretary made waivers on humanitarian assistance and PEPFAR, which has been the most successful global health program, initiated by President Bush, by the way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: The implementation of this is where I would urge the administration to move more expeditiously.",
      "I just got word about 10 minutes ago at the World Food Program now. These waivers are now being implemented, that it is being executed, that food will be going out, but, to your point, about $40 million in food rotting in these warehouses in Houston, about 500,000 metric tons on ships on the sea.",
      "The peace through food program dates back to the '50s\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: \u2026 after the Marshall Plan. It is to provide stability in fragile, unstable countries. It is to counter Russia, China and terrorism.",
      "It is our diplomatic power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Otherwise, we're talking about bullets, as Mattis talked about and Lindsey Graham.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, that if you don't fully fund the State Department, you have got to buy me more bullets. That's Mattis' line.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Cool.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on how this is being done, Secretary of State Rubio keeps saying he's issuing waivers and he's getting things moving. I'm glad the World Food Program now says food is moving.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there's a huge divide between what he's saying and then the fact that there weren't USAID workers there to actually load ships or move things. There weren't folks to process.",
      "It seems a fundamental misunderstanding between the bosses and the operators. Is this really how it should be done? Why not review and then take action?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And there's a debate about whether you should \u2013 there is a top-to-bottom review.",
      "I think, after what happened under the Biden administration, it absolutely needs to be reviewed to get back to the core mission, as I talked about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: So that is being done.",
      "At the same time, putting a halt on all humanitarian assistance and lifesaving medicines, I think that's where Secretary Rubio issued these waivers for a reason\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: \u2026 in consultation with the president, President Trump. And it seems to me his department needs to start implementing the waivers.",
      "Now, again, the World Food Program is doing that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have to be able to go back to work.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, that was before the courts, if people could even go back to work to implement what he's telling them to do.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And there is a temporary injunction on that issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: I would urge the State Department to put the adequate resources necessary to deliver this, because our foreign adversaries are looking at this.",
      "Just as they laughed at the Ecuador drag shows, they're also questioning what's happening now. And I think we need to have a strong presence in destabilized nations to keep out our adversaries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But do you think this was done intentionally, or are people like this individual Pete Marocco, who Secretary Rubio has authorized to run this, do they just not know how the department works or how USAID works?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: I really can't speak for him. I know that he's been in charge \u2013 put in charge of the foreign assistance program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should he come into Congress and answer questions, since there's a hearing on USAID this week?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, I do think the administration has provided, by the way, notification and consultation with the Foreign Affairs Committee that I chaired. And that is required under law.",
      "They have done that. I think, if they decide to terminate, that's a whole 'nother issue. My understanding is that they want to look at putting USAID underneath the State Department, which is not a novel concept.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: I mean, Madeleine Albright talked about this under\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And Bill Clinton and Warren Christopher talked about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Even Joe Biden talked about this.",
      "And I think putting it under State makes a lot of sense to me to provide the direct supervision and oversight.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: But you know how this department works, since you were the chair for so long of the committee overseeing it.",
      "When this Trump-appointed judge put that federal \u2013 the pause on the putting USAID workers on leave, he wrote in the opinion: \"No future lawsuit could undo the physical harm that might result if USAID employees are not informed of imminent security threats occurring in the countries to which they have relocated in the course of their service to the United States.\"",
      "He's saying that the messy way this rolled out put people in physical risk when they are deployed by our government to countries overseas. Did the secretary of state have any idea?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: The secretary of state issued the waivers for PEPFAR and for humanitarian both food and medicine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But people living and working in places like Syria aren't able to access computer systems and security warnings that are there.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: The \u2013 every \u2013 every president that comes in does a review.",
      "I would argue, though, that since the secretary's issued the waivers, that it's incumbent upon his subordinates now to implement these waivers so that we don't see what could happen where people are not getting their vaccines, they're not getting the HIV treatment, there are starving people in destabilized countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And then we see China and Russia.",
      "And, quite frankly, Lindsey Graham and I did the Global Fragility Act to impact the Sahel in Africa. That is turning into a terror safe haven. You got Ebola popping up in Uganda.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: These are serious issues that, if we don't start implementing waivers, you're going to see it get worse, not better.",
      "And I would urge the administration to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're striking a very different tone than Congressman Brian Mast, who was here last week. And he said there's a grift on the American people. He said PEPFAR and Americans shouldn't fund AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa because their governments might work with China.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: It's the best\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a divide in your party about this right now.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, it's the best \u2013 I can only speak to the program that President Bush started, and it was to save millions of lives.",
      "That is probably one of the \u2013 been the best goodwill missions in the United States and put the best face, no pun intended, on the nation overseas with our adversaries, countering them, with these people. We're saving their lives. The best global health program ever implemented by the United States was PEPFAR. I'd hate to see that go away.",
      "It will sunset once we achieve the mission. However, programs like that, when you look at the national security importance of USAID\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: \u2026 need to be maintained.",
      "And I go back to why it was implemented in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday night, the president ordered all foreign assistance to South Africa be halted and said we should prioritize the resettling of Afrikaner refugees. These are white South Africans.",
      "That means they will get priority over everyone, it seems, because there's a suspension of refugee entry into the United States, including those Afghan allies who worked along the United \u2013 alongside the United States.",
      "Are you going to try to help lift that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Yes, I believe \u2013 I did a comprehensive investigation that the debacle of Afghanistan that the Biden administration was responsible for\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: \u2026 including leaving our Afghan partners behind. Those\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should they get a carve-out from the Trump ban on refugees? Should the Afghans?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And I do believe that it was an unintended consequence that needs to be fixed.",
      "Look, we promised them that we would protect them when they worked with our service men and women in Afghanistan. These are the interpreters, the ones who were right alongside our combat veterans. They have these Special Immigrant Visas and P-1, P-2.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And it's my view that they should be allowed to go forward with the SIV program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And others.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And they have been vetted, by the way, Margaret. They have been vetted. Unlike some of the other groups they talk about, these have been vetted.",
      "They worked with our troops to defeat the Taliban, which, unfortunately, Biden surrendered to. But it seems to me we ought to live up to our word. Otherwise, down the road, in another conflict, no one's going to trust us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman McCaul, thank you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, who joins us this morning from Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY (R-Tennessee): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have a lot to get to with you today, but I want to start with the announcement from the White House that over 65,000 employees have accepted the offer to leave their jobs with pay through September 30. This is that deferred resignation program, or buyout, as it's called.",
      "Can you explain how putting federal workers on paid leave through September will save taxpayers money, if we're paying them not to work?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Margaret, eventually it will save taxpayers money.",
      "I think what President Trump is trying to do is be humane in the process of allowing them to make plans to find other employment. But I certainly think the government is far too big, far too bloated. And we're on a path now to start to see it shrink.",
      "This is the first step only, but we're moving in the right direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean the agencies won't hire replacements for these people who take the so-called buyout? Are you reducing head count?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think what we will see is each agency \u2013 yes, I think what we will see, Margaret, is each agency go through a top-to-bottom review to decide exactly what they need to do to deliver on behalf of the American public.",
      "As you know, there's been a lot of consternation and pearl-clutching about the activities of Elon Musk and his team. But their charge led by President Trump is to go in and find efficiencies, find opportunities and, frankly, deliver more of taxpayer dollars to the actual programs that are intended, less to overhead and administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you said, eventually, it will save money. I know you're on Appropriations Committee and you watch these things pretty closely here.",
      "When will it save money?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I would say certainly as soon as these people start to roll off the payroll. Again, I'm from the private sector, Margaret. My entire background has been in business.",
      "This is the way you do it. You come in, you look at the opportunities before you. President Trump has brought a new administration. And this is not unusual to take a hard look at these programs, and also to look for opportunities to cut bloat and waste.",
      "Look, we're $36 trillion in debt. Clearly, the American public needs\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 to see more accountability, more visibility, more performance for their taxpayer dollars.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And I think anyone who works in the private sector understands how layoffs work. The government is so unique, though, with laws establishing some of these agencies.",
      "And, as you know \u2013 and we will talk about it later in the program \u2013 some of this is tied up in the courts.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, since you're on banking, the budget director announced he's notified the Federal Reserve that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will no longer take congressional funding because it's not necessary.",
      "Elon Musk tweeted: \"Rest in peace.\"",
      "Can you tell us, did the White House inform\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I missed Elon Musk's tweet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Did the White House inform the Banking Committee that it's being dismantled? What does \"CFPB, rest in peace\" mean?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: So, I have had significant conversations with Russ Vought, who is our new OMB director.",
      "The CFPB has been out of control for some time. The way it's designed, I think, is unconstitutional. It has no oversight. It's been basically a reckless agency that's been allowed to go way beyond any mandate that I think was originally intended. So it's time to rein it in. And I'm applauding anything that we can do to bring more stability and more control to the federal government and take agencies like this back into some sort of sense of accountability and oversight.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what does that mean? Because it's established as an agency, and there are legal protections here.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, it was established as an agency that does not have the jurisdiction of the Congress.",
      "Its funding source is separate from us. It has no accountability. This is not the type of agency I think that the founding fathers contemplated. We actually contemplated a balance of power. Yet this rogue agency has been created. And, frankly, it's been used as a tool to come in and just hammer the American private sector and pursue initiatives that certain people like Rohit Chopra might have approved or Senator Elizabeth Warren might have approved, but this is not the way the American public should be funding and supporting programs of this nature.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So, a different government agency, USAID, and its fate is also in question. We looked at the Congressional Research Service definition here, because it was enshrined in law, USAID. It says, because Congress established it as independent within the executive branch, the president does not have the authority to abolish it. Congressional authorization would be required to abolish, move or consolidate USAID.",
      "So, have you \u2013 or do you expect Congress to actually authorize the president to dismantle and consolidate USAID?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think there's a tremendous appetite to do it, again, Margaret, because what we want to see is alignment of our programs with America's national security interest.",
      "USAID has been out of control. I have demanded accountability from a AID. They have refused it. As an appropriator, I have asked them to be very clear about, for example, their role funding Hamas in Gaza. They would not comply. They will not tell us what they do.",
      "Now that we start to find out some of the programs that AID has been funding, I mean, think about it, sex change operations in Guatemala, LGBTQ programs in Serbia, this is ridiculous. This is so beyond the pale.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. government does not sex change operations or fund Hamas. You know that, though. But you sit on\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: That is not true, Margaret. I couldn't get the secretary of state. I asked him three times to tell me that we were not funding Hamas to AID. He couldn't do it.",
      "And, frankly, what we found is that we've been funding, as American taxpayers, organizations\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any evidence that the United States government is terror \u2013 is funding a terrorist group?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Certainly, the funds that have gone to UNRWA. You saw the UNRWA members who were also Hamas members going In an attack on\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, that's \u2013 UNRWA is not a terrorist group. UNRWA is part of the United Nations.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: UNRWA is supporting terrorist groups.",
      "And if you look at what UNRWA has done, it's been so counter to our national interest. It's unbelievable that we would fund it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Since you're on Foreign Relations, let me ask you specifically what's happening inside the State Department right now. A gentleman named Darren Beattie has been appointed as acting undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs.",
      "He was fired from the first Trump administration after he attended a white nationalist convention. He's made a lot of inflammatory statements against women and minorities. If he couldn't work for the first Trump administration, how is he qualified to work now?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Margaret, I'm not familiar with Mr. Beattie or the claims that you raise.",
      "But if we want to talk about qualifications for people serving in the administration, why not look back at the prior administration? The only qualification Tony Blinken seemed to have to be secretary of state is that you organized 51 intelligence \u2013 so-called intelligence officials to forge a letter to say that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: If we want to talk about accountability and who should be serving, let's go back and look at the last administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is attending a white nationalist rally appropriate \u2013 if it wasn't appropriate to attend a white nationalist rally then, is it appropriate now?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I don't know anything about this, Margaret. I don't know anything about this\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, the secretary of state spoke about it earlier this week. So, Secretary Rubio does know about it.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tariffs. President Trump said he plans, as soon as this week, new reciprocal tariffs on everybody. It sounds like he's broadening out this trade war.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know exactly which goods or countries will be impacted in the coming days?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: So, I talked with President Trump on Friday about this broadly, Margaret. This is a concern that he has had for some time.",
      "As you know, I served in his previous administration and worked my heart out to get two trade agreements executed with Japan. I was the U.S. ambassador to Japan in his administration.",
      "Here's what we're trying to deal with, and it goes all the way back to World War II and the aftermath.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: We made very favorable terms of trade with countries whose economies have been devastated in Europe and Japan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: We should have time-limited that. We should have put some type of GDP per capita limit on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Because what we have now are countries that have very unfavorable and unfair terms that are fully developed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: So it's time to address this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I'm sorry.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: It's already begun to happen. President Trump and I talked \u2013 yes.",

      "Good to have you here.",
      "You have spoken quite a bit this week about what USAID meant in your life, particularly when you were living in a refugee camp for four years. And USAID, you talked about, helping to keep you alive. We know this week a federal judge will come to some kind of hearing and decision perhaps on what happens to all those government workers. Are the courts the main line of defense here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): Yes. I mean, what we are witnessing is a constitutional crisis. We are seeing an executive branch that has decided that they are no longer going to abide by the Constitution, in honoring Congress' role in the creation of the agencies, in their role in deciding where money is allocated. And so the only recourse we have since our congressional leadership, the speaker will not stop the executive, is through the judiciary. And this is, you know, when you think about the checks and balances that we have, the courts are the only recourse we have at the moment.",
      "And we have seen - and when we talk about the illegality of what the executive is doing, we have seen every single executive order that has been challenged in the courts, was found to be illegal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: And that, I think, should give faith to the American people that our courts are working as they should, the checks and balances are working.",

So - so we know that the - the votes are not there to dismantle the Department of Education. We know that the votes are not there to grant security clearances for them accessing Treasury. And - and so every single process that they are going through in implementing Trump's agenda -",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's interesting that the first place to focus is such a small portion of federal spending, to look at - at - at aid. But when you look at the popularity, Secretary Rubio has right in saying that it's getting harder to defend foreign aid because it's not popular.",
      "We saw the Chicago Council on Global Affairs surveyed American opinions on foreign policy and they found a growing number want to reduce economic and military aid to other countries.",

A lot of people hear the millions, billions, and they don't fully have a concept of what - what that actually means.",

      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was an active FBI agent who spoke with CBS's Scott Macfarlane last week. The agent asked for anonymity due to safety concerns, including the risk that private information about the individual could be made public, a practice known as doxxing.",
      "For more on that interview and the impact of the Trump administration's bureaucratic overhaul is Justice Department correspondent Scott Macfarlane. We're also joined by chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, homeland security contributor Samantha Vinograd, and cybersecurity expert and analyst Chris Krebs.",
      "It's good to have you all here.",
      "And even just trying to whittle this down to exactly what to ask you was hard because there has been so much happening.",
      "Scott, let's talk on the very immediate thing that was raised in that interview, physical security. You obtained an email from the acting FBI director that said he has concerns for the safety of personnel, as well as risks to their families.",
      "What exactly does he have in mind, and what's being done to protect them?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Let's take a moment to underscore the significance of that message. These are people who chase terrorists for a living. And there's an internal email they're worried about, a unique form of retribution at this moment. That gives you an indication the turmoil the FBI is in at this moment.",
      "There are two types of retribution these agents are concerned about. First of all, as you mentioned, the doxxing, that people are going to come after them and they're concerned that the January 6th rioters, now lionized, now galvanized, or their supporters and sympathizers will come after the agents who are responsible for nearly 1,600 arrests.",
      "But more fundamentally, and perhaps more immediately, they're worried about retribution for doing their jobs, professional retribution, that there will be a purge, firings, forced resignations that are going to gut America's joint terror task force, child predator task forces and violent crime units.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to be clear, FBI agents don't get to pick what assignments they get, just like the United States military does not get to pick it.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And this was not a Washington, D.C., investigation. This involved every field office of the FBI nationwide. They were assigned in communities from California to Connecticut.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sam, when you look at some of the national security implications here, it's not just the domestic law enforcement. The CIA offered a different early retirement and resignation option. The CIA director said if an individual works on a high-priority issue or has a specific language skill, they can't take the so-called buyout we've been talking about earlier in the program. They are trying to target these cutbacks in specific ways. Can you actually really do that and - and is this a good idea?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, I think it depends the subjectivity of how you define national security. I would argue that all of the CIA count as a critical national security position.",
      "But more broadly, Margaret, I worked for three presidents. They all had different approaches to the federal workforce. What concerns me with this administration's rapid elimination approach is that it creates a wildly uneven playing field with our adversaries.",
      "The KGB is not shedding agents. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not losing diplomats. What we have in this moment is tens of thousands of personnel taking the buyout, leaving their jobs. We have countless others on leave. We have others who are worried about taking certain assignments because of fear of retribution, or spending hours talking to family and lawyers about their professional options while being expected to do their day job.",
      "We don't have all hands on deck in a very dynamic threat environment. And longer term, I am concerned what this will do for recruitment to the federal government and redundancy. It takes years to train and equip a spy. It takes years to train an aid worker. So, coming back from the talent cuts that we're seeing could have a generational impact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that - the comparison was made early in the program, oh, well, in the private sectors they do buyout. Even in the private sector people can say, hey, we lost some institutional knowledge or expertise here. You're saying American government, the taxpayer invested in that expertise and that's what's being lost here.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: And there's no quick fix switch to turn it back on. It will be a longer term investment in getting talent back onto the field.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Chris, you know, in trying to whittle down who this applies to, who it doesn't, CBS has obtained an internal communication given out at homeland security, employees were told anyone working for Customs and Border Patrol can't take the buyout. ICE, other immigration related departments, TSA you can't, FEMA, parts of it at least you can't. And the agency you used to run, CISA, was singled out.",
      "But then we're seeing conflicting reports that say very different things about parts of that agency being affected and dismantled. Cybersecurity is the new frontier for warfare, right?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Absolutely. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So - so, what does this mean?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Well, it's not clear, right? Let - let's also step back a minute and recognize that President Trump, in his first administration, in 2018, established CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is when you worked for -",
      "CHRIS KREBS: That's what it - that's the agency I ran.",
      "And to your point the threat landscape it as active and dynamic as ever. And it's not as if we're, all of a sudden unplugging systems today that we weren't doing two to three months ago. It's becoming more digitized, more connected. And the opportunity space for the bad guys is also increasing. Even during the campaign the vice president's phone was accessed by Chinese threat actors. So, we have this opportunity right now to continue to invest in our cybersecurity defenses.",
      "So, the conversations I've had with CISA personnel is that they're going to hang on because the public service mission is so important to many of these individuals it could be making millions in the cybersecurity industry, in the private sector. They are committed to getting through this, to continuing to protect the American people, the American networks, the federal - the federal government. That's the opportunity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Noem said CISA has gotten far off mission. How was that received?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Well, I think to Sam's point, you know, every administration has a set of - policies and priorities that they - they go in, they review, they sometimes do it rapidly, sometimes do it slowly, at the beginning of the Biden administration, Scott, as we were talking about, the - they took down or disassembled the Department of Justice China Task Force. China is obviously a huge threat.",
      "There are elements of CISA, the elections security mission specifically, that was clearly spelled out in Project 2025 as a distraction, as something that's not core. And I will say that having worked with those people, they're American patriots. They are public servants. My hope is that as the administrative review process goes through, that they are provided opportunities to work elsewhere because they are - they're effective and there are other things that we have to continue to be doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to drill down more, but I - come back with everything these days, Jan, to the fundamental questions, is this legal? As our legal expert, you know, some of these buyouts are - are tied up in court. Is it legal?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Right. And we're going to have a hearing this week, tomorrow, on whether or not these pauses can remain. I think the judge is going to keep this pause in place, is kind of putting it on hold, even though this is one of the weaker of all the lawsuits that's been filed against these many executive orders.",
      "The argument is that Trump just went about this the wrong way. So, that's why it's different than when Bill Clinton cut over 200,000 jobs from the federal government when he was in office. He involved Congress.",
      "And that's a common theme with all of these lawsuits. And there are many. I mean, dozens and dozens from coast to coast that these executive orders, and doing these executive orders, Trump did it unilaterally. That - and he cannot do that. Like, he has to involve Congress. And he's usurping Congress' role.",
      "So, whatever the judge does in - in this case on the buyouts, you know, I think it does raise one interesting issue when you're talking about the impact on people and how some of these orders, as you guys were discussing, what about those 65,000 people who say they want those?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: They want to do this. They may have a claim now. They're relying on this. So, that raises a whole nother legal issue if these buyouts cannot proceed.",
      "So, all of this is going to take some time to sort out. The courts right now are definitely putting up, you know, yellow to red lights on a lot of these executive orders.",
      "But, you know, like our polling is showing, like I - this, to me, regardless of whether these end up being legal losses, losses in the courts, they're political wins. It's - it's a victory for Trump because he's showing that he's doing, as our polling reflects, what he promised in the campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: And so, you know, regardless of how many of these end up surviving at the end of the day -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Trump can still say this was a win for him politically.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And we keep coming back to that, but it's not just what you do it's how you do it. And that's what I think is so illuminating to hear from you all from inside the agencies.",
      "Scott, I want to come back to you because the attorney general, Bondi, dissolved an FBI task force that worked to uncover covert efforts by Russia, China, Iran and others to manipulate voters. There seems to be an effort to refocus the Justice Department. What's that focus?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes, there were some first-day orders when Pam Bondi arrived at main justice this week, including repurposing this foreign influence task force the FBI has, trying to shepherd its resources more towards drug cartels versus the ongoing kinetic foreign influence campaigns, which have been part of our country for some time now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That Chris was mentioning, right.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: That - that Chris knows quite well.",
      "I think their concern though is broader than just that task force. If there is a gutting of FBI personnel, either by giving them new jobs that aren't what they're there for or firing them, you can't just replace an FBI agent tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It takes many months of training, background checks, polygraphs, they go to Quantico. It takes a long time to deploy, years to get them up to speed. And for a supervisor we're told it takes five to seven years to get somebody in place. That's something that goes beyond the Trump term.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, on the legal question, Democrats are throwing around constitutional crisis as a phrase.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I don't see that yet. I mean so far the president is not ignoring judicial orders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So far.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two weeks in.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: And they're appealing them. They're, you know, so I -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the - on the congressional consent portion, though, we're not - you did hear from - from Congressman McCaul that, well, if it's in statute, that's another matter. You have to at least consult with Congress before you destroy an agency or dismantle it.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Right. And all of these executive orders raise similar legal issues, but they're different because they depend on what the law at issue actually says. So, the USAID, you know, trying to put those employees that you were talking about on administrative leave, I think there's about 3,000 of them, and then kind of the force evacuation from their host countries, a very highly regarded federal district court judge here in D.C., a Trump appointees, put that on hold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: And pointed to a specific federal law that says that he has to consult Congress before you're going to dismantle or really kind of reorganize USAID.",
      "So, that one, that's a - that's a pretty strong lawsuit right there. That's a strong one. But that judge also upheld part of Secretary Rubio's order that would freeze future funding of USAID projects. So, (INAUDIBLE).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chris, quickly, on the national security questions of having these DOGE employees, which the White House says have security clearances and are only looking inside systems, read only, is there risk?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Well, I - theoretically there are various risks associated with access to systems. You - you could have sensitive information, proprietary information. You could be plugging in systems that aren't necessarily clean or haven't gone through the normal protocols for access to these government systems. You could also see some of these folks getting targeted by Chinese or Russian actors -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: For compromise, for extortion and exploitation. But the real - I, you know, the opportunity that I'm looking for out of DOGE specifically is to radically transform government IT. We have to do it. It's been too long.",

    "summary": "Rep. Ilhan Omar said the executive branch's recent actions have created a \"constitutional crisis.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, said Sunday that she doesn't think Republicans have the support in Congress to approve the Trump administration's gutting of federal agencies and programs, saying \"that's why they're not bringing it through Congress.\"",
      "\"Every single process that they are going through in implementing Trump's agenda is, at the moment, illegal, and they know they don't have the support for it in Congress,\" Omar said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Recent actions that the Trump administration has argued are being put in place to make the government more efficient have prompted confusion through corners of the federal government and beyond, including actions with serious implications for the main U.S. agency handling foreign assistance. On Friday, a judge prevented the Trump administration from placing 2,200 employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development, known as USAID, on administrative leave, after a pause on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID the week prior.",
      "Omar, who was born in Somalia and has said she benefited from USAID programs while living in a refugee camp as a child, argued Sunday that USAID has support \"not just with Democrats, but with Republicans.\" And she noted that even with GOP control of both the House and Senate, \"the votes are not there\" for other recent developments, like granting Elon Musk's team access to Treasury Department data or the possibility of dismantling the Department of Education.",
      "With the dynamic, Omar characterized the current moment as a \"constitutional crisis.\"",
      "\"We are seeing an executive branch that has decided that they are no longer going to abide by the Constitution in honoring Congress's role in the creation of the agencies, in their role in deciding where money is allocated,\" Omar said.",
      "Omar said that \"the only recourse we have\" is through the judiciary branch, noting that the bulk of the Trump administration's controversial and sweeping moves to overhaul the federal bureaucracy so far have been temporarily halted by judges, including some who were Republican-appointed. She said the moves by judges \"should give faith to the American people.\"",
      "\"Our courts are working as they should,\" Omar said. \"The checks and balances are working. What is not working is the way that the executive is behaving and the congressional leadership that is failing the American people.\"",
      "On the issue of foreign aid more broadly, Omar acknowledged that it hasn't always been popular among Americans, which she attributed to a messaging disconnect on where the aid is going and for what use.",
      "\"A lot of people hear the millions, billions, and they don't fully have a concept of what that actually means, the lives it touches, and how important it is \u2014 both the soft power that we have as a country, how it keeps us competitive around the world, how it buys us goodwill,\" Omar said.",
      "Meanwhile, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, argued that USAID \"needs to be reviewed to get back to the core mission,\" while stressing that \"we need to have a strong presence in destabilized nations to keep out our adversaries.\"",
      "Trump ally Sen. Bill Hagerty was asked on \"Face the Nation\" about Congress' views on dismantling and consolidating USAID. The Tennessee Republican argued that there's a \"tremendous appetite\" to do so, saying \"USAID has been out of control.\"",
      "\"What we want to see is alignment of our programs with America's national security interest,\" he said.",
      "Hagerty also defended the Trump administration's proposed buyouts for federal workers, a deadline for which a judge temporarily halted\u00a0on Thursday, saying it's \"not unusual to take a hard look at these programs\" and adding that he expects each agency to go through a \"top to bottom review.\"",
      "\"There's been a lot of consternation and pearl clutching about the activities of Elon Musk and his team, but their charge, led by President Trump, is to go in and find efficiencies, find opportunities, and, frankly, deliver more of taxpayer dollars to the actual programs that are intended, less to overhead in administration,\" Hagerty added.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have a lot to get to with you today, but I want to start with the announcement from the White House that over 65,000 employees have accepted the offer to leave their jobs with pay through September 30. This is that deferred resignation program, or buyout, as it's called. Can you explain how putting federal workers on paid leave through September will save taxpayers money if we're paying them not to work?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: Margaret, eventually it will save taxpayers money. I think what President Trump is trying to do is be humane in the process of allowing them to make plans to find other employment, but I certainly think the government is far too big, far too bloated, and we're on a path now to start to see it shrink. This is the first step only, but we're moving in the right direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean the agencies won't hire replacements for these people who- who take the so called buyout? Are you reducing headcount?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think what we'll see is each agency- yeah, I think what we'll see, Margaret, is each agency go through a top to bottom review to decide exactly what they need to do to deliver on behalf of the American public. As you know, there's been a lot of consternation and pearl clutching about the activities of Elon Musk and his team, but their charge, led by President Trump, is to go in and find efficiencies, find opportunities, and, frankly, deliver more of taxpayer dollars to the actual programs that are intended less to overhead in administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you said eventually it will save money. I know you're on Appropriations Committee, and you watch these things pretty closely here. When will it save money?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: Well, I would say certainly as soon as these people start to roll off the payroll again. I'm from the private sector Margaret. My entire background has been in business. This is the way you do it. You come in, you look at the opportunities before you. President Trump has brought a new administration in. This is not unusual, to take a hard look at these programs and also to look for opportunities to cut bloat and waste. Look, we're $36 trillion in debt. Clearly, the American- the American public needs to see more accountability, more visibility, more performance for their taxpayer dollars.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, and I think anyone who works in the private sector understands how layoffs work. The government is so unique, though, with laws establishing some of these agencies. And as you know, and we'll talk about it later in the program, some of this is tied up in the courts. Specifically, since you're on Banking, the budget director announced he's notified the Federal Reserve that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will no longer take congressional funding because it's not necessary. Elon Musk tweeted, rest in peace. Can you tell us, did the White House inform--",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: -- I missed Elon Musk's tweet--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the bank- Yeah, did- did the White House inform the Banking committee that it's being dismantled? What does CFPB rest in peace mean?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: So I've- I've had significant conversations with Russ Vought, who is our new OMB director. The CFPB has been out of control for some time. The way it's designed, I think, is unconstitutional. It has no oversight. It's been basically a reckless agency that's been allowed to go way beyond any mandate that I think was originally intended. So it's time to rein it in, and I'm applauding anything that we can do to bring more stability, more control to the federal government and take agencies like this back, you know, back into some sort of sense of accountability and oversight.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what does that mean? Because it's established as an agency and there are legal protections here.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: Well, it was established as- as an agency that does not have the jurisdiction of the Congress. Its funding source is separate from us. It has no accountability. This is not the type of agency, I think, that the Founding Fathers contemplated. We- we actually contemplated a balance of power. Yet this rogue agency has been created, and frankly, it's been used as a tool to come in and just hammer the American private sector and pursue initiatives that you, know, certain- certain people like Rohit Chopra might have approved, or Senator Elizabeth Warren might have approved. But this is not the way the American public should be funding and supporting programs of this nature.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so a different government agency, USAID, and its fate is also in question. We looked at the Congressional Research Service definition here, because it was enshrined in law, USAID, it says, because Congress established it as independent within the executive branch, \"the President does not have the authority to abolish it.\" Congressional authorization would be required to abolish, move, or consolidate USAID. So, have you or do you expect Congress to actually authorize the President to dismantle and consolidate USAID?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think there's a tremendous appetite to do it. Again, Margaret, because what we want to see is alignment of our programs with America's national security interest. USAID has been out of control. I've demanded accountability from AID. They've refused it. As an appropriator, I've, you know, asked them to be very clear about, for example, their role in funding Hamas in Gaza. They would not comply. They will not tell us what they do. Now that we start to find out some of the programs that AID has been funding, if you think about it, sex change operations in Guatemala, LGBTQ programs in Serbia--",

      "SEN. HAGERTY: And that is not true, Margaret, I couldn't get the Secretary of State- I asked him three times to tell me that we were not funding Hamas through AID. He couldn't do it. And frankly, what we've found is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any evidence that the United States government is- ter-",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: --that we've been funding, as American taxpayers, organizations--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --is- is funding a terrorist group?",

      "SEN. HAGERTY: UNRWA is supporting terrorist groups. And if you look at what UNRWA has done, it's been so counter to our national interest. It's unbelievable that we would fund it.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Since you're on Foreign Relations, let me ask you specifically, what's happening inside the State Department right now. A gentleman named Darren Beattie has been appointed as acting Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. He was fired from the first Trump administration after he attended a white nationalist convention. He's made a lot of inflammatory statements against women and minorities. If he couldn't work for the first Trump administration, how is he qualified to work now?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: Margaret, I'm not familiar with Mr. Beattie or the claims that you raised, but- we want to talk about qualifications for people serving the administration, why not look back at the prior administration? The only qualification Tony Blinken seemed to have to be Secretary of State is that he organized 51 intelligence- so-called intelligence officials to forge a letter to say that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --earlier this week, so Secretary Rubio does know about it. Tariffs. President Trump said he plans, as soon as this week, new reciprocal tariffs on everybody. It sounds like he's broadening out this trade war. Do you know exactly which goods or countries will be impacted in the coming days?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: So, I talked with President Trump on Friday about this broadly, Margaret. This is a concern that he has had for some time. As you know, I served in his previous administration and worked my heart out to get two trade agreements executed with Japan. I was U.S. Ambassador to Japan in his administration. Here's what we're trying to deal with, and it goes all the way back to World War II and the aftermath.",

      "REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL: Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to dig into what has been happening, this mass confusion with USAID. There were 30 million metric tons of food sitting at a port in Houston all week because there weren't US workers to unload the food aid, food American taxpayers had already bought.\u00a0 Food that Secretary Rubio said should be delivered, but wasn't. How is this mass confusion increasing efficiency?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, if I could peel back on that a little bit, the- the confusion, I think, goes back to the Biden administration when they started to implement these woke policies of drag queen shows in Ecuador, when they started talking about LGBTQIA programs like, say, in Latin American countries, how to sue Catholic governments, promoting atheism in Nepal, where you have Tibetan Buddhist monks--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I saw the- I saw the White House Fact Sheet on this, but this--",
      "REP. MCCAUL: --but this- this is- this is what gave the- USAID a black eye. I personally believe that USAID has a national security mission. If you go back to its inception in the '60s under President Kennedy and the Cold War, it was to counter the Soviet Union. We need to return to the core mission principles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, you have been a big supporter of USAID. When you're chairman of House Foreign Affairs, you've talked about the great work that it does around the world. But back to this food aid. I mean, this isn't a- a theater program. This is food for starving people. How is getting it all locked up in these ports- I mean, it's the way it's being implemented that has drawn so much shock here. Do you think this is being done well?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, I think- so the Secretary, in response to all this, and by the way, I put holds on all those programs I was talking about, had nothing to do with the central core mission. However, the Secretary made waivers on humanitarian assistance in PEPFAR, which has been the most successful global health program, initiated by President Bush, by the way. The implementation of this is where I would urge the administration to move more expeditiously. I just got word about 10 minutes ago that the World Food Program now, these waivers are now being implemented, that it is being executed, that food will be going out. But to your point, about $40 million in food rotting in these warehouses in Houston, about 500,000 metric tons on ships, you know, on the sea. The peace through food program dates back to the '50s, after the Marshall Plan. It is to provide stability in- in fragile, unstable countries. It is to counter Russia, China, and terrorism. It is our diplomatic power. Otherwise, we're talking about bullets, as Mattis talked about, and Lindsey Graham.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, if you don't fully fund the State Department, you got to buy me more bullets--",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Cool.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that's Mattis's line. But on how this is being done, Secretary of State Rubio keeps saying he's issuing waivers and he's getting things moving. I'm glad the World Food Program now says food is moving, but there's a huge divide between what he's saying and then the fact that there weren't USAID workers there to actually load ships or move things. There weren't folks to process. It seems a fundamental misunderstanding between the bosses and the operators. Is this really how it should be done? Why not review and then take action?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: And there's a debate about whether you should, you know- there is a top to bottom review. I think, after what happened under the Biden administration, it absolutely needs to be reviewed to get back to the core mission, as I talked about. So that is being done. At the same time putting a halt on all humanitarian assistance and life saving medicines, I think that's where- Secretary Rubio issued these waivers for a reason, in consultation with the president, President Trump, and it seems to me, his department needs to start implementing the waivers. Now again, the World Food Program--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, people have to be able to go back to work. I mean, that was before the courts said people could even go back to work to implement what he's telling them to do.",
      "REP. MCCAUL: And there is a temporary injunction on that issue. I would urge the State Department to put the adequate resources necessary to deliver this, because our foreign adversaries are looking at this, just as they laughed at the Ecuador drag shows. They're also questioning what's happening now. And I think we need to have a strong presence in destabilized nations to keep out our adversaries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think this was done intentionally, or are- are people like this individual, Pete Marocco, who Secretary Rubio has authorized to run this, do they just not know how the department works? Or how USAID--",
      "REP. MCCAUL: I really can't speak for him, I know that he's been in charge- put in charge of the Foreign Assistance Program--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you bring him into Congress and answer questions since there's a hearing on USAID this week?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, I- I do think- the administration has provided, by the way, notification and consultation with the Foreign Affairs committee that I chaired, and that is required, under law. They have done that. I think if they decide to terminate, that's a whole nother issue. My understanding is that they want to look at putting USAID underneath the State Department, which is not a novel concept--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "REP. MCCAUL: --Madeleine Albright talked about this under--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REP. MCCAUL: --you know, and Bill Clinton and Warren Christopher talked about this, even Joe Biden talked about this. I think putting it under State makes a lot of sense to me, to provide the direct supervision and oversight.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know how this department works, since you were the chair for so long, of the committee overseeing it. When this Trump-appointed judge put that federal- the pause on the putting USAID workers on leave, he wrote in the opinion, \"no future lawsuit could undo the physical harm that might result if USAID employees are not informed of imminent security threats occurring in the countries to which they've relocated in the course of their service to the United States.\" He's saying that the messy way this rolled out put people in physical risk when they are deployed by our government to countries over sea. Did the Secretary of State have any idea?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Secretary of State issued the waivers for PEPFAR and for humanitarian, both food and medicine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But people living and- and working, in places like Syria, aren't able to access computer systems and security warnings that are there.",
      "REP. MCCAUL: The- you know, every- every president that comes in does a review. I would argue, though, that since the Secretary has issued the waivers, it's incumbent upon his subordinates now to implement these waivers so that we don't see what could happen, where people are not getting their vaccines, they're not getting the HIV treatment, they're starving people in destabilized countries. And then we see China and Russia, and, quite frankly, Lindsey Graham and I did the Global Fragility Act to impact the Sahel in Africa. That is turning into a terror safe haven. You got Ebola popping up in Uganda. These are serious issues that, if we don't start implementing the waivers, you're going to see it get worse, not better, and I would urge the administration to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're striking a very different tone than- than Congressman Brian Mast who was here last week, and he said there's a grift on the American people. He said PEPFAR and Americans shouldn't fund AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa because their governments might work with China.",
      "REP. MCCAUL: It's the best--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a divide in your party about this right now.",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, it's the best- I can always speak to the program that President Bush started, and it was to save millions of lives. That is probably one of the- been the best goodwill missions the United States- and put the best face, no pun intended, on the nation, overseas, with our adversaries, countering them, with these people. We're saving their lives. The best global health program ever implemented by the United States was PEPFAR. I'd hate to see that go away. It will sunset once we achieve the mission. However, programs like that, when you look at the National Security importance of USAID, need to be maintained. And I go back to why it was implemented in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday night, the President ordered all foreign assistance to South Africa be halted and said, we should prioritize the resettling of Afrikaner refugees. These are white South Africans. That means they will get priority over everyone, it seems, because there's a suspension of refugee entry into the United States, including those Afghan allies who worked along the United- alongside the United States. Are you going to try to help lift that?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Yeah. I believe- you know, I did a comprehensive investigation that- the debacle of Afghanistan that the Biden administration was responsible for, including leaving our Afghan partners behind. Those--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should they get a carve out from the Trump ban on refugees? Should the Afghans?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: And I do believe that it was an unintended consequence that needs to be fixed. Look, we promised them we would protect them when they worked with our servicemen and women in Afghanistan. These are the interpreters, the ones who are right alongside our combat veterans. They have these special immigrant visas and P1, P2 and it's my- my view, that they should be allowed to go forward with the SIV program. And they have been vetted, by the way, Margaret, they have been vetted. Unlike some of the other groups they talked about, these have been vetted. They worked with our troops to defeat the Taliban, which unfortunately, Biden surrendered to. But it seems to me, we ought to live up to our word, otherwise down the road in another conflict, no one's going to trust us.",

You have spoken quite a bit this week about what USAID meant in your life, particularly when you were living in a refugee camp for four years, and USAID you talked about helping to keep you alive. We know this week, a federal judge will come to some kind of hearing and decision, perhaps, on what happens to all those government workers. Are the courts the main line of defense here?",
      "MINNESOTA REP. ILHAN OMAR: Yeah. I mean, what we are witnessing is a constitutional crisis. We are seeing an executive branch that has decided that they are no longer going to abide by the Constitution in honoring Congress' role in the creation of the agencies in their role in deciding where money is allocated, and so the only recourse we have since our congressional leadership, the speaker will not stop the executive is through the judiciary. And this is you know, when you think about the checks and balances that we have, the courts are the only recourse we have at the moment, and we have seen and when we talk about the illegality of what the executive is doing, we have seen every single executive order that has been challenged in the courts was found to be illegal. And that, I think, should give faith to the American people, that our courts are working as they should. The checks and balances are working. What is not working is the way that the executive is behaving and the congressional leadership that is failing the American people.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was interesting to hear Congressman McCaul indicate that when it came to breaking up an agency that was enshrined in law, that maybe there is some resistance there. Senator Hagerty, however, thought that Congress would be supportive of dismantling USAID after I read that- that description of the statute. It seems, though, that- that Democrats don't have a lot of leverage here to push this argument forward in Congress. Do you think you do?",
      "REP. OMAR: Well, they don't have the numbers in order to dismantle through Congress. That's why they are going through this illegal- that's why they're going through this illegal route. We know that USAID has support, not just with Democrats, but with Republicans. I can't see McCaul taking a vote to dismantle USAID, you know so- so we know that the votes are not there to dismantle the Department of Education. We know that the votes are not there to grant security clearances for them accessing treasury and so every single process that they are going through in implementing Trump's agenda is, at the moment, illegal, and they know they don't have the support for it in Congress. That's why they're not bringing it through Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's interesting that the first place to focus is such a small portion of federal spending to look at- at- at aid, but when you look at the popularity, Secretary Rubio was right in saying that it's getting harder to defend foreign aid because it's not popular. We saw the Chicago Council on Global Affairs surveyed American opinions on foreign policy, and they found a growing number want to reduce economic and military aid to other countries. So how do you convince the public that your point of view is the right one? Because it sounds like they're sliding the other way.",
      "REP. OMAR: Well, foreign aid, I think, throughout the history of our country, has not been popular with the American people because we don't have that many conversations about what it does, how much of it, it accounts for in our budget. A lot of people hear the millions, billions, and they don't fully have a concept of what that actually means, the lives it touches, and how important it is, both the soft power that we have as a country, how it keeps us competitive around the world, how it buys us goodwill. We can have the conversation, but when you just say foreign aid to a lot of people, they're thinking that we're sending bombs to other countries, which people like me and others oppose.",

      "Two of President Donald Trump's executive orders targeting the rights of transgender and nonbinary people face court challenges filed Friday.",
      "A group of transgender people sued in U.S. District Court in Boston over an order that led to the halting of allowing gender markers to be changed on passports and barring the use of the \"X\" marker used by many nonbinary people.",
      "The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, say the abrupt policy change last month did not comply with a requirement for a 60-day notice and comment period \u2014 and that it discriminates based on sex and, in some cases, transgender status.",
      "The order in question was one that Trump signed his first day back in office that said the government would recognize only people's sex and not their gender \u2014 and defined sex as unchangeable. That position is at odds with what the American Medical Association and other mainstream medical groups say.",
      "Also Friday, three Democratic states sued the Trump administration on over its order to ban federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender people under 19.",
      "Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown filed the federal lawsuit in the Western District of Washington. The attorneys general of Oregon and Minnesota, and three doctors, also joined as plaintiffs. The complaint argues that the order discriminates against transgender people.",
      "Trump signed an executive order last month directing federally run insurance programs, including Medicaid and TRICARE for military families, to exclude coverage for such care. It also calls on the Department of Justice to pursue litigation and legislation to oppose it.",
      "Medicaid programs in some states cover gender-affirming care. The new order suggests that the practice could end, and targets hospitals and universities that receive federal money and provide the care.",
      "\"That order poses an immediate threat to young people all across Washington state, and to the medical professionals in Washington who provide much-needed health care,\" Brown said at a news conference in Seattle.",
      "The complaint argues that the order violates equal rights protections, the separation of powers and states' powers to regulate what is not specifically delegated to the federal government.",
      "The development comes after families with transgender or nonbinary children filed a separate lawsuit in a Baltimore federal court earlier this week.",
      "While the legal fights go on, some providers have halted gender-affirming care for transgender young people while officials in New York have told hospitals that it would violate the law to stop the services.",
      "In addition to the orders on health care access and defining the sexes as unchangeable, Trump has also signed orders that open the door to banning transgender people from military service and set up new rules about how schools can teach about gender.",
      "Trump also signed an executive order on Wednesday intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday prevented the Trump administration from placing 2,200 employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, on administrative leave, siding with unions representing the employees for now.",
      "Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who President Trump named to the bench in 2019, said in a limited temporary restraining order issued late Friday night that was blocking the employees from being put on administrative leave, a move that was set to take effect at midnight.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday directed government officials to prioritize the resettlement of South Africans of European descent through the U.S. refugee program, which he suspended during his first day in office.",
      "In an executive order, Mr. Trump accused the South African government of discriminating against Afrikaners, an ethnic group in South Africa made up of descendants of European colonists, mostly from the Netherlands, who first arrived there in the 1600s.",
      "Until the 1990s, White South Africans of European descent ruled South Africa, enforcing the brutal system of apartheid against the country's Black majority.",

      "South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination, saying the law being scrutinized targets land not being used or not serving the public interest.",
      "In his order, Mr. Trump instructed Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to \"prioritize humanitarian relief, including admission and resettlement through the United States Refugee Admissions Program, for Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination.\"",
      "It's unclear how and when that plan would be enacted, since refugee arrivals were brought to a halt by Mr. Trump.",

      "The U.S. refugee program is designed to offer a safe haven to people abroad fleeing persecution based on their race, religion, political views or other factors. Typically, refugees are referred to the U.S. by United Nations officials and spend months or years in third countries undergoing interviews, as well as security and medical checks, before being allowed into the U.S.",

      "The former top government scientist during President Trump's first term in office has a cautionary tale to tell about the politicization of science. It involves Neil Jacobs, Mr. Trump's nominee to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "Jacobs, who led the agency on an acting basis during Mr. Trump's first term, was reprimanded for ethics violations in what became known as \"Sharpie-gate\" \u2014 when the president held up a hurricane forecast map with black marker appearing to extend the storm's potential path into Alabama.",
      "Craig McLean served during Mr. Trump's first term as acting chief scientist of NOAA, which monitors the health of the oceans and the warming of the climate, and runs the National Weather Service, which issues weather warnings. In his first interview, McLean told CBS News many scientists \"are worried about President Donald Trump's return to office \u2014 after he undermined science in his first term.\"",
      "\"Folks realize that they may be in for a storm,\" said McLean.",

      "It wasn't.",
      "Twenty minutes later, the National Weather Service in Alabama accurately tweeted, \"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.\"",

      "\"To have a political process unplug the public's trust, that got me stirred,\" McLean said. \"That gave me a sense of rage.\"",
      "McLean demanded investigations. According to a report by a panel of the National Academy of Public Administration for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General report about the incident, the investigations concluded that the statement backing Mr. Trump was \"driven by external political pressure,\" through a \"request from the White House then-Acting Chief of Staff,\" and that Jacobs, the head of NOAA who has been nominated again, \"violated the Code of Ethics for Science Supervision and Management set forth in Section 7.01 of NOAA's Scientific Integrity Policy when they failed to engage the Birmingham WFO in the development of the September 6 Statement.\"",
      "The National Academy report said: \"Further, the Panel finds that they engaged in misconduct intentionally, knowingly, or in reckless disregard of the Code of Scientific Conduct or Code of Ethics for Science Supervision and Management in NOAA's Scientific Integrity Policy.\"",
      "According to the inspector general report, Jacobs felt pressured.",
      "\"In Dr. Jacobs's view, he could make the statement more accurate, but the Department would issue, or would cause NOAA to issue, a statement one way or another,\" the report said. \"If he resigned or were fired, he reasoned, the final statement likely would have been worse and more inflammatory.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to Jacobs for comment, but has not yet received a response. A spokesperson for NOAA said it does not comment on nominations and has no contact with nominees until they are confirmed.",
      "McLean requested NOAA's top leaders acknowledge the investigative findings. Shortly after, he was relieved of his position. McLean stayed on with NOAA, in another position, and eventually retired.",
      "McLean has a stark message about hurricane warnings.",
      "\"People's lives are on the line,\" McLean said.",
      "But NOAA's science is about more than hurricane warnings. It underpins how corporations and insurance companies predict the ever-growing risks of climate disasters and helps farmers choose the best time to plant as weather patterns shift.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration, in a letter Thursday, directed states to stop spending money for EV charging infrastructure \u2014 funds that had been allocated under former President Joe Biden. President Trump has slammed federal funding for electric vehicle chargers as \"an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "But the administration may need an act of Congress to freeze the states' spending, and it's not clear there will be one. Industry leaders say customer demand will continue to drive growth in the charging network, regardless of federal funding.",
      "The Tesla Supercharger network \u2014 led by CEO Elon Musk, now leading Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 has received millions of dollars through the program that was just halted. But it also has a massive footprint of chargers across the country. Tesla will continue expanding its network regardless of federal money and is likely to benefit from its competitors receiving fewer funds.",
      "Trump and EV charging",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump paused billions in funding for a nationwide buildout of fast electric car chargers that had been allocated to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula program.",
      "Then the Federal Highway Administration, the Transportation Department agency that administers NEVI funding, told states Thursday to stop carrying out their plans, pending new guidelines. It's part of the broader effort to dismantle many environmental policies and incentives put in place by the Biden administration.",
      "Some states, like Alabama and Rhode Island, had already suspended their programs in response to the Inauguration Day order, but Thursday's directive is a further push from the Trump administration to halt federal efforts to electrify the roads and reduce planet-warming emissions from transportation.",
      "States that currently have NEVI-funded projects up and running mostly have been reimbursed by the federal government. But the new memo means states with projects in the works, or those currently contracting for them, are to be halted immediately, and they don't know if or when they will be able to proceed and request reimbursement.",
      "Impact on EV drivers in the U.S.",
      "NEVI was created through the Biden administration's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed by Congress in 2021, to fill gaps in the EV charging infrastructure network. It addresses the concern many car buyers have for road trips where charging stations are too far apart.",
      "The NEVI program awards states $5 billion over five years, but they've struggled with permitting delays, complicated electrical upgrades and contracting.",
      "Estimates suggest $3.3 billion of NEVI funding had already gone out the door to states.",

      "This announcement creates uncertainty, said Ryan Gallentine, managing director at business association Advanced Energy United.",
      "\"Most of the unawarded money is sitting in state Department of Transportation bank accounts ready to be spent,\" Gallentine said in a statement. States are under no obligation to stop these projects based solely on this announcement, he said. \"We call on state DOTs and program administrators to continue executing this program until new guidance is finalized.\"",
      "Others say the effort is sure to trigger legal battles.",
      "The administration has \"no legal basis\" for stopping plans that have already been approved and funded, said Andrew Wishnia, former deputy assistant secretary for climate policy at the DOT who helped author the NEVI program.",
      "Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, a company that tracks EV charging data, predicted EV range concerns will linger for drivers. \"If you don't have convenient access either where you live or where you work or in between, why would you get an EV? It just doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "Money that was leftover after states met their highway obligations was meant to fill other gaps in charging: areas where there are low rates of EVs, including low-income areas or areas with a lot of apartment buildings where it hard for people to charge.",
      "The road ahead for U.S. highway EV charging",
      "The federal buildout is not the only effort to build EV charging across the nation. Private companies have collectively spent billions on this infrastructure.",
      "EV industry executives say that the demand from drivers for EV chargers will propel companies to build more of them. \"I think the trend will continue. Maybe it'll slow down over the next four years \u2026 but it's going to continue,\" said Bassem Ammouri, the chief operating officer at EV Connect, a major EV charging platform.",

    "story": [
      "Trump administration political appointees have taken steps in recent weeks to exert unprecedented influence over the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's flagship medical research publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News. The interference included dictating what to cover and withholding studies on the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "The Trump administration's moves to control the research published by the agency ends a decades-long streak of independence for the journal, known as the MMWR.",
      "Health officials and experts have long considered the MMWR as the \"voice of CDC\" and a respected source where federal scientists release research of public health importance. It ranks as among the most-cited health journals in the world.",
      "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
      "Efforts by Trump officials to control the publication have stalled the release of three studies about bird flu for weeks, as the virus continues spreading through wild birds, poultry farms and cows around the country.",
      "That delay was initially attributed to the communications \"pause\" ordered by the Department of Health and Human Services, which stalled many releases across the government.",
      "Spokespeople for the CDC and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump officials initially said the gag order was needed for the administration to catch up in staffing its public relations team to oversee the vast amount of communications coming out of the nations' federal health agencies.",
      "But as that pause has started to lift, Trump officials at HHS, and acting CDC Director Susan Monarez, refused repeated requests by career health officials to publish the completed research, officials say.",
      "The stalled research includes findings about pet cats owned by dairy workers being infected with bird flu, plus wastewater testing results and antibody testing of cow veterinarians.",
      "Instead, health officials say Monarez relayed orders by the Trump administration to come up with research to publish this week about the health risks from wildfires, days after President Trump criticized California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's handling of fires in the state.",
      "Federal scientists say they scrambled to find studies to comply with the order, which was unexpected and not related to any studies that had been scheduled to come out.",
      "The research that was ultimately published looked at exposure to worrying chemicals for firefighters who responded to the 2023 wildfires in Hawaii and emergency room visits in Los Angeles during the wildfires.",
      "Multiple health officials said they complied fearing their jobs. Scientists within the agency say they have been bombarded with daily requests to accept the \"fork in the road\" offer to resign by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,\u00a0task force, headed by Elon Musk.",
      "Glimpse at a study taken offline",
      "A technical glitch resulted in a table from one of the bird flu studies accidentally being published on Thursday, before officials scrambled to take it down.",
      "That bird flu study was supposed to lay out the details of an investigation into how two indoor cats could have contracted the virus. One of the cats' owners was a dairy worker who transported unpasteurized raw milk, which health officials warn is one of the main ways that H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading between farms in the U.S.",
      "Multiple federal health officials and outside experts have unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to allow the publication to maintain its independence, citing the importance of allowing federal public health researchers to publish their findings without fearing political interference.",
      "While researchers often have to jump through multiple hoops of \"clearance\" within the agency to satisfy questions and concerns raised by scientists and career health officials about the accuracy of their research, officials said political appointees usually steered clear of meddling in its content.",
      "Now health officials fear that a precedent has been set for the Trump administration to cross further lines in its attempts to influence the research and data published by the CDC.",
      "Previous efforts by Trump-appointed officials to exert control over the publication came under scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Mr. Trump's first term, after aides sought to influence reports at the time.",
      "It is now unclear to co-authors of the bird flu research outside the agency when the research will ever be published, weeks after it was ready to go.",

Musk and his team at the Department of Government Efficiency task force have been making sweeping changes and forcing cuts at government agencies one by one \u2014 to praise from President Trump's supporters and protest from others.",
      "\"As an unpaid special government employee who is not a commissioned officer, Elon will file a confidential financial disclosure report,\" the White House official said. \"He was also provided an ethics briefing this week and other DOGE staff will/have received the same treatment.\"",
      "The highest-level government officials, including Cabinet nominees, top White House officials and so-designated special government employees are required by the Ethics in Government Act to file financial disclosures and oftentimes, ethics agreements, documents meant to shed light on any potential conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of them.",
      "Filers are required to disclose all significant assets, including investments like mutual funds and stocks, as well as income and debt, and foreign investments. The financial disclosure for FBI director nominee Kash Patel, for instance, revealed he was consulting for the Embassy of Qatar as recently as November, the same month Mr. Trump tapped him to head up the FBI.",
      "Special government employees \u2014 the designation the Trump administration has given Musk as a temporary employee \u2014 must file a financial disclosure as long as they work for the federal government for at least 60 days. According to the Office of Government Ethics, which keeps records of these filings and offers guidance to filers, special government employees that are \"paid under a system other than the general schedule\" and \"have a rate of basic pay equal to or greater than 120% of the minimum rate of basic pay for GS-15\" are required to file public disclosures, giving the administration a possible but murky loophole, since Musk isn't accepting a government salary.",
      "Musk's businesses include SpaceX, Tesla, X, formerly known as Twitter, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and xAI, some of which do business with foreign countries. Tesla, for instance, does business in China. Musk's net worth is just shy of $400 billion as of this month, according to Forbes.",
      "That Musk's financial interests won't be disclosed is a concern, good government nonprofits say, because it's hard to discern whether any actions he takes or promotes benefit him personally.",
      "\"While filing a confidential disclosure may be correct legally, it is not what is appropriate here. With the level of influence over the federal government that Musk appears to have, the American public has a right to know what his business interests and potential conflicts of interest are,\" said Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. \"He has spoken in the past of a need for a more transparent government. We agree. This isn't that.\"",
      "In December, Musk took to his platform, X, to say he doesn't believe Americans should have to file Freedom of Information Act requests because such information should already be public.",
      "\"There should be no need for FOIA requests,\" Musk wrote. \"All government data should be default public for maximum transparency.\"",
      "Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, said it's \"concerning that the White House isn't saying we have nothing to hide and Musk's financial disclosure report will be released.\"",
      "\"The public and agencies deserve a full understanding of Musk's financial interests in order to prevent conflicts when he storms into agencies,\" Amey said. \"Just because he is unpaid does not mean he won't have significant influence in this administration, and be involved in decisions that touch on his personal and private interests, including federal contracts and regulatory issues.\"",
      "The White House official who confirmed Musk's financial disclosure will be confidential also said Musk has a \"TS\" clearance, meaning top secret, the highest level of access to information apart from \"TS/SCI,\" which means top clearance for sensitive compartmentalized information.",
      "In a press conference Friday, a reporter asked Mr. Trump why DOGE needs access to Americans' personal information, like bank accounts and Social Security numbers. Consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns about DOGE gaining access to the Treasury Department's payment system, and taxpayers' Social Security numbers.",

      "The White House has not yet responded for comment on Weintraub's post or firing.",
      "The FEC is charged with enforcing campaign finance laws and overseeing federal elections. It has an unusual composition \u2014 the commission can be composed of no more than three Republicans and three Democrats. A majority of commissioners must agree to any action, and the even partisan division on the commission frequently leads to gridlock on matters of significance. There's currently one vacant Republican position.",
      "Weintraub's six-year term expired in April 2007, but according to FEC rules, that didn't mean she had to leave the commission.",
      "\"Commissioners serving expired terms may choose to remain until they are replaced,\" FEC rules state. The president appoints FEC commissioners, who must then be confirmed by the Senate. However, there is no written provision or language that limits if a president can replace an FEC commissioner before a replacement is appointed.",

      "She said she received the letter, dated Jan. 31, 2025, in an email on Thursday from the White House's Office of Presidential Personnel. Weintraub wasn't aware of whether her fellow Democratic commissioners received a similar letter.",
      "She said she is still mulling over her options on what to do next, and whether or not to file litigation.",
      "\"This is unprecedented. It wasn't contemplated. The statute has a clearly laid out task for replacing commissioners and this wasn't it,\" she told CBS News. \"There has never been a firing. There is nothing in the statute, in the Federal Election Campaign act that authorizes a firing.\"",
      "\"It raises concerns about political actors interfering with the operations of the agency that is supposed to be regulating political actors,\" she added.",
      "The Campaign Legal Center, a legal nonprofit group that deals with voting issues, campaign finance and ethics,\u00a0released a statement\u00a0calling the president's firing of Weintraub illegal.",
      "Trevor Potter, its president and the Republican former chair of the FEC, says Trump's move to fire her without a Senate-confirmed replacement is illegal.",
      "\"As the only agency that regulates the president, Congress intentionally did not grant the president the power to fire FEC commissioners,\" wrote Trevor Potter, the founder and president of the CLC and a Republican former chair of the FEC. \"Trump is free to nominate multiple new commissioners and to allow Congress to perform its constitutional role of advice and consent. It's contrary to law that he has instead opted to claim to 'fire' a single Democratic commissioner who has been an outspoken critic of the president's lawbreaking and of the FEC's failure to hold him accountable.\"",
      "Weintraub is not the only member of an independent commission to be be fired by Mr.\u00a0Trump. Last month the president fired\u00a0Gwynne Wilcox\u00a0from the National Labor Relations Board. On Wednesday, she filed a lawsuit over her dismissal. Her case could determine precedent for the president's use of executive power to remove officials in independent agencies. In an interview, she told CBS News, \"There [wasn't] any cause or any reason that I was actually terminated.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 17:32:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's list of tax priorities includes eliminating a loophole that benefits private equity firms, hedge funds and other big investors.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is proposing to eliminate a tax loophole that's also a long-time target of some Democratic lawmakers.",
      "Mr. Trump is working on \"no tax on seniors' Social Security, no tax on overtime pay\" as well as renewing the tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Jan. 6. But, she added, the president also wants to abolish the \"carried interest tax deduction loophole.\"",
      "The latter tax break might not be well-known to many Americans given that it's predominantly used by hedge funds, private equity firms and other types of investment funds. That loophole allows investment managers to greatly lower their taxable income, a major perk for investors whose annual earnings can mount into the billions.",
      "Carried interest refers to the income that investment managers collect from their funds, which is typically 20% of profits. Under current tax law, that income is taxed as a capital gain, which has a top tax rate of 20% for long-term gains, versus the highest rate of 37% for regular income, such as the money that workers receive in their paychecks.",
      "\"The carried interest tax loophole is one of the clearest examples of our two-tiered tax system,\" said David Kass, executive director of the tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Average Americans can't cut their tax burden in half for no reason, but the wealthy and well-connected can.\"",
      "Aligned with Democrats",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal to remove the carried interest deduction aligns him with the aims of Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have long sought to eliminate the loophole. Most recently, Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, and 13 other lawmakers on Thursday\u00a0introduced the Carried Interest Fairness Act, which would boost the tax rate on investment funds' carried interest to the same rates paid by workers on their income.",
      "Eliminating the Wall Street tax break could help boost tax revenue by about $100 billion over the next decade, according to a new analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), an advocacy group focused on fiscal matters. That would only partly offset the wide-ranging tax cuts Mr. Trump is proposing, which the CRFB estimates will cost almost $5 trillion over the next 10 years.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal is getting pushback from Wall Street, with the trade group American Investment Council urging the new administration to preserve the tax break.",
      "\"We encourage the Trump Administration and Congress to keep this sound tax policy in place and unleash more long-term investment that supports jobs, workers, small businesses, and local communities,\" said Drew Maloney, CEO of the American Investment Council, in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The private equity industry has invested more than $5.6 trillion in the U.S. economy since Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, Maloney noted.",
      "Ending the loophole would put investment managers on the same tax footing as middle-class workers, Kass of the Americans for Tax Fairness said",
      "\"The time for repeal is long overdue,\" Kass said. \"We can't allow loopholes like this to persist as income and wealth inequality continues to intensify.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans are moving forward with their own budget plan to fund President Trump's agenda despite a request from House Speaker Mike Johnson to hold off and let the lower chamber take the lead.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, released a 61-page budget resolution on Friday, setting the groundwork for the Senate to later pass a budget reconciliation bill focused on border security, defense and energy priorities.",
      "\"This budget resolution jumpstarts a process that will give President Trump's team the money they need to secure the border and deport criminals, and make America strong and more energy independent,\" Graham, who leads the Senate Budget Committee, said in a statement.",
      "The resolution would direct the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland Security Committee to each propose $175 billion in additional spending. The Armed Services Committee could propose $150 billion in new spending, while the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee would be allotted $20 billion and the Environment and Public Works Committee $1 billion.",
      "Several other committees would be instructed to find at least $1 billion in cuts.",
      "According to Graham, the resolution would increase annual spending by $85.5 billion, which would be paid for by the same amount in spending cuts.",
      "Graham announced that his committee will meet Wednesday and Thursday to debate and vote on the resolution, which sets a March 7 deadline for the committees to make their proposals.",
      "\"Senate Republicans are ready to roll,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota wrote.",
      "Under the budget reconciliation process, Senate Republicans can avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the upper chamber and pass the bill without any Democratic support.",
      "Graham unveiled the plan ahead of Senate Republicans' dinner with Mr. Trump on Friday night at Mar-a-Lago and a day after House Republicans spent hours at the White House trying to pull together their own framework.",
      "House Republicans have been at odds with their Senate colleagues, preferring to pass one major bill that also includes extending tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term and potentially a debt ceiling suspension.

    "summary": "A group of anonymous FBI agents sued the Justice Department to prevent the public release of names of bureau personnel who worked on Jan. 6 cases.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department said the federal government would not publicly release the names of FBI agents who worked on the now-closed investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, according to a court order filed Friday.",
      "The Justice Department and a group of unnamed FBI agents reached an agreement\u00a0in which the government said it would not disclose a list of the agents' names that was compiled by the FBI and transmitted to the Justice Department on Tuesday unless there is two days' notice given to the agents.",
      "The two sides agreed to the order following a hearing Thursday as part of two cases filed by anonymous FBI agents and the FBI Agents Association earlier this week that sought to preemptively stop the Justice Department from publicizing the list of agents.",
      "Natalie Bara, president of the FBI Agents Association, said the group welcomes the order, which allows them to return to court and challenge any planned disclosure of the agents' and employees' names.",
      "\"This is an important step in the right direction to protect those who protect us \u2014 FBI agents who have dedicated their careers to upholding the rule of law and defending our country,\" she said in a statement. \"This agreement provides critical safeguards, preventing immediate public exposure or retaliation and ensuring that FBI Agents can remain focused on protecting the American people. We appreciate the court's recognition of the serious concerns at stake.\"",
      "President Trump told reporters at the White House that he is not planning to fire all FBI employees who worked on the Jan. 6 investigations, but would terminate \"some\" because, he said, they were \"corrupt.\"",
      "\"I got to know a lot about that business, that world. I got to know a lot about that world, and we had some corrupt agents, and those people are gone, or they will be gone, and it will be done quickly and very surgically,\" he said.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who is overseeing the pair of cases, issued a brief administrative stay that prevented the Justice Department from disclosing the list to anyone outside the department while negotiations between lawyers for the FBI agents and the department continued overnight.",
      "They were set to reconvene to continue the hearing Friday, but it was called off given the deal. The Justice Department and FBI agents agreed to file their briefs about a more permanent injunction later this month and into March, and Cobb set a hearing for March 27.",
      "Last week, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned \"at any time\" to a Jan. 6 investigation \"to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News. In response, agents across the country were asked Sunday to complete questionnaires about their involvement in the Jan. 6 and Trump probes as part of a Justice Department evaluation of the workforce.",
      "Initially, the FBI handed over employee identification numbers and other identifying information for over 5,000 personnel who responded to the survey. However, sources confirmed to CBS News that Driscoll was later ordered to submit the actual names of the FBI employees who investigated Jan. 6 cases. In a message to FBI employees, Driscoll wrote he had complied with the orders and the names were sent via a classified system, sources said.",
      "The Justice Department confirmed in the latest court filing that it informed lawyers for the FBI agents that brought the lawsuits that a record pairing the employee identification numbers on the list with the corresponding names of FBI personnel had been given to the Justice Department.",
      "In a separate memo obtained by CBS News, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told FBI employees that agents who followed orders and carried out their duties throughout the Jan. 6 probes in an \"ethical manner\" would not be subject to any disciplinary action. Bove also revealed acting FBI leadership refused to comply with initial efforts to identify certain agents tied to the probes in what he called instances of \"insubordination.\"",
      "It remains unclear what personnel action, if any, Justice Department leaders might take based on the list of names. Lawyers for the FBI agents involved in the lawsuit have warned that the purpose of the list is to identify agents for \"adverse employment action\" as a result of their work on the Jan. 6 probes.",
      "Roughly a dozen Justice Department employees who worked on former special counsel Jack Smith's investigation and prosecutions of Mr. Trump \u2014 which were dismissed after he was elected in November \u2014 were fired, sources confirmed to CBS News last month. A Justice Department official said they were terminated because then-Acting Attorney General James McHenry \"did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president.\"",
      "And a separate group of federal prosecutors inside the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., who were hired on an interim basis to work on the Capitol attack probes were also let go, according to a letter reviewed by CBS News last week.",
      "The personnel moves come amid leadership changes within the Justice Department. Attorney General Pam Bondi was sworn in on Wednesday after the Senate approved her nomination for the top job. The FBI is operating under acting leadership as Mr. Trump's nominee to serve as director, Kash Patel, awaits confirmation. His nomination was set to advance to a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, but Democrats sought a week delay for further consideration.",
      "Lawyers for the FBI agents had warned that if the identities of bureau personnel who worked on the Jan. 6 cases were to be made public, it would put them and their families at risk. They noted during the hearing Thursday that since the start of Mr. Trump's second term, the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has already publicized the names of federal employees.",
      "Some people who received pardons from Mr. Trump for crimes committed on Jan. 6 have also taken to social media to threaten to target FBI workers.",

    "story": [
      "Cambridge, England \u2014 Scientists have long said cutting methane emissions is key to addressing climate change, but many big industries aren't readily able to curb their production of the harmful greenhouse gas. A British company says it has an answer: Turn methane into something else.",
      "Methane is a menace. Climate scientists say the invisible gas warms the Earth's atmosphere 84 times faster than carbon dioxide. It's released into the atmosphere by organic material, such as food waste, rotting at landfill sites, sewage treatment facilities and by the digestive systems of cows.",
      "Levidian \u2014 a climate tech business in Cambridge, England \u2014 set out to tackle this climate change challenge, by giving methane a makeover.",
      "\"The magic happens in here,\" the company's CEO John Hartley told CBS News as he led our team on a guided tour of Levidian's patented LOOP system \u2014 a machine with a giant metal hopper shaped like a balloon.",
      "The technology uses microwave energy and a special nozzle system to split methane molecules into the gas' component parts \u2014 hydrogen and carbon \u2014 and captures them.",
      "Hydrogen is increasingly sought after, as it can be used to power factories, trucks, ships and other machinery. Levidian said it's a clean fuel, because, when burned, it yields heat and energy, but the only emission is water vapor, no carbon dioxide.",
      "The carbon from the broken-down methane, meanwhile, falls into the hopper as a solid called graphene, which has been known to science for only about two decades and which is often touted as the strongest material in the world.",
      "Dr. Ellie Galanis, head of commercial development at Levidian, was keen to show off a harvest of graphene from the LOOP hopper at the company's lab.",
      "\"It's such an exciting time to be involved in graphene,\" said the self-described \"graphene geek,\" shaking a cube filled with black, powder-like material. \"It's awesome.\"",

      "\"When surgeons do the 'snap test,' they're trying to check if it will break, and that doesn't happen when you add graphene in \u2014 it makes them much stronger and more puncture resistant,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Scientists say graphene also helps boost battery life in electric vehicles, and it can be mixed into plastic to help manufactures use less petroleum-derived materials in their bottles.",
      "Researchers only discovered graphene 20 years ago, at the University of Manchester, and Levidian sees years of growth ahead for the product.",
      "\"When you get in your car, you will have graphene enhanced tires that last longer. The battery in that car, if it's electric, will take you further because it will have more capacity to charge faster, and the concrete you use in the building you go into will be more durable and have a smaller carbon footprint,\" she predicted, adding that even \"the clothes that you wear might have graphene in them so they're more sustainable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January, despite an abnormally chilly United States, a cooling La Nina and predictions of a slightly less hot 2025, according to the European climate service Copernicus.",
      "The surprising January heat record coincides with a new study by a climate science heavyweight, former top NASA scientist James Hansen, and others arguing that global warming is accelerating. It's a claim that's dividing the research community.",
      "January 2025 globally was 0.09 degrees Celsius (0.16 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than January 2024, the previous hottest January, and was 1.75 C (3.15 F) warmer than it was before industrial times, Copernicus calculated. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Scientists won't regard the limit as breached unless and until global temperatures stay above it for 20 years.",
      "Copernicus records date to 1940, but other U.S. and British records go back to 1850, and scientists using proxies such as tree rings say this era is the warmest in about 120,000 years \u2014 or since the start of human civilization.",
      "By far the biggest driver of record heat is greenhouse gas buildup from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, but the natural contributions to temperature change have not been acting quite as expected, said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate for the European weather agency.",
      "The big natural factor in global temperatures is usually the natural cycle of changes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean waters. When the central Pacific is especially warm, it's an El Nino and global temperatures tend to spike. Last year was a substantial El Nino, though it ended last June and the year was even warmer than initially expected, the hottest on record.",
      "El Nino's cooler flip side, a La Nina, tends to dampen the effects of global warming, making record temperatures far less likely. A La Nina started in January after brewing for months. Just last month, climate scientists were predicting that 2025 wouldn't be as hot as 2024 or 2023, with the La Nina a major reason.",
      "\"Even though the equatorial Pacific isn't creating conditions that are warming for our global climate, we're still seeing record temperatures,\" Burgess said, adding much of that is because of record warmth in the rest of the world's oceans.",
      "Usually after an El Nino like last year, temperatures fall rapidly, but \"we've not seen that,\" Burgess told The Associated Press.",
      "For Americans, news of a record warm January might seem odd given how cold it was. But the U.S. is just a tiny fraction of the planet's surface, and \"a much larger area of the planet's surface was much, much warmer than average,\" Burgess said.",
      "January was unseasonably mild in the Arctic. Parts of the Canadian Arctic had temperatures 54 degrees Fahrneheit warmer than average and temperatures got so warm sea ice started melting in places, Burgess said.",
      "Copernicus said the Arctic this month tied the January record for lowest sea ice. The U.S.-based National Snow and Ice Data Center had it as second-lowest, behind 2018.",
      "February has already started cooler than last year, Burgess said.",
      "But don't count 2025 out in the race for hottest year, said Hansen, the former NASA scientist who has been called the godfather of climate science. He's now at Columbia University.",
      "In a study in the journal Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Hansen and colleagues said the last 15 years have warmed at about twice the rate of the previous 40 years.",
      "\"I'm confident that this higher rate will continue for at least several years,\" Hansen told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Over the full year, it's going to be nip-and-tuck between 2024 and 2025.\"",
      "There's been a noticeable temperature rise even when taking out El Nino variations and expected climate change since 2020, Hansen said. He noted recent shipping regulations that have resulted in reduced sulfur pollution, which reflects some sunlight away from Earth and effectively reduces warming. And that will continue, he said.",
      "\"The persistence of record warmth through 2023, 2024 and now into the first month of 2025 is jarring to say the least,\" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the Hansen study. \"There seems little doubt that global warming and the impacts of climate change are accelerating.\"",
      "But Princeton's Gabe Vecchi and University of Pennsylvania's Michael Mann said they don't agree with Hansen on acceleration. Vecchi said there's not enough data to show that this isn't random chance. Mann said temperature increases are still within what climate models forecast.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The Herculaneum scrolls have remained one of the many tantalizing mysteries of the ancient world for almost 2,000 years. Burnt to a crisp by lava from Mount Vesuvius in A.D.  79, the reams of rolled-up papyrus were discovered in a mansion in Herculaneum \u2014 an ancient Roman town near Pompeii \u2014 in the mid-18th century. Both towns were decimated by the Vesuvius eruption, and most of the scrolls were so badly charred they were impossible to open.",
      "Over the next two and a half centuries, attempts were made to unfurl some of the hundreds of scrolls using everything from rose water and mercury to vegetable gas and papyrus juice, according to the New Yorker.",
      "The few that could be opened were philosophical texts written in ancient Greek. But most of the scrolls were so badly damaged, they were considered illegible. More recently, researchers managed to decipher some select words using artificial intelligence, X-ray and CT scans to distinguish ink from the papyrus it was printed on.",
      "The mystery is still unravelling, and on Wednesday, a major breakthrough was announced. Researchers say they've now managed to digitally unroll and start reading one of the ancient scrolls. The scroll in question, known as PHerc. 172, is one of three stored at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Libraries in England.",
      "A team involved in the Vesuvius Challenge, a competition offering prize money to anyone who can help unlock the delicate scrolls, says it has virtually unwrapped the papyrus to reveal columns of text that Oxford scholars have already started working to decipher.",
      "\"This scroll contains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll,\" said Brent Seales, one of the co-founders of the challenge.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" project lead Stephen Parsons told CBS News' partner network BBC News. \"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "The breakthrough came when the team at the Bodleian Libraries brought the blackened scroll to the Diamond Light Source research facility in nearby Oxfordshire, where technicians used a massive machine called a synchrotron to create a powerful X-ray beam that was able to peer into the fragile relic without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimeter,\" Adrian Mancuso,  the facility's director of physical sciences, told the BBC. \"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally.\"",

      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published Monday in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",
      "As for the higher levels found in the brains of dementia patients, the researchers noted the study was not designed to prove whether that was the cause of symptoms \u2014 it may be the reverse, that the disease process allows more accumulation to happen.",
      "\"Atrophy of brain tissue, impaired blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and poor clearance mechanisms are hallmarks of dementia and would be anticipated to increase [micro- and nanoplastic] concentrations,\" they wrote.",

    "title": "NASA astronaut says \"we don't feel abandoned\" as space mission stretches on",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:00:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Starliner astronaut Sunita Williams says she and crewmate Butch Wilmore have not been \"abandoned\" in space, as NASA considers plans to speed their return.",
    "story": [
      "Contrary to a recent social media post from President Trump, Starliner astronaut Sunita Williams says she and crewmate Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore have not been \"virtually abandoned\" in space, despite a mission that's been extended from a little more than one week to more than nine months.",
      "\"I don't think I'm abandoned. I don't think we're stuck up here,\" she  told CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson during an in-flight  interview airing Friday night. \"We've got food. We've got  clothes. We have a ride home in case anything really bad does happen to  the International Space Station.",
      "\"We're in a posture ... where we  have the International Space Station fully manned and doing what the  taxpayers wanted, to do world-class science. And so I feel honored, like  I said, to be here and a part of the team.\"",
      "NASA is finalizing plans to bring Williams and Wilmore back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, around March 19, sources say. That would shorten their extended stay in orbit by about two weeks compared to a previous plan for late March or April.",
      "The slightly earlier trip home would be possible if the next set of station fliers, known as Crew 10, is switched to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as mid March. The switch is needed, sources say, because work to prepare the original SpaceX ferry ship for its maiden flight is taking longer than expected.",
      "In any case, after a weeklong handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams would undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the same Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams' return.",
      "Why the mission extended for months",
      "Assuming the dates hold up \u2014 and there are multiple variables in play \u2014 Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since their\u00a0launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week, the time needed to carry out the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.",
      "But the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and helium leaks shortly after launch that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could hitch a ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA initially planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but last December, another month was tacked onto the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch. Sources now say more time is needed to finish that work.",
      "Trump speaks out on crew's delay",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, saying in a social media post that he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\" He also named Musk, a billionaire\u00a0supporter of the Trump campaign, to head the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is charged with cutting the size of the federal government.",
      "Musk said in an earlier post\u00a0on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "NASA's administrator at the time, Bill Nelson, was appointed by the Biden administration, but the decision to extend the Starliner crew's mission was made by the agency's Commercial Crew and International Space Station programs. The plan has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 Dragon was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "As such, there is no need to \"go get\" the astronauts \u2014 their ride home has been docked at the space station for the past five months.",
      "\"We don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team.\"",
      "In the interview, Dickerson asked Williams about the president's comments on their mission.",
      "\"Trump said you and Butch Wilmore, who is your Starliner crewmate, had been \u2014 this is the president's words \u2014 'virtually abandoned,'\" Dickerson asked. \"Do you feel abandoned up there, commander?\"",
      "\"I don't think those words are quite accurate,\" Williams replied. \"Both Butch and I have lived up here on the space station before. We know how NASA and our commercial partners work together. So we expected that we would be up here for a little while.",
      "\"We're part of something bigger than ourselves. We're part of the International Space Station, and we have obligations to our international partners to do science and exploration while we're up here. So yeah, we knew this was going to happen, so no, we don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team, and that's a huge honor.\"",
      "Asked why the Crew 9 Dragon couldn't return to Earth sooner, given that it's already docked at the station, Williams said that would leave the station with a single U.S. crew member aboard, Don Pettit, who was launched to the station last year with two cosmonauts aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "With only a single U.S. astronaut aboard to respond to emergencies, operate power, life support and other systems in the NASA segment of the station, high-priority research would grind to a halt. Standard practice is for NASA to launch a replacement crew about a week before the outgoing crew's departure for an orderly handover.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams said. \"And the space station is big, it's a building, it's the size of a football field.",
      "\"Things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside (or) outside, and so having additional people to be able to do that, that capability, is really important.\"",
      "NASA has tentatively decided to switch the Crew 10 fliers \u2014 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon to avoid adding even more time to Crew 9's already extended mission.",
      "Crew 10 is expected to be assigned to a Crew Dragon that had been earmarked for a commercial flight to the station, a mission known as AX-4 that was booked by Houston-based Axiom Space. That non-NASA crew would instead use the original Crew 10 Dragon later this spring.",
      "NASA would not comment on the plans. A spokeswoman said \"we're not able to confirm any details reported on Crew 9 return at this time. We are working through coordination of forward plans for the agency's Commercial Crew Program missions with its various stakeholders. We will share more information as soon as we can.\"",
      "For her part, Williams said she just wanted \"the right decision to be made, in the best interest of all of us, of Crew 10, of course, and us. I'm happy either way. Eight days turned into a couple more months than that, a couple more months, whatever, it doesn't really matter. The right decision just has to be made.\"",

    "summary": "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said.",
    "story": [
      "A colossal explosion in the sky, unleashing energy hundreds of times greater than the Hiroshima bomb. A blinding flash nearly as bright as the sun. Shockwaves powerful enough to flatten everything for miles.",
      "It may sound apocalyptic, but a newly detected asteroid nearly the size of a football field now has a greater than one percent chance of colliding with Earth in about eight years.",
      "Such an impact has the potential for city-level devastation, depending on where it strikes. CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Scientists aren't panicking yet, but they are watching closely.",
      "\"At this point, it's 'Let's pay a lot of attention, let's get as many assets as we can observing it,'\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told the AFP news agency.",
      "What we know about 2024 YR4 and its chances of hitting Earth",
      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at US space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 1.6% chance the asteroid will strike Earth on December 22, 2032.",
      "The asteroid 2024 YR4 is now rated at Level 3 out of 10 on the\u00a0Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is \"a close encounter\" that warrants attention from astronomers and the public.",
      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth, and its next close pass will not come until 2028. Scientists will be able to get another look at the asteroid then, Harwood said, and determine its orbit and trajectory.",
      "Betts said, \"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero.\"",
      "A similar scenario unfolded in 2004 with Apophis, an asteroid initially projected to have a 2.7 percent chance of striking Earth in 2029. Further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",
      "If all else fails, the long warning time means authorities could evacuate the impact zone.",
      "\"Nobody should be scared about this,\" said Fast. \"We can find these things, make these predictions and have the ability to plan.\"",

      "Space debris plummeting back to Earth could be a growing problem for aircraft, researchers warned in a new study.",
      "The study authors, all affiliated with Canada's University of British Columbia, said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights. The study focused on rocket bodies, which pose a greater risk because of their size.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was published in Scientific Reports. The study builds on work by the authors presented at the annual International Orbital Debris Conference.",
      "Space debris and risks to airplanes",
      "The study authors worked to determine the odds of a rocket body reentering in an airspace. They found that high-density regions immediately around major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern United States or around major cities Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "The odds of debris striking an aircraft is small, the study authors said, but a collision between a commercial plane and space debris could \"lead to mass casualties.\"",
      "The risk will only grow as space debris remains in orbit, the study authors warned. Trackable objects in orbit have doubled in the last decade. The number of daily flights has also nearly doubled since 2000. Large reentries occur almost weekly, the study authors note.",
      "\"Over 2,300 rocket bodies are already in orbit and will eventually reenter in an uncontrolled manner,\" the study noted. \"Airspace authorities will face the challenge of uncontrolled reentries for decades to come.\"",
      "Closing airspace to avoid collisions",
      "The study authors highlighted an incident in 2022, when a 20-ton rocket body was set to reenter the atmosphere. Predictions the night before the reentry showed that it may land over southern Europe. European space and air traffic industries issued a safety bulletin recommending that authorities implement airspace restrictions. Spanish and French authorities wound up closing part of their airspace. It was the first time airspace was closed for an uncontrolled reentry.",
      "The closures delayed 645 aircraft for about 29 minutes, including diverting some planes that were in the air. Airspaces in Italy, Portugal and Greece that did not close saw an \"unexpected increase in air traffic\" from diverted flights, creating \"different, operational risks\" than those posed by the falling space debris.",
      "\"The incident highlighted, among other things, a lack of preparation for this eventuality and a lack of harmonization of responses among states,\" the study authors noted.",
      "The rocket body eventually fell in the Pacific Ocean. The study authors argued that better than closing airspace would be if all rocket missions required controlled reentries, with charted flight paths and scheduled landings. Fewer than 35% of launches currently have controlled reentries, the study authors said.",
      "\"Uncontrolled rocket body reentries are a design choice, not a necessity,\" the study noted. \"If controlled reentries were used by all operators, the risks to people and aircraft would be greatly reduced.\"",

      "Taylor told CBS that he was open to using AI at first. But, after seeing many identical essays, often full of false or misleading information that was obviously AI-generated, he decided to ban it.",
      "\"If you type in a prompt, boom! There's the answer. But that means the student has now outsourced all of their thinking to a machine. They haven't worked out and developed the skills themselves,\" Taylor explained.",
      "In Taylor's philosophy classes, students have to complete handwritten assignments without any devices. Rather than allowing AI to do all the work, students are encouraged to discuss their views, analyze others' arguments and come to a conclusion on what's right.",
      "\"Using it responsibly is important, but I think there has to be some classroom spaces where it's prohibited and its use is eliminated,\" Taylor said.",
      "\"As soon as it's banned, it's forbidden fruit,\" Bickerstaff pointed out. She believes kids will use AI in ways that could be harmful if parents and educators don't allow or encourage their use.",
      "Instead, she's teaching students and teachers how to write effective AI prompts, which she says will enhance learning, and how to verify AI outputs.",
      "While both Bickerstaff and Taylor may not see eye-to-eye on bans, they both believe in taking a proactive, balanced approach to AI.",
      "\"We're living through an inflection point unlike anything we ever lived before,\" Bickerstaff said. \"Generative AI is becoming ubiquitous in a lot of our tools, social media and devices. If you have a new iPhone, then you already have generative A.I. models that are in your hands.\"",

      "And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump continues to make good on his campaign pledges. What do Americans think of the Trump 2.0 policies and the job Mr. Trump's doing as president?",
      "As Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency squad continue their sweep through the federal agencies, President Trump says they're doing so at his insistence and that there's more to come. But that revamp is leading to confusion. And the consequences are spreading across the country and around the world.",
      "How could the president's bureaucratic shakeup impact America's law enforcement, homeland security and intelligence capabilities? Plus, what's the impact of cutting U.S. aid to the countries that need it the most?",
      "We will talk with Texas Republican Congressman Michael McCaul and Minnesota Democratic Congressman Ilhan Omar. Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Hagerty will join us from the Senate Republican retreat in Florida.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We begin today with our first assessment of how President Trump and his policies are doing just three weeks into his second term. Our CBS poll finds that a majority of Americans, 53 percent, approve of the job he's doing. That's a better approval number than he ever reached during his first term in the White House.",
      "Joining us with more is our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Good to see you, Anthony.",
      "What's driving this?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: I will keep it simple, Margaret. He's doing, in the eyes of the public, what he said he would do in the campaign.",
      "There's political value in that. In fact, 70 percent of people say he's doing what he promised. That's whether they approve of him or not. Now, there's another part of this that continues over from the campaign. There were words that he was described as being tough, being energetic.",
      "And he still is today in big majority numbers. So, as people take a look in these first few weeks, there's been a lot of activity. They're getting that general sense of governance, and that's being reflected in these early numbers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's perception. What about the actual policies?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, let's start with the ones that are popular.",
      "And, again, these echo a lot of what we saw in the campaign. The idea of deporting those in the country illegally continues to be popular. We saw that in the campaign. Sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, again, majority in favor. We'd seen that in the campaign.",
      "For his supporters in particular, the focus on ending DEI is popular. We had seen in the campaign a lot of them thought those processes had gone too far. There are some other things in here that get more mixed reviews, I will add.",
      "The idea of the U.S. taking over Gaza is not seen as a good idea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Something he floated at a press conference this past week.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: He did, but it also gives you a little insight into how people are processing Donald Trump and what he does, because then, for a lot of his supporters, they say, well, that's not really his goal. That's a negotiating tactic.",
      "And then, on tariffs, those are not as popular. Those are things that the majority \u2013 with the exception of the ones on China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: People think it will raise prices. And that's important context here too, because people are still sensitive to price increases. A lot of them report that prices haven't gone down.",
      "Remember that Donald Trump won the election on inflation, and that was a big reason. And what we find now is two-thirds of people saying that they don't think the administration is focused enough on lowering prices. And that stands out as one of those big gaps when you talk about initial preferences, initial expectations and what's getting delivered.",
      "That's certainly going to be something to watch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's interesting, because, throughout the campaign, he was abundantly clear that tariffs were something he wanted to use. And we talked quite a lot about possible impact on inflation.",
      "I know you also polled on President Trump's work with Elon Musk and this so-called DOGE, Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're all kind of learning what it is. What do people think of it?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, exactly on that point, we're all sort of learning this, so I think this will take a while to play out.",
      "Initially, you get very partisan responses on the role that Elon Musk should or should not play. You get a majority of Republicans saying he should have at least some influence, though it's more of the MAGA base that really wants him to have a lot, and a lot of Democrats in opposition.",
      "Part of this is, too, the broad goals of cutting spending, of cutting foreign aid have things that have long been in the polling popular with Republicans. But in terms of the impact and approach, that may take a while for people to really see it play out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How you do it. And we will be talking about that ahead on the program.",
      "Anthony, thank you.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Republican Congressman Mike McCaul of Texas.",
      "Good morning. It's good to have you here.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-Texas): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to dig in to what has been happening, this mass confusion with USAID.",
      "There were 30 million metric tons of food sitting at a port in Houston all week because there weren't U.S. workers to unload the food aid, food American taxpayers had already bought, food that Secretary Rubio said should be delivered, but wasn't.",
      "How is this mass confusion increasing efficiency?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, if I could peel back on that a little bit, the confusion, I think, goes back to the Biden administration when they started to implement these woke policies of drag queen shows in Ecuador, when they started talking about LGBTQIA programs, like, say, in Latin American countries, how to sue Catholic governments, promoting atheism in Nepal, where you have Tibetan Buddhist monks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw the White House fact sheet on there. But this\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: This is what gave the USAID a black eye.",
      "I personally believe that USAID has a national security mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: If you go back to its inception in the '60s, under President Kennedy and the Cold War, it was to counter the Soviet Union. We need to return to the core mission principles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "Well, you have been a big supporter of USAID when you were chairman of House Foreign Affairs.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have talked about the great work that it does around the world.",
      "But back to this food aid, I mean, this isn't a theater program. This is food for starving people. How is getting it all locked up in these ports \u2013 I mean, it's the way it's being implemented that has drawn so much shock here. Do you think this is being done well?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, I think \u2013 so, the secretary, in response to all this \u2013 and, by the way, I \u2013 put holds on all those programs I was talking about that had nothing to do with the central core mission.",
      "However, the secretary made waivers on humanitarian assistance and PEPFAR, which has been the most successful global health program, initiated by President Bush, by the way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: The implementation of this is where I would urge the administration to move more expeditiously.",
      "I just got word about 10 minutes ago at the World Food Program now. These waivers are now being implemented, that it is being executed, that food will be going out, but, to your point, about $40 million in food rotting in these warehouses in Houston, about 500,000 metric tons on ships on the sea.",
      "The peace through food program dates back to the '50s\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: \u2026 after the Marshall Plan. It is to provide stability in fragile, unstable countries. It is to counter Russia, China and terrorism.",
      "It is our diplomatic power.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Otherwise, we're talking about bullets, as Mattis talked about and Lindsey Graham.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, that if you don't fully fund the State Department, you have got to buy me more bullets. That's Mattis' line.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Cool.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on how this is being done, Secretary of State Rubio keeps saying he's issuing waivers and he's getting things moving. I'm glad the World Food Program now says food is moving.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there's a huge divide between what he's saying and then the fact that there weren't USAID workers there to actually load ships or move things. There weren't folks to process.",
      "It seems a fundamental misunderstanding between the bosses and the operators. Is this really how it should be done? Why not review and then take action?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And there's a debate about whether you should \u2013 there is a top-to-bottom review.",
      "I think, after what happened under the Biden administration, it absolutely needs to be reviewed to get back to the core mission, as I talked about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: So that is being done.",
      "At the same time, putting a halt on all humanitarian assistance and lifesaving medicines, I think that's where Secretary Rubio issued these waivers for a reason\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: \u2026 in consultation with the president, President Trump. And it seems to me his department needs to start implementing the waivers.",
      "Now, again, the World Food Program is doing that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they have to be able to go back to work.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, that was before the courts, if people could even go back to work to implement what he's telling them to do.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And there is a temporary injunction on that issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: I would urge the State Department to put the adequate resources necessary to deliver this, because our foreign adversaries are looking at this.",
      "Just as they laughed at the Ecuador drag shows, they're also questioning what's happening now. And I think we need to have a strong presence in destabilized nations to keep out our adversaries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But do you think this was done intentionally, or are people like this individual Pete Marocco, who Secretary Rubio has authorized to run this, do they just not know how the department works or how USAID works?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: I really can't speak for him. I know that he's been in charge \u2013 put in charge of the foreign assistance program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should he come into Congress and answer questions, since there's a hearing on USAID this week?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, I do think the administration has provided, by the way, notification and consultation with the Foreign Affairs Committee that I chaired. And that is required under law.",
      "They have done that. I think, if they decide to terminate, that's a whole 'nother issue. My understanding is that they want to look at putting USAID underneath the State Department, which is not a novel concept.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: I mean, Madeleine Albright talked about this under\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And Bill Clinton and Warren Christopher talked about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Even Joe Biden talked about this.",
      "And I think putting it under State makes a lot of sense to me to provide the direct supervision and oversight.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: But you know how this department works, since you were the chair for so long of the committee overseeing it.",
      "When this Trump-appointed judge put that federal \u2013 the pause on the putting USAID workers on leave, he wrote in the opinion: \"No future lawsuit could undo the physical harm that might result if USAID employees are not informed of imminent security threats occurring in the countries to which they have relocated in the course of their service to the United States.\"",
      "He's saying that the messy way this rolled out put people in physical risk when they are deployed by our government to countries overseas. Did the secretary of state have any idea?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: The secretary of state issued the waivers for PEPFAR and for humanitarian both food and medicine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But people living and working in places like Syria aren't able to access computer systems and security warnings that are there.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: The \u2013 every \u2013 every president that comes in does a review.",
      "I would argue, though, that since the secretary's issued the waivers, that it's incumbent upon his subordinates now to implement these waivers so that we don't see what could happen where people are not getting their vaccines, they're not getting the HIV treatment, there are starving people in destabilized countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And then we see China and Russia.",
      "And, quite frankly, Lindsey Graham and I did the Global Fragility Act to impact the Sahel in Africa. That is turning into a terror safe haven. You got Ebola popping up in Uganda.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: These are serious issues that, if we don't start implementing waivers, you're going to see it get worse, not better.",
      "And I would urge the administration to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're striking a very different tone than Congressman Brian Mast, who was here last week. And he said there's a grift on the American people. He said PEPFAR and Americans shouldn't fund AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa because their governments might work with China.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: It's the best\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a divide in your party about this right now.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, it's the best \u2013 I can only speak to the program that President Bush started, and it was to save millions of lives.",
      "That is probably one of the \u2013 been the best goodwill missions in the United States and put the best face, no pun intended, on the nation overseas with our adversaries, countering them, with these people. We're saving their lives. The best global health program ever implemented by the United States was PEPFAR. I'd hate to see that go away.",
      "It will sunset once we achieve the mission. However, programs like that, when you look at the national security importance of USAID\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: \u2026 need to be maintained.",
      "And I go back to why it was implemented in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday night, the president ordered all foreign assistance to South Africa be halted and said we should prioritize the resettling of Afrikaner refugees. These are white South Africans.",
      "That means they will get priority over everyone, it seems, because there's a suspension of refugee entry into the United States, including those Afghan allies who worked along the United \u2013 alongside the United States.",
      "Are you going to try to help lift that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Yes, I believe \u2013 I did a comprehensive investigation that the debacle of Afghanistan that the Biden administration was responsible for\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: \u2026 including leaving our Afghan partners behind. Those\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should they get a carve-out from the Trump ban on refugees? Should the Afghans?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And I do believe that it was an unintended consequence that needs to be fixed.",
      "Look, we promised them that we would protect them when they worked with our service men and women in Afghanistan. These are the interpreters, the ones who were right alongside our combat veterans. They have these Special Immigrant Visas and P-1, P-2.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And it's my view that they should be allowed to go forward with the SIV program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And others.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And they have been vetted, by the way, Margaret. They have been vetted. Unlike some of the other groups they talk about, these have been vetted.",
      "They worked with our troops to defeat the Taliban, which, unfortunately, Biden surrendered to. But it seems to me we ought to live up to our word. Otherwise, down the road, in another conflict, no one's going to trust us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman McCaul, thank you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, who joins us this morning from Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY (R-Tennessee): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have a lot to get to with you today, but I want to start with the announcement from the White House that over 65,000 employees have accepted the offer to leave their jobs with pay through September 30. This is that deferred resignation program, or buyout, as it's called.",
      "Can you explain how putting federal workers on paid leave through September will save taxpayers money, if we're paying them not to work?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Margaret, eventually it will save taxpayers money.",
      "I think what President Trump is trying to do is be humane in the process of allowing them to make plans to find other employment. But I certainly think the government is far too big, far too bloated. And we're on a path now to start to see it shrink.",
      "This is the first step only, but we're moving in the right direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean the agencies won't hire replacements for these people who take the so-called buyout? Are you reducing head count?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think what we will see is each agency \u2013 yes, I think what we will see, Margaret, is each agency go through a top-to-bottom review to decide exactly what they need to do to deliver on behalf of the American public.",
      "As you know, there's been a lot of consternation and pearl-clutching about the activities of Elon Musk and his team. But their charge led by President Trump is to go in and find efficiencies, find opportunities and, frankly, deliver more of taxpayer dollars to the actual programs that are intended, less to overhead and administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you said, eventually, it will save money. I know you're on Appropriations Committee and you watch these things pretty closely here.",
      "When will it save money?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I would say certainly as soon as these people start to roll off the payroll. Again, I'm from the private sector, Margaret. My entire background has been in business.",
      "This is the way you do it. You come in, you look at the opportunities before you. President Trump has brought a new administration. And this is not unusual to take a hard look at these programs, and also to look for opportunities to cut bloat and waste.",
      "Look, we're $36 trillion in debt. Clearly, the American public needs\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 to see more accountability, more visibility, more performance for their taxpayer dollars.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And I think anyone who works in the private sector understands how layoffs work. The government is so unique, though, with laws establishing some of these agencies.",
      "And, as you know \u2013 and we will talk about it later in the program \u2013 some of this is tied up in the courts.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, since you're on banking, the budget director announced he's notified the Federal Reserve that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will no longer take congressional funding because it's not necessary.",
      "Elon Musk tweeted: \"Rest in peace.\"",
      "Can you tell us, did the White House inform\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I missed Elon Musk's tweet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Did the White House inform the Banking Committee that it's being dismantled? What does \"CFPB, rest in peace\" mean?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: So, I have had significant conversations with Russ Vought, who is our new OMB director.",
      "The CFPB has been out of control for some time. The way it's designed, I think, is unconstitutional. It has no oversight. It's been basically a reckless agency that's been allowed to go way beyond any mandate that I think was originally intended. So it's time to rein it in. And I'm applauding anything that we can do to bring more stability and more control to the federal government and take agencies like this back into some sort of sense of accountability and oversight.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what does that mean? Because it's established as an agency, and there are legal protections here.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, it was established as an agency that does not have the jurisdiction of the Congress.",
      "Its funding source is separate from us. It has no accountability. This is not the type of agency I think that the founding fathers contemplated. We actually contemplated a balance of power. Yet this rogue agency has been created. And, frankly, it's been used as a tool to come in and just hammer the American private sector and pursue initiatives that certain people like Rohit Chopra might have approved or Senator Elizabeth Warren might have approved, but this is not the way the American public should be funding and supporting programs of this nature.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So, a different government agency, USAID, and its fate is also in question. We looked at the Congressional Research Service definition here, because it was enshrined in law, USAID. It says, because Congress established it as independent within the executive branch, the president does not have the authority to abolish it. Congressional authorization would be required to abolish, move or consolidate USAID.",
      "So, have you \u2013 or do you expect Congress to actually authorize the president to dismantle and consolidate USAID?",

      "USAID has been out of control. I have demanded accountability from a AID. They have refused it. As an appropriator, I have asked them to be very clear about, for example, their role funding Hamas in Gaza. They would not comply. They will not tell us what they do.",

Are the courts the main line of defense here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): Yes. I mean, what we are witnessing is a constitutional crisis. We are seeing an executive branch that has decided that they are no longer going to abide by the Constitution, in honoring Congress' role in the creation of the agencies, in their role in deciding where money is allocated. And so the only recourse we have since our congressional leadership, the speaker will not stop the executive, is through the judiciary. And this is, you know, when you think about the checks and balances that we have, the courts are the only recourse we have at the moment.",
      "And we have seen - and when we talk about the illegality of what the executive is doing, we have seen every single executive order that has been challenged in the courts, was found to be illegal.",

      "Senator Hagerty, however, thought that Congress would be supportive of dismantling USAID after I read that - that description of the statute. It seems, though, that - that Democrats don't have a lot of leverage here to push this argument forward in Congress. Do you think you do?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Well, they don't have the numbers in order to dismantle through Congress. That's why they are going through this illegal - that's why they're going through this illegal route.",
      "We know that USAID has support, not just with Democrats, but with Republicans. I can't see McCaul taking a vote to dismantle USAID, you know. So - so we know that the - the votes are not there to dismantle the Department of Education. We know that the votes are not there to grant security clearances for them accessing Treasury. And - and so every single process that they are going through in implementing Trump's agenda -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's interesting that the first place to focus is such a small portion of federal spending, to look at - at - at aid. But when you look at the popularity, Secretary Rubio has right in saying that it's getting harder to defend foreign aid because it's not popular.",
      "We saw the Chicago Council on Global Affairs surveyed American opinions on foreign policy and they found a growing number want to reduce economic and military aid to other countries.",
      "So, how do you convince the public that your point of view is the right one, because it - it sounds like they're sliding the other way?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Well, foreign aid, I think, throughout the history of - of our country has not been popular with the American people because we don't have that many conversations about what it does, how much of it - it accounts for in our budget. A lot of people hear the millions, billions, and they don't fully have a concept of what - what that actually means.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

And - and how important it is both the soft power that we have as a country, how it keeps us competitive around the world, how it buys us goodwill. We - we can have the conversation.

      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was an active FBI agent who spoke with CBS's Scott Macfarlane last week. The agent asked for anonymity due to safety concerns, including the risk that private information about the individual could be made public, a practice known as doxxing.",
      "For more on that interview and the impact of the Trump administration's bureaucratic overhaul is Justice Department correspondent Scott Macfarlane. We're also joined by chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, homeland security contributor Samantha Vinograd, and cybersecurity expert and analyst Chris Krebs.",
      "It's good to have you all here.",
      "And even just trying to whittle this down to exactly what to ask you was hard because there has been so much happening.",
      "Scott, let's talk on the very immediate thing that was raised in that interview, physical security. You obtained an email from the acting FBI director that said he has concerns for the safety of personnel, as well as risks to their families.",
      "What exactly does he have in mind, and what's being done to protect them?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Let's take a moment to underscore the significance of that message. These are people who chase terrorists for a living. And there's an internal email they're worried about, a unique form of retribution at this moment. That gives you an indication the turmoil the FBI is in at this moment.",
      "There are two types of retribution these agents are concerned about. First of all, as you mentioned, the doxxing, that people are going to come after them and they're concerned that the January 6th rioters, now lionized, now galvanized, or their supporters and sympathizers will come after the agents who are responsible for nearly 1,600 arrests.",
      "But more fundamentally, and perhaps more immediately, they're worried about retribution for doing their jobs, professional retribution, that there will be a purge, firings, forced resignations that are going to gut America's joint terror task force, child predator task forces and violent crime units.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to be clear, FBI agents don't get to pick what assignments they get, just like the United States military does not get to pick it.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And this was not a Washington, D.C., investigation. This involved every field office of the FBI nationwide. They were assigned in communities from California to Connecticut.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sam, when you look at some of the national security implications here, it's not just the domestic law enforcement. The CIA offered a different early retirement and resignation option. The CIA director said if an individual works on a high-priority issue or has a specific language skill, they can't take the so-called buyout we've been talking about earlier in the program. They are trying to target these cutbacks in specific ways. Can you actually really do that and - and is this a good idea?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, I think it depends the subjectivity of how you define national security. I would argue that all of the CIA count as a critical national security position.",
      "But more broadly, Margaret, I worked for three presidents. They all had different approaches to the federal workforce. What concerns me with this administration's rapid elimination approach is that it creates a wildly uneven playing field with our adversaries.",
      "The KGB is not shedding agents. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not losing diplomats. What we have in this moment is tens of thousands of personnel taking the buyout, leaving their jobs. We have countless others on leave. We have others who are worried about taking certain assignments because of fear of retribution, or spending hours talking to family and lawyers about their professional options while being expected to do their day job.",
      "We don't have all hands on deck in a very dynamic threat environment. And longer term, I am concerned what this will do for recruitment to the federal government and redundancy. It takes years to train and equip a spy. It takes years to train an aid worker. So, coming back from the talent cuts that we're seeing could have a generational impact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that - the comparison was made early in the program, oh, well, in the private sectors they do buyout. Even in the private sector people can say, hey, we lost some institutional knowledge or expertise here. You're saying American government, the taxpayer invested in that expertise and that's what's being lost here.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: And there's no quick fix switch to turn it back on. It will be a longer term investment in getting talent back onto the field.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Chris, you know, in trying to whittle down who this applies to, who it doesn't, CBS has obtained an internal communication given out at homeland security, employees were told anyone working for Customs and Border Patrol can't take the buyout. ICE, other immigration related departments, TSA you can't, FEMA, parts of it at least you can't. And the agency you used to run, CISA, was singled out.",
      "But then we're seeing conflicting reports that say very different things about parts of that agency being affected and dismantled. Cybersecurity is the new frontier for warfare, right?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Absolutely. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So - so, what does this mean?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Well, it's not clear, right? Let - let's also step back a minute and recognize that President Trump, in his first administration, in 2018, established CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is when you worked for -",
      "CHRIS KREBS: That's what it - that's the agency I ran.",
      "And to your point the threat landscape it as active and dynamic as ever. And it's not as if we're, all of a sudden unplugging systems today that we weren't doing two to three months ago. It's becoming more digitized, more connected. And the opportunity space for the bad guys is also increasing. Even during the campaign the vice president's phone was accessed by Chinese threat actors. So, we have this opportunity right now to continue to invest in our cybersecurity defenses.",
      "So, the conversations I've had with CISA personnel is that they're going to hang on because the public service mission is so important to many of these individuals it could be making millions in the cybersecurity industry, in the private sector. They are committed to getting through this, to continuing to protect the American people, the American networks, the federal - the federal government. That's the opportunity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Noem said CISA has gotten far off mission. How was that received?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Well, I think to Sam's point, you know, every administration has a set of - policies and priorities that they - they go in, they review, they sometimes do it rapidly, sometimes do it slowly, at the beginning of the Biden administration, Scott, as we were talking about, the - they took down or disassembled the Department of Justice China Task Force. China is obviously a huge threat.",
      "There are elements of CISA, the elections security mission specifically, that was clearly spelled out in Project 2025 as a distraction, as something that's not core. And I will say that having worked with those people, they're American patriots. They are public servants. My hope is that as the administrative review process goes through, that they are provided opportunities to work elsewhere because they are - they're effective and there are other things that we have to continue to be doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to drill down more, but I - come back with everything these days, Jan, to the fundamental questions, is this legal? As our legal expert, you know, some of these buyouts are - are tied up in court. Is it legal?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Right. And we're going to have a hearing this week, tomorrow, on whether or not these pauses can remain. I think the judge is going to keep this pause in place, is kind of putting it on hold, even though this is one of the weaker of all the lawsuits that's been filed against these many executive orders.",
      "The argument is that Trump just went about this the wrong way. So, that's why it's different than when Bill Clinton cut over 200,000 jobs from the federal government when he was in office. He involved Congress.",
      "And that's a common theme with all of these lawsuits. And there are many. I mean, dozens and dozens from coast to coast that these executive orders, and doing these executive orders, Trump did it unilaterally. That - and he cannot do that. Like, he has to involve Congress. And he's usurping Congress' role.",
      "So, whatever the judge does in - in this case on the buyouts, you know, I think it does raise one interesting issue when you're talking about the impact on people and how some of these orders, as you guys were discussing, what about those 65,000 people who say they want those?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: They want to do this. They may have a claim now. They're relying on this. So, that raises a whole nother legal issue if these buyouts cannot proceed.",
      "So, all of this is going to take some time to sort out. The courts right now are definitely putting up, you know, yellow to red lights on a lot of these executive orders.",
      "But, you know, like our polling is showing, like I - this, to me, regardless of whether these end up being legal losses, losses in the courts, they're political wins. It's - it's a victory for Trump because he's showing that he's doing, as our polling reflects, what he promised in the campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: And so, you know, regardless of how many of these end up surviving at the end of the day -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Trump can still say this was a win for him politically.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And we keep coming back to that, but it's not just what you do it's how you do it. And that's what I think is so illuminating to hear from you all from inside the agencies.",
      "Scott, I want to come back to you because the attorney general, Bondi, dissolved an FBI task force that worked to uncover covert efforts by Russia, China, Iran and others to manipulate voters. There seems to be an effort to refocus the Justice Department. What's that focus?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes, there were some first-day orders when Pam Bondi arrived at main justice this week, including repurposing this foreign influence task force the FBI has, trying to shepherd its resources more towards drug cartels versus the ongoing kinetic foreign influence campaigns, which have been part of our country for some time now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That Chris was mentioning, right.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: That - that Chris knows quite well.",
      "I think their concern though is broader than just that task force. If there is a gutting of FBI personnel, either by giving them new jobs that aren't what they're there for or firing them, you can't just replace an FBI agent tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It takes many months of training, background checks, polygraphs, they go to Quantico. It takes a long time to deploy, years to get them up to speed. And for a supervisor we're told it takes five to seven years to get somebody in place. That's something that goes beyond the Trump term.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, on the legal question, Democrats are throwing around constitutional crisis as a phrase.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I don't see that yet. I mean so far the president is not ignoring judicial orders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So far.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two weeks in.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: And they're appealing them. They're, you know, so I -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the - on the congressional consent portion, though, we're not - you did hear from - from Congressman McCaul that, well, if it's in statute, that's another matter. You have to at least consult with Congress before you destroy an agency or dismantle it.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Right. And all of these executive orders raise similar legal issues, but they're different because they depend on what the law at issue actually says. So, the USAID, you know, trying to put those employees that you were talking about on administrative leave, I think there's about 3,000 of them, and then kind of the force evacuation from their host countries, a very highly regarded federal district court judge here in D.C., a Trump appointees, put that on hold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: And pointed to a specific federal law that says that he has to consult Congress before you're going to dismantle or really kind of reorganize USAID.",
      "So, that one, that's a - that's a pretty strong lawsuit right there. That's a strong one. But that judge also upheld part of Secretary Rubio's order that would freeze future funding of USAID projects. So, (INAUDIBLE).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chris, quickly, on the national security questions of having these DOGE employees, which the White House says have security clearances and are only looking inside systems, read only, is there risk?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Well, I - theoretically there are various risks associated with access to systems. You - you could have sensitive information, proprietary information. You could be plugging in systems that aren't necessarily clean or haven't gone through the normal protocols for access to these government systems. You could also see some of these folks getting targeted by Chinese or Russian actors -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

    "summary": "Rep. Ilhan Omar said the executive branch's recent actions have created a \"constitutional crisis.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, said Sunday that she doesn't think Republicans have the support in Congress to approve the Trump administration's gutting of federal agencies and programs, saying \"that's why they're not bringing it through Congress.\"",
      "\"Every single process that they are going through in implementing Trump's agenda is, at the moment, illegal, and they know they don't have the support for it in Congress,\" Omar said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Recent actions that the Trump administration has argued are being put in place to make the government more efficient have prompted confusion through corners of the federal government and beyond, including actions with serious implications for the main U.S. agency handling foreign assistance. On Friday, a judge prevented the Trump administration from placing 2,200 employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development, known as USAID, on administrative leave, after a pause on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID the week prior.",
      "Omar, who was born in Somalia and has said she benefited from USAID programs while living in a refugee camp as a child, argued Sunday that USAID has support \"not just with Democrats, but with Republicans.\" And she noted that even with GOP control of both the House and Senate, \"the votes are not there\" for other recent developments, like granting Elon Musk's team access to Treasury Department data or the possibility of dismantling the Department of Education.",
      "With the dynamic, Omar characterized the current moment as a \"constitutional crisis.\"",
      "\"We are seeing an executive branch that has decided that they are no longer going to abide by the Constitution in honoring Congress's role in the creation of the agencies, in their role in deciding where money is allocated,\" Omar said.",
      "Omar said that \"the only recourse we have\" is through the judiciary branch, noting that the bulk of the Trump administration's controversial and sweeping moves to overhaul the federal bureaucracy so far have been temporarily halted by judges, including some who were Republican-appointed. She said the moves by judges \"should give faith to the American people.\"",
      "\"Our courts are working as they should,\" Omar said. \"The checks and balances are working. What is not working is the way that the executive is behaving and the congressional leadership that is failing the American people.\"",
      "On the issue of foreign aid more broadly, Omar acknowledged that it hasn't always been popular among Americans, which she attributed to a messaging disconnect on where the aid is going and for what use.",
      "\"A lot of people hear the millions, billions, and they don't fully have a concept of what that actually means, the lives it touches, and how important it is \u2014 both the soft power that we have as a country, how it keeps us competitive around the world, how it buys us goodwill,\" Omar said.",
      "Meanwhile, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, argued that USAID \"needs to be reviewed to get back to the core mission,\" while stressing that \"we need to have a strong presence in destabilized nations to keep out our adversaries.\"",
      "Trump ally Sen. Bill Hagerty was asked on \"Face the Nation\" about Congress' views on dismantling and consolidating USAID. The Tennessee Republican argued that there's a \"tremendous appetite\" to do so, saying \"USAID has been out of control.\"",
      "\"What we want to see is alignment of our programs with America's national security interest,\" he said.",
      "Hagerty also defended the Trump administration's proposed buyouts for federal workers, a deadline for which a judge temporarily halted\u00a0on Thursday, saying it's \"not unusual to take a hard look at these programs\" and adding that he expects each agency to go through a \"top to bottom review.\"",
      "\"There's been a lot of consternation and pearl clutching about the activities of Elon Musk and his team, but their charge, led by President Trump, is to go in and find efficiencies, find opportunities, and, frankly, deliver more of taxpayer dollars to the actual programs that are intended, less to overhead in administration,\" Hagerty added.",

It's the Patriots against Falcons in Super Bowl LI \u2026 the Red Sox against the Yankees \u2026 the Heat against the Spurs \u2026 and every damn sports movie ever made. The scoreboard makes for a grim canvas. Time is winding down. All looks lost. But one team refuses to concede.",

      "And then, there's a financial curveball for a strike (too complicated to spell out here), but the good guys prevail. The ballclub comes together, putting the collective over the individual. A few breaks (and a few news breaks) go our way. And suddenly, Sports Illustrated is back from the brink.",

    "summary": "A program begun in Zimbabwe in which grandmothers and older listeners serve as \"first responders\" for those seeking mental health assistance in underserved communities has now expanded to nine countries, including the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Dixon Chibanda remembers like yesterday the moment in 2005 that changed his life. \"During my formative years working as a psychiatrist, I lost a patient of mine to suicide. Erica was her name. She had hanged herself from a mango tree in the family garden.\"",
      "Erica was just 25 years old.",
      "Chibanda, a psychiatrist based in Harare, Zimbabwe, says her family knew she needed help. \"They lived some 200 miles away from where I worked,\" he said. \"And they just didn't have the equivalent of US$15 to get onto a bus to come to the hospital.\"",
      "At the time, there were only 10 psychiatrists serving 13 million people in Zimbabwe. So, Chibanda came up with an idea involving grandmothers: \"These grandmas were actually, you know, the custodians of the local culture and the wisdom, and they were rooted in their communities. And I was like, what if we could train them to be the first port of call for anyone needing to talk in a community?\"",
      "So, in 2006, Chibanda introduced the \"Friendship Bench,\" a talk therapy program that brings mental healthcare directly into underserved communities. The program is free, and the grandmothers were happy to donate their time.",
      "He chronicled this journey in a new book: \"The Friendship Bench: How Fourteen Grandmothers Inspired a Mental Health Revolution\" (New World Library).",
      "\"When I first started this, in fact we called it the Mental Health Bench,\" he said. \"Interestingly, nobody came to the Mental Health Bench, because of the stigma, until the grandmas said, 'You know, why don't you turn it into a Friendship Bench?'\"",
      "During that first year, 14 volunteer grandmothers shared a Friendship Bench with several hundred visitors in that one suburb. Chibanda says the program has since expanded beyond grandmothers to include over 3,000 older listeners who last year saw more than 300,000 people all over Zimbabwe.",
      "He said, \"There are a lot of people out there who are struggling to just connect with another human being. And this gives them that opportunity, to be able to sit down with someone who is empathic.\"",
      "Globally, just under 300 million people are struggling with depression, according to the World Health Organization. Only about one-third of them receive any treatment. And at a time when we're facing an epidemic of loneliness and isolation affecting 1 in 5 American adults (according to a 2024 Gallup poll), the Friendship Bench is hitting the road, expanding to vulnerable communities in 9 countries and counting, including the United States.",
      "At the Washington Seniors Wellness Center, in our nation's capital, the program is being piloted by the nonprofit organization HelpAge USA, which focuses on the inclusion of older people.",
      "Seventy-four-year-old Arnette Ibitayo says she was struggling with the deaths of her son and brother. \"My son's was sudden; he had a heart attack at 44,\" she said. \"And then my brother had COVID.\"",
      "She turned to the Friendship Bench. \"So I'm, you know, feeling down, depressed,\" she said. \"I think I need to talk to somebody, because I felt like isolating and staying home. And it was very comforting to get it out. And I wasn't judged, and I was able to speak freely, and the person gave me some helpful advice.\"",
      "That person was Theresa Kelly, a retired schoolteacher, who listened to Ibitayo's story. \"We don't solve problems for them,\" Kelly said. \"Sometimes you don't realize that you can be your own problem solver. And when they finish, we want them to leave empowered.\"",
      "A screening process refers more serious cases to professionals. For almost 20 years now, Dr. Chibanda has been using his medical training to help analyze and improve the program. \"The Friendship Bench is actually rooted in a lot of research,\" he said. \"These grandmas were a lot more effective than trained mental health professionals at alleviating symptoms of both depression and generalized anxiety disorders.\"",
      "Arnette Ibitayo said she felt better after just one session with Kelly: \"I was more at ease. It worked. It was working.\"",
      "\"You feel a little less depressed now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, uh-huh. There's hope that things are going to be better.\"",
      "So, what's the special sauce when it comes to grandparents? According to Chibanda, it is \"the natural abilities that come with having a long-lived life on the planet. They've seen a lot. They've experienced a lot. They have, you know, the battle scars of life, which they bring to the bench. All we're doing as Friendship Bench is helping them to use those stories, those experiences, to help others.\"",
      "And the bench is giving them something back. Theresa Kelly said, \"I love helping people, empowering people. It makes me feel good. Makes me feel that [I have] still another purpose, that after retirement there's still something, you know, that I can do that can help others, that it's not over.\"",

      "His partisans and his voters, in particular, say he's got the right amount of focus on matters like ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs and deporting those who are in the country illegally.",
      "His deportation policy finds majority approval overall \u2014 just as most voters said they wanted during the campaign \u2014 and that extends to sending troops to the border, too.",
      "But one key issue looms: Most Americans say the administration isn't focused enough on lowering prices. Inflation was a key reason Mr. Trump won the election.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, voters picked many of these labels in describing Mr. Trump, and today, the percentages for them find similar or higher levels among Americans overall.",
      "And a large majority say he's doing what he said he would, whether they approve of him or not.",
      "During the campaign most voters \u2014 and overwhelmingly, Trump voters \u2014 supported the idea of his new mass deportation program. So, today's approval of the current program remains in alignment with that sentiment.",
      "Comparably more Americans are in favor of sending U.S. troops to the border. And while they are split on the idea of creating large detention centers where people\u00a0would be kept, Mr. Trump's 2024 voters are strongly in favor of that.",
      "Israel and Gaza",
      "Trump's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict draws overall positive marks, driven largely by support from Republicans.",
      "One item in particular, the president's recent comments about taking over Gaza, drew wide attention (most Americans say they heard about them), and very few outright think that would be a good idea. Others say it depends.",
      "But the matter also opens more insight into how Americans view Mr. Trump's approach. Most think his goal, at least partially, is really to open up negotiations for something else.",
      "Prices and tariffs",
      "Most Americans today feel the new administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices of goods and services. Lowering prices is the one item tested that a solid majority of the country agree Mr. Trump's team should be focusing on more. That includes almost half of Republicans, even as they say he's focusing the right amount on a wide range of other items.",
      "Those who today expect his policies to lower prices don't expect it to happen overnight. Many of them think it'll take at least six months.",
      "The administration gets relatively higher \"right amount\"-of-focus support for items like ending DEI programs and cutting foreign aid, driven by large numbers of Republicans thinking these should be a focus.",
      "The push for tariffs may be impacting public concern about prices. Tariffs on countries besides China aren't popular with most, and nearly three in four think new tariffs on imported goods would generally lead to price increases. (And not necessarily to more jobs or stopping fentanyl.)",
      "People who think tariffs would lead to higher prices are more likely to think Mr. Trump's policies in general will lead to higher grocery prices and won't make them financially better off.",
      "Musk, DOGE and influence",
      "Republicans tend to think Elon Musk should have at least some influence over government operations and spending, though not necessarily \"a lot\" of influence, while Democrats tend to say he should have none, or not much.",
      "That said, most Trump voters and Republicans in large numbers think the administration is more generally putting the right amount of focus on cutting spending and cutting foreign aid.",

      "Until 24 years after Danni's death.",
      "Matt Boxmeyer was a detective sergeant with Gallatin County. He took an interest in Danni Houchins and her family.",
      "Matt Boxmeyer: I found out that they really hadn't been given much information back in 1996 regarding the investigation, which is not uncommon. \u2026 with investigations, you know, you don't openly talk about 'em with the family usually.",

      "Stephanie Mollet: I was so angry at the people who lied to my family, and let my sister's murder go unsolved, but uninvestigated for all of these years.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: I learned that rather than drowning on just water, Danni's head had been held down in the mud \u2026 she had mud all the way down into her lungs and into her stomach. ... there was subcutaneous bruising on the back of her neck \u2026 someone had held her head down forcefully. \u2026 there was, vaginal injuries. \u2026 there was semen in her underwear. \u2026 she had fought and scratched.",
      "Peter Van Sant: This is like a \u2014 a nuclear bomb going off emotionally, I would think for this family and for you.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: I remember asking them, \"so you mean to tell me that in fact, my sister was raped?\" And they said, \"yes, we believe she was raped.\" \u2026 I remember (sigh) not being able to breathe. I remember feeling like I needed to puke.",
      "In 2021, with Danni's family now knowing the explosive truth, solving Danni's murder would become a top priority for newly appointed Sheriff Dan Springer.",
      "Peter Van Sant: You were a rookie deputy when this crime came down, right?",
      "Sheriff Dan Springer: Yeah. \u2026 Five days after I started is when we found Danni's body.",

      "Tom Elfmont: I just don't give up on something. I just don't do it.",
      "He'd spent a lifetime in tough jobs, from a soldier in Vietnam to a cop working the streets of LA.",
      "Tom Elfmont: I wanted to put bad people in jail.",

      "Tom Elfmont: She was a great kid. And the way she died \u2014 I get choked up about this a little bit, really, to this day, bothers me. And so, when they said, would you like to work the case? I said, \"yes, I wanna work the case.\"",
      "Stephanie Mollet: I, of course, internet stalked him immediately and came to find out that he's like the man that never retires.",
      "Tom Elfmont: I told Stephanie, \"I will solve this case, Stephanie.\" And she said, \"OK, I'm gonna trust you.\"",
      "And with Elfmont leading the way, he soon found a suspect.",

      "AT LAST \u2013 A BREAK IN THE CASE",
      "By mid-2023, retired-LAPD Captain Tom Elfmont was back to working full-time, committed to finding Danni Houchins' killer.",
      "Tom Elfmont: The only reason I stayed in it was Danni.",
      "For Danni's sister, Stephanie Mollet, Elfmont's refreshing dedication, professionalism and enthusiasm was what the case had always needed.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What does Tom do?",
      "Stephanie Mollet: Tom got to work. Tom worked on Danni's case every day. He went through and reexamined all of the evidence.",
      "Elfmont had access to everything, including a list of potential suspects from the old case file and that previously tested clothing that Danni had been wearing when she was found.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: He most importantly made sure that DNA got tested.",
      "Elfmont asked the Montana State Crime Lab to use their newest technology to retest the semen on Danni's underwear. At last, a breakthrough: a partial DNA profile. But there were no matches to names in the case file, and when Elfmont compared it to CODIS \u2014 the vast federal digital repository of DNA samples from convicted felons \u2014",
      "Tom Elfmont: We didn't get any hits.",
      "But Elfmont was undeterred and decided to go a less conventional route. He turned to genetic genealogy, and investigative genealogist CeCe Moore.",
      "CeCe Moore: Since I started working with law enforcement in 2018, I've been able to help \u2026 solve over 325 cases.",
      "Moore is an expert at building out family trees from DNA samples using information from popular genealogy websites \u2013 bringing cold cases back to life. But to solve this case, Moore needed a special type of DNA profile. Problem was, they didn't have enough DNA from that semen.",
      "CeCe Moore: We have to start from scratch, which means there has to be remaining biological evidence for us to go back and retest using more advanced technology.",
      "Elfmont did have more evidence for retesting: four male hairs that had been found on Danni, which had been perfectly preserved for 27 years. They had never yielded any usable DNA because were \"rootless\" hairs \u2013 without any skin cells, but Elfmont asked around and connected with Astrea Forensics, a state-of-the-art private lab that's at the forefront of extracting DNA from previously unattainable genetic matter.",
      "As if there wasn't enough drama in this case, the first two hairs Astrea tested produced nothing useable.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So the last two hairs are examined, are they able to get a profile?",
      "Tom Elfmont: Yes. In the last hair. \u2026 Oh, I was so excited!",
      "It was a critical breakthrough. Elfmont got permission from a judge to compare this enhanced DNA profile to samples in popular genealogy databases, where people voluntarily submit their DNA profiles. By spring, 2024, Moore had what she needed to get to work.",
      "CeCe Moore: I'm looking for patterns, commonalities, overlaps, eventually common ancestors.",
      "Moore was able to identify the great grandparents on both sides of the suspect's family tree. She then found one marriage that proved decisive.",
      "CeCe Moore: The couple that I finally zeroed in on \u2026 they had a lot of children.",
      "Including three sons. Moore felt like she had to be close, but there was a problem.",
      "CeCe Moore: What was really confounding was that everybody lived in New Hampshire. \u2026 yet the mystery was what was the link to Montana?",
      "Moore scoured through the birth indexes, marriage certificates, and even the social media of those sons.",
      "CeCe Moore: When I finally got to the youngest son's Facebook page, he had posted that he moved to Bozeman, Montana on July 1st, 1996.",
      "Remember, Danni had been murdered in September 1996.",
      "CeCe Moore: And finally, all the pieces fell into place. \u2026 On May 1st, 2024, I called up the detectives to let them know that I believed I had identified Danni's killer.",
      "Finally, after nearly 28 years, it was now time for Elfmont to call Mollet and give her the momentous news.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: We've found Danni's killer, and he is alive, and we are going to make a case against him.",
      "The suspect was Paul Hutchinson, a married father of two, who, Elfmont soon learned, was widely known and respected in local hunting and fishing circles.",
      "Tom Elfmont: We learned that he's been working for the Bureau of Land Management in Dillon, Montana, for 22 years as a fisheries biologist. \u2026 He was a big outdoorsman, bow hunter, rifle hunter, fisherman, trapper.",
      "And, incredibly, it turned out Mollet's childhood friend, Rachelle Schrute knew Hutchinson. He was a trusted mentor who she had first met in the early 2000s.",
      "Rachelle Schrute: Paul came across as \u2026 just an under-the-radar person that \u2026 was always so kind of calm and quiet. \u2026 He was just so utterly unremarkable.",
      "\"I KNEW WE HAD HIM\"",
      "Stephanie Mollet had spent years dreaming of the day someone would be held responsible for her sister's murder. That day \u2014 that dream \u2014 seemed to be finally coming true.",
      "Stephanie Mollet: It was the moment at which I knew that everything I had put into my fight for my sister had been worth it.",
      "In September 1996, suspect Paul Hutchinson was 27 years old. He had served in the Marine Corps, then moved to Bozeman to study at Montana State University, just 13 miles from where Danni's body was discovered.",
      "Tom Elfmont: When he was at Montana State, he had a work-study \u2026 he worked for the Fish and Wildlife Service \u2026 which would have put him on the waterways around Belgrade.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Where on September 21st, 1996, Danni ended up on a hike.",
      "Tom Elfmont: That's correct.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Do you think your sister Danni knew Paul Hutchinson?",
      "Stephanie Mollet: No. Paul Hutchinson was a stranger to Danni. \u2026 there's no way that she would've known him.",
      "But many people in the area did know Hutchinson, through his passion for hunting and fishing and high-profile government job.",

      "STEPHANIE MOLLET (to reporters): The sheriff \u2026 lied to my parents \u2026 bold-face lied and betrayed the trust of shocked and grieving parents. \u2026 those institutions failed my sister, failed my family, and failed this community.\"",

After finding Kristen, Colby Trickle says he called 911, and as he later told police, he picked up the gun and thought about ending his life. What troubled Burkholder is where Colby Trickle put the gun after he changed his mind: back on Kristen's stomach.",

In this case, I wasn't really seeing that. \u2026 So, I'm going, well, I have to take the husband's statement at word value that he was there and the gun went off, and she is dead.",

      "Kristen decided to marry Colby Trickle and eventually moved almost 300 miles away to Kansas City.",
      "But life for the couple was difficult says Brant Rice. Colby Trickle enlisted with the Army Reserve and did odd jobs. Kristen Trickle worked at a vet clinic; money was tight.",

      "Det. JB Burkholder: He, um, had conversations with her \u00a0\u2026 which would be described as a sexting conversation.",
      "Also on that cellphone, according to Burkholder, was evidence that contradicted what Colby had first told investigators when asked about life insurance on his wife.",

      "COLBY TRICKLE: Not that I know of.",

      "Erin Moriarty: And do you think that's the .357?",
      "Det. JB Burkholder: That's the only .357 \u2026 in the house that we found.",

      "Still, the investigation stalled.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You have all these investigators who are uncovering more and more evidence that there's something really wrong with this case. \u2026 and you've got the coroner who calls this a suicide. I mean, that's a problem, isn't it?",

      "Erin Moriarty: It was initially, wasn't it?",
      "Aaron Cunningham: Sure. It was certainly, as \u2014 as far as their ability to investigate as efficiently as they normally would.",
      "Cunningham says that the coroner's determination that Kristen Trickle had died by suicide limited the investigators' ability to obtain search warrants.",
      "Aaron Cunningham: There was still elements of the investigation law enforcement wanted to follow up on.",
      "In the winter of 2020, Colby Trickle began collecting payouts from two insurance policies: $23,000 from Walmart and $100,000 from the U.S. military. Meanwhile, investigators continued to learn more about his time in the military.",

      "Det. JB Burkholder: Right.",
      "But even with what looked like blatant lies and an apparent motive to kill his wife, police didn't arrest Colby Trickle. So, in the year after Kristen Trickle's death, authorities watched as Colby went on with his life.",

      "Robert Anderson: \u2026 certainly the insurance money \u2026 provides motive. \u2026 But in addition \u2026 being in bed next to your husband, naked, shooting oneself in the face \u2026 after having set alarms, uh, to get up the next day for work \u2026 after setting out candy for Halloween. \u2026 These circumstances don't point to a woman who was planning a suicide.",

      "Instead she says, Kristen Trickle had suffered from depression since childhood.",
      "Cassy Zeigler: I think that Kristen dealt with a lot more pain in her life than people acknowledged. \u2026 I don't think there's any worse rejection in life than to be rejected by her biological mother at an early age. That's exactly what happened \u2026",
      "Colby Trickle's attorney felt confident. Going into the trial, the coroner was standing by his assessment that Kristen Trickle's death was a suicide.",

      "So Anderson knew he had to do something to convince a jury that Kristen Trickle didn't die by suicide. And that's when he pursued a different type of autopsy \u2014 a psychological one \u2014 an autopsy of the mind. And to conduct it, Anderson hired a forensic psychologist, Dr. Ashley Christiansen. Her job was to determine Kristen Trickle's state of mind leading up to her death.",
      "Robert Anderson: \u2026 being unable to speak with them \u2026 because they're, of course, no longer here, they have to speak with their family, their friends, their coworkers. They review any social media, diaries, journals, anything that they can \u2026",
      "Christiansen's conclusions would eventually take center stage at Colby Trickle's trial. It was September 2023, and Prosecutor Cunningham began by telling the jury that Kristen Trickle was murdered for the oldest reasons in the world.",
      "AARON CUNNINGHAM (in court): this case is as simple as A, B, C.",
      "AARON CUNNINGHAM (in court): A, an affair. B, a breakdown of control, and C, cold hard cash.",
      "Colby Trickle's attorney disputed that. Cassy Zeigler says his alleged affair was really just an online flirtation.",
      "Cassy Zeigler: I don't think there was a plan \u2026 to have this long-term intimate affair.",
      "She also said she doesn't believe that Colby Trickle plotted to kill Kristen Trickle for cash. And about that Google search into the life insurance payout? Zeigler says Colby Trickle doesn't remember doing that search, but she acknowledges he had been filling out paperwork around that time for his own military life insurance and if he did do it, maybe that's why.",
      "Erin Moriarty: It's just a coincidence that this is happening days before his wife died?",
      "Cassy Zeigler: Unfortunately, so. Yeah. Bad timing.",
      "At trial, the jury learned that Colby Trickle had not only collected more than $120,000 from two life insurance policies on his wife \u2014 he had already gone through it.",
      "Aaron Cunningham: I think had spent all of the money in approximately eight months.",
      "What did he spend the money on? When Burkholder took the stand, he was asked to describe one expenditure in particular.",
      "AARON CUNNINGHAM (in court) There's a $1,942 payment to True Touch Dolls. Were you able to determine what that was?",
      "DET. JB BURKHOLDER: This is a company that made and manufactures and distributes, life-size sex dolls.",
      "Colby Trickle's attorney says Colby was having trouble sleeping alone and was quite open about the purchase.",
      "Cassy Zeigler: He went and talked to his mother about it.",
      "Erin Moriarty: That's a little odd, I guess.",
      "Cassy Zeigler: Yeah. If you're gonna buy a sex toy ,,, a grown man's not gonna go talk to his mother about this sex doll he's going to buy.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What was your reaction to that?",
      "Pastor Brant Rice: Disgusted. Just disgusted.",
      "Erin Moriarty: It was described at trial that he needed this doll for comfort.",

      "PASTOR BRANT RICE: (in court) I feel that she had really begun to stand up for herself. We were proud of her for that.",
      "And there were texts, says Cunningham, that seem to support that Colby Trickle feared he was losing control over Kristen Trickle. On April 8, 2019, when Colby texted that Kristen seemed different and pushy with things, she responded:",
      "Aaron Cunningham (reading text): I'm just deciding to stick up for myself \u2026 Just like you, I'm taking control of the situation.",
      "And then prosecutors called their star witness, Dr. Ashley Christiansen.",
      "DR. ASHLEY CHRISTIANSEN (in court) Right around the time of her death, there was a lot of data suggesting that she had a lot of hope.",
      "Christiansen testified that Kristen Trickle talked to family members about future plans and seemed optimistic.",
      "DR. ASHLEY CHRISTIANSEN (in court): She wanted to open her own either pet boarding or dog grooming business and had discussed \u2026 this goal for opening her business.",
      "But Christiansen also testified that she interviewed Colby Trickle for her report, and he offered what sounded like a reason why Kristen Trickle might have been stressed. He told the doctor Kristen knew about his online relationship with that other woman.",
      "DR. ASHLEY CHRISTIANSEN (in court): He reported that they had last discussed that relationship the week of her death.",
      "But remember, in his police interview, Colby Trickle had told investigators that he didn't think his wife knew.",
      "DETECTIVE: Did Kristen find out about that relationship?",
      "COLBY TRICKLE: Not that I know of.",
      "Erin Moriarty: So, which is it, did she know? \u2026 Or she didn't know?",
      "Cassy Zeigler: I believe she knew.",
      "Whether or not Kristen knew, Dr. Christiansen told the jury she believed that at the time of her death, Kristen was at a low risk for suicide.",
      "DR. CHRISTIANSEN (in court): It is my opinion \u2026 that it is relatively less likely that her death was the result of suicide.",
      "Cassy Zeigler: I love those words. Relatively less likely. \u2026 that doesn't tell me anything \u2026 we can't know the mind of someone who's going to end their life.",
      "Defense attorney Zeigler does not think the report should have been allowed in as evidence. She points out that Christiansen, who never met Kristen Trickle, did interviews and prepared her report nearly two years after Kristen's death. And Zeigler believes people's memories change over time.",
      "Cassy Zeigler: That is a long time to go back and talk to people about Kristen.",
      "But prosecutors thought there was another piece of evidence that could bring them a guilty verdict.",
      "A JURY RULES",
      "Nearly four years have passed since Kristen Trickle died from a gunshot wound to her head.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How would you describe the last four years?",
      "Pastor Brant Rice: Hellish.",
      "On Sept. 22, 2023, it was Colby Trickle's last chance to convince a jury that he had nothing to do with his wife's death.",
      "He decided not to testify, but his attorney Cassy Zeigler called his mother Tina Kreutzer to the stand.",
      "JEESY ZEIGLER (in court): Is it fair to say that Kristen was pretty reserved at first when you met her?",
      "TINA KREUTZER: Yeah \u2026 very to herself.",
      "Kreutzer described her daughter-in-law as a woman who rarely revealed her feelings.",
      "TINA KREUTZER (in court): I couldn't read her, very, um, emotionless.",
      "It's a drastically different Kristen \u2014 says attorney Zeigler \u2014 than the one her family describes.",
      "Jessy Zeigler: \u2026 by their explanation, just the happiest, most joyful person \u2026 never stopped smiling. She almost is walking on water. I mean when the reality is we have no idea how she's really feeling \u2026 Now you find out he's having an emotional relationship with someone else online. I can imagine that being the last straw.",
      "But in his final argument to the jurors, prosecutor Aaron Cunningham shows them the weapon that killed Kristen, and says she couldn't have fired it.",
      "AARON CUNNINGHAM (in court): Members of the Jury, this doesn't add up. And the state is going to demonstrate it to you.",
      "Cunningham showed \"48 Hours\" with a similar gun.",
      "Aaron Cunningham: if you look at the autopsy photos \u2026 you see a little divot at the \u2026 3 o'clock mark (points under his chin with his left hand) which is believed by the coroner to be the site imprint of the gun. \u2026 And I knew Kristen was right-handed. \u2026 the natural way a right-handed person would hold a gun to their head for suicide \u2026 would be something like this or maybe something like this\u00a0 \u2026 Putting the sight mark somewhere between 9 o'clock and 6 o'clock. \u2026 So, for the site mark to have wound up over at the three o'clock angle would be very unnatural.",
      "Cunningham showed \"48 Hours\" how he believes Colby Trickle shot his wife while she slept next to him.",
      "Aaron Cunningham: It would be consistent with the placement of the site mark \u2026 that he would have grabbed the gun from his nightstand, rolled over in bed and placed the gun just underneath her chin and pulled the trigger.",
      "Erin Moriarty: So, if you keep it here (the gun at chest level coming from the right side), then this then would explain why it appears on her neck here (pointing to the left side of her chin).",
      "Aaron Cunningham: Correct.",
      "As the case went to the jury, Zeigler had hoped that they would still have too many doubts.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How significant is it \u2014 the fact that the coroner went to trial, still saying it was a suicide when the prosecutors are saying it's a homicide?",
      "Jessy Zeigler:\u00a0 Yeah, it's huge.",
      "Jessy Zeigler: We have to show doubt that's reasonable. And I think there's plenty of that.",
      "That's what Kristen Trickle's family feared as well.",
      "Pastor Brant Rice: All they have to do is convince one of those 12 that they have a reasonable doubt. \u2026 What are we going to do? \u2026 if he walks out a free man \u2026",

      "During this particular operation which ICE invited CBS News to view, the goal is to detain and deport three different immigrants they say are undocumented and were recently charged with a variety of crimes.",
      "\"We're working a lot more on our caseload now,\" Brian Acuna, an ICE deputy field officer involved with the operation, told CBS News. \"We're looking to take the worst of the worst off the streets.\"",
      "ICE\u00a0says these operations are a top priority, and they come as the new Trump administration has immediately intensified\u00a0efforts\u00a0to target illegal immigration and carry out\u00a0mass deportations. This week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said its immigration crackdown has resulted in more than 8,000 arrests since President Trump's inauguration.",
      "Steven Holfer, special agent in charge of the DEA's New Orleans Field Division, is happy to help, even if it means putting other tasks on hold. He says during the last two weeks, the DEA has been assisting ICE with its detention and deportation operations \"every day.\"",
      "The early-morning traffic stop in Metairie, Lousiana, just 20 minutes outside New Orleans, had been planned after careful surveillance, according to ICE agents on the operation. ICE agents detained one man charged with rape, as well as another man they say is undocumented who just happened to be in the car. ICE describes this type of arrest as \"collateral.\"",
      "\"If we encounter other folks as we do this, our supervisors are going to make case-by-case decisions,\" Acuna said.",
      "That worries 25-year-old Gracey, who asked CBS News to only use her first name for fear of retaliation. Originally from Honduras, she says she has committed no crime since crossing the border five years ago.",
      "Gracey has received some temporary protections to live and work in the U.S. while her immigration case is still pending.",
      "Her 3-year-old daughter is a U.S. citizen, but her 8-year-old daughter is undocumented. She tells CBS News she is afraid she will never see her children again if forced to leave the U.S.",
      "\"What is going to happen to my family?\" she asked. \"(If) I am going to be separated from my daughter, I don't have any options for her, that is my fear.\"",
      "Right now, there are more than 10,000 non-citizens living in New Orleans, according to the 2023 U.S. Census, and it's estimated that most are undocumented. But a Louisiana state law passed just last year bans the very policies that make New Orleans a sanctuary city, the only one in the Gulf states.",
      "Acuna says New Orleans' sanctuary city policies have been problematic for the ICE's New Orleans Field Office.",
      "\"All the other sheriffs are cooperative except for the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office,\" Acuna said. \"You don't have time to be frustrated, because ICE has to take our time and investigate and expend more resources to go back out into the community, and at times, arrest a person a second or a third time when the sheriff's office refuses to cooperate with our detainer.\"",
      "Acuna says they are evaluating their options to get better cooperation.",
      "\"We're working on it every day,\" Acuna said. \"This has been an issue here in this area since 2013.\"",
      "The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office declined an interview with CBS News, but Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams says the parish only cooperates with ICE in cases of undocumented immigrants accused of violent crimes. Williams sees New Orleans as continuing to follow sanctuary city policies.",
      "\"Yeah, I don't think the tolerance level, or the way that New Orleans shows love is going to change, simply because of a change in the administration,\" Williams said.",
      "Gracey hopes there's no change in being able to keep her family together, and despite everything, she says she still believes she is \"in the right place.\"",
      "\"Even though the system, part of the system, doesn't support us, they don't want us here, there are a lot of very good people here,\" Gracey said. \"And I feel like I'm in the right place.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2025 10:06:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Three more Israeli hostages were released Saturday in exchange for dozens of Palestinian prisoners.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli forces were withdrawing from a key Gaza corridor on Sunday, Israeli officials and Hamas said, part of Israel's commitments under a tenuous ceasefire deal with Hamas that is moving ahead but faces a major test over whether the sides can negotiate its planned extension.",
      "Israel agreed as part of the truce to remove its forces from the 4-mile (6-kilometer) Netzarim Corridor, a strip of land that bisects northern Gaza from the south that Israel used as a military zone during the war.",
      "At the start of the ceasefire last month, Israel began allowing Palestinians to cross Netzarim to head to their homes in the war-battered north, sending hundreds of thousands streaming across Gaza on foot and by car. The withdrawal of forces from the area fulfills another commitment to the deal, which paused the 15-month war.",
      "However, the sides appear to have made little progress on negotiating the deal's second phase, which is meant to extend the truce and lead to the release of more Israeli hostages held by Hamas.",
      "Three more Israeli hostages were released Saturday in exchange for dozens of Palestinian prisoners, the latest in the ceasefire deal that has so far seen 18 hostages freed in exchange for over 550 Palestinian prisoners. Negotiations over the second phase are underway.",
      "The hostage release comes amid American President Trump's comments last week that the U.S. will \"take over the Gaza Strip.\" The president said his decision about taking over Gaza \"was not a decision made lightly,\" and he claimed he's received praise from other leaders in the Middle East, though he did not identify any by name.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comments during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The comments have sent shockwaves through the diplomatic community, although Netanyahu at the time said \"it's worthwhile really pursuing this avenue,\" referring to the plan.",
      "Netanyahu this weekend sent a delegation to Qatar, a key mediator in talks between the sides, but the mission included low-level officials, sparking speculation that it won't lead to a breakthrough in extending the truce. Netanyahu is also expected to convene a meeting of key Cabinet ministers this week on the second phase of the deal.",
      "Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia affirmed its categorical rejection of remarks by Netanyahu last week about displacing Palestinians from their land, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Israeli officials have suggested the establishment of a Palestinian state on Saudi territory.",
      "Netanyahu appeared to be joking on Thursday when he responded to an interviewer on pro-Netanyahu Channel 14 who mistakenly said \"Saudi state\" instead of \"Palestinian state,\" before correcting himself. While the Saudi statement mentioned Netanyahu's name, it did not directly refer to the comments about establishing a Palestinian state in Saudi territory. Egypt and Jordan also condemned the Israeli suggestions, with Cairo deeming the idea as a \"direct infringement of Saudi sovereignty.\" The kingdom said it valued \"brotherly\" states' rejection of Netanyahu's remarks.",
      "Separately on Sunday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said that two women in their 20s, including one who was eight months pregnant, were fatally shot by Israeli gunfire in the northern occupied West Bank, where Israeli troops have been carrying out a broad operation.",
      "The ceasefire is fragile and its extension is not guaranteed",
      "Since it began on Jan. 19, the ceasefire deal has faced repeated obstacles and disagreements between the sides, underscoring its fragility. But it has held, raising hopes that the devastating war that led to seismic shifts in the Middle East may be headed toward an end.",
      "On Sunday, cars heaped with belongings, including water tanks and suitcases, were seen heading north through a road that crosses Netzarim. Under the deal, Israel is supposed to allow the cars to cross through uninspected, and there did not appear to be troops in the vicinity of the road.",
      "Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the withdrawal showed Hamas had \"forced the enemy to submit to our demands\" and that it thwarted \"Netanyahu's illusion of achieving total victory.\"",
      "The Israeli officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss troop movement with the media, did not disclose how many soldiers were withdrawing. Troops currently remain along Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt and a full withdrawal is expected to be negotiated in a later stage of the truce.",
      "During the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid to war-battered Gaza. The deal also stipulates that Israeli troops will pull back from populated areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim Corridor.",
      "In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a \"sustainable calm.\" But details beyond that are unclear and repeated stumbling blocks throughout the first phase and the deep mistrust between the sides have cast doubt on whether they can nail down the extension.",
      "The truce faces many challenges, including Trump's Gaza proposal",
      "Israel has said it won't agree to a complete withdrawal from Gaza until Hamas' military and political capabilities are eliminated. Hamas says it won't hand over the last hostages until Israel removes all troops from the territory.",
      "Netanyahu meanwhile is under heavy pressure from his far-right political allies to resume the war after the first phase so that Hamas, which carried out the deadliest attack on Israelis in their history, can be defeated. He is also facing pressure from Israelis who are eager to see more hostages return home and want to deal to continue, especially after the gaunt appearances of the three male captives freed on Saturday stunned the nation.",
      "Complicating things further is a proposal by Mr. Trump to relocate the population of Gaza and take ownership of the Palestinian territory. Israel has expressed openness to the idea while Hamas, the Palestinians and the broader Arab world have rejected it outright.",
      "The suggested plan is saddled with moral, legal and practical obstacles. But it may have been proposed as a negotiation tactic by Mr. Trump, to try to ratchet up pressure on Hamas or as an opening gambit in a bargaining process aimed at securing a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. That grand deal appeared to be rattled on Sunday as Saudi Arabia condemned remarks by Netanyahu who said Palestinians could create their state in that territory.",
      "Saudi Arabia said his remarks \"aim to divert attention from the successive crimes committed by the Israeli occupation against our Palestinian brothers in Gaza, including the ethnic cleansing they are being subjected to.\"",
      "In an interview Thursday with Israel's Channel 14, Netanyahu said: \"The Saudis can create a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia; they have a lot of land over there.\"",
      "Violence surges in the occupied West Bank",
      "The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' attack that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage, has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians according to Hamas-run Palestinian health authorities who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Vast parts of the territory have been obliterated in the fighting, leaving many Palestinians returning to damaged or destroyed homes.",
      "Violence has surged in the West Bank throughout the war and has intensified in recent days with an Israeli military operation in the north of the territory. The shooting of the pregnant woman, Sundus Shalabi, happened in the Nur Shams urban refugee camp, a focal point of Israeli operations against Palestinian militants in the territory. The Hamas-run Health Ministry said another woman, identified as Rahaf al-Ashqar, 21, was also killed there Sunday.",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz announced on Sunday the expansion of the Israeli military operation, which started in the city of Jenin several weeks ago. He said the operation was meant to prevent Iran from establishing a foothold in the occupied West Bank."

    "summary": "Sam Nujoma, the freedom fighter who became Namibia's founding president after leading the country to independence from apartheid South Africa, has died.",
    "story": [
      "Sam Nujoma, the first president of independent Namibia who led the country to freedom from apartheid South Africa in 1990, has died, Namibia's current leader announced Sunday. He was 95. Known as the father of his nation, Nujoma served for 15 years as Namibia's founding president, from 1990 until 2005.",
      "Namibian President Nangolo Mbumba said Nujoma died from an illness Saturday night after being hospitalized in the capital, Windhoek. He did not share specific details about Nujoma's health condition.",
      "\"The foundations of the Republic of Namibia have been shaken,\" Mbumba said in a statement. \"Over the past three weeks, the Founding President of the Republic of Namibia and Founding Father of the Namibian Nation was hospitalized for medical treatment and medical observation due to ill health.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, this time, the most gallant son of our land could not recover from his illness,\" Mbumba added. He said Nujoma \"provided maximum leadership to our nation and spared no effort to motivate each and every Namibian to build a country that would stand tall and proud among the nations of the world\" and praised him for marshaling the Namibian people through \"the darkest hours of our liberation struggle.\"",
      "A fiery anti-apartheid activist, Nujoma helped launch Namibia' liberation movement, called the South West Peoples' Organization, or SWAPO, in the 1960s, and went on to lead the country's lengthy battle for independence from South Africa.",
      "Nujoma was the last of a generation of African leaders who brought their countries out of colonial or white minority rule that included South Africa's Nelson Mandela, Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda, Tanzania's Julius Nyerere and Mozambique's Samora Machel.",
      "He was revered in his arid, sparsely populated homeland in southwest Africa as a charismatic father figure who steered it to democracy and stability after long colonial rule by Germany and a bitter war of independence from South Africa.",
      "He spent nearly 30 years in exile as the leader of Namibia's independence movement before returning for Parliamentary elections in late 1989, the first democratic vote in the country. He was elected president by lawmakers months later in 1990 as Namibia's independence was confirmed.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Nujoma led Namibia's independence movement \"against the seemingly unshakeable might of colonial and apartheid authorities and forces\" and spurred the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa on its own final steps to freedom.",
      "\"Sam Nujoma inspired the Namibian people to pride and resistance that belied the size of the population,\" Ramaphosa said. \"Namibia's attainment of independence from South Africa in 1990 ignited in us the inevitability of our own liberation.\"",
      "Many Namibians also credited Nujoma's leadership for the process of national reconciliation after the deep divisions caused by the independence war and South Africa's policies of dividing the country into ethnically based regional governments, with separate education and health care for each race.",
      "Even political opponents praised Nujoma \u2014 who was branded a Marxist and accused of ruthless suppression of dissent while in exile \u2014 for establishing a democratic Constitution and involving white businessmen and politicians in government after independence.",
      "Despite his pragmatism and nation-building at home, Nujoma often hit foreign headlines for his fierce anti-Western rhetoric. At a United Nations conference in Geneva in 2000, Nujoma stunned delegates when he claimed AIDS was a man-made biological weapon. He also occasionally waged a verbal war on homosexuality, calling gays \"idiots\" and branding homosexuality a \"foreign and corrupt ideology.\"",
      "He once banned all foreign television programs, declaring they had corrupted the youth of Namibia.",
      "Nujoma built ties with North Korea, Cuba, Russia and China, some of which had supported Namibia's liberation movement by providing arms and training.",
      "But he balanced that with outreach to the West, and Nujoma was the first African leader to be hosted at the White House by former U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1993. Clinton called Nujoma \"the George Washington of his country\" and \"a genuine hero of the world's movement toward democracy.\"",
      "Nujoma also advocated for the advancement of women in a largely patriarchal region, saying \"there is no shortage of competent and experienced African women to lead the way forward.\" Namibia elected its first female president last year and President-elect Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah's term is due to start next month.",
      "Nujoma grew up in a rural, impoverished family, the eldest of 11 children. His early life revolved around looking after cattle and the cultivation of land. He attended a mission school and worked in a general store and then a whaling station on the coast, before a job in Windhoek as a cleaner for South African Railways.",
      "He was arrested following a political protest in 1959 and fled the territory shortly after his release to go into exile in Tanzania. There, he helped establish the South West African People's Organization and was named its president in 1960. SWAPO has been Namibia's ruling party since 1990, and Nujoma ultimately led it for 47 years until stepping down in 2007.",
      "When South Africa refused to heed a 1966 U.N. resolution ending the mandate it had been given over the German colony of South West Africa after World War I, Nujoma launched SWAPO's guerrilla campaign.",
      "\"We started the armed struggle with only two sub-machine guns and two pistols,\" Nujoma once said. \"I got them from Algeria, plus some rounds of ammunition.\"",
      "SWAPO never achieved military victory in an independence war that lasted more than 20 years, but Nujoma won wide political support during his exile, leading to the U.N. declaring SWAPO the sole representative of the Namibian people and South Africa ultimately withdrawing from the country.",
      "As he mixed with world leaders, Nujoma was aware of his humble roots and lack of education. After leaving school early to work, he later attended night school, largely to improve his English. He said he dedicated his life to his country's liberation.",

More than 47,000 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, according to the local Hamas-run ministry of health.",
      "The release of the three male hostages followed the same choreography as previous releases: They were driven in white vans to a staged area where they were handed over to officials from the Red Cross. All three men looked very thin and frail.",

      "A French police officer has been ordered to pay 1,000 euros, or approximately $1,000 after he described a woman who filed a sexual assault complaint as a \"whore\", a source close to the case said on Saturday.",
      "In a case that sparked outrage in France, the woman, then 34, filed a complaint at a Paris police station in February 2022, saying she had been assaulted in the street after several drinks on a night out.",
      "A male police officer later called her on the phone to ask her to come back and finish the paperwork. After he left a message \u2014 thinking he had hung up \u2014 he started insulting her, calling her a \"whore\" three times.",
      "The case sparked indignation from activists, who said it reflected how many police officers treated victims of sexual violence.",
      "French statistics in 2017 showed that over 80,000 adult women face rape or attempted rape every year in the country but only 10% file a complaint, the Associated Press reported.",
      "But like many countries across the globe, the #MeToo movement prompted social and governmental changes in recent years. The number of reported cases of sexual violence has more than doubled from 2016 to 2023, according to French newspaper Le Monde.",
      "In a rare comment, France's then interior minister, Gerald Darmanin, said the 33-year-old officer should be fired.",
      "The policeman was charged with \"non-public insult because of gender\". But a French court cleared the policeman of criminal liability in January 2024. During the trial, the officer apologized and said he had to beg Darmanin to keep his job.",
      "The woman then appealed against the decision, asking judicial authorities to recognize the officer's misconduct.",
      "On Jan. 30, the Paris Court of Appeal sided with the woman and said the policeman should pay her 1,000 euros, according to a copy of the ruling obtained by AFP.",
      "The police officer repeatedly apologized for his remarks, but insisted that they were merely an expression of his annoyance at procedural irregularities.",
      "In its ruling, the court found that \"it cannot be disputed that the term 'la pute' (whore) repeated several times is offensive and was, in view of the context, aimed at (the plaintiff) because of her sex\".",
      "The woman's lawyer Arie Alimi said it was necessary \"to go all the way\" to draw attention to the bias \"towards victims of sexual and gender-based violence and towards victims of police officers\".",
      "A lawyer for the police officer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In the country's most recent high-profile case of sexual violence, the former husband of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who admitted to drugging and raping her repeatedly for almost a decade and inviting dozens of other men to assault her as well, was found guilty of aggravated rape.",
      "Forty-nine men whom Dominique Pelicot brought into his home to assault his wife were also convicted as part of the same landmark trial.",
      "Pelicot's case triggered protests across France, and there was hope among some demonstrators that the case could lead to changes in controversial French laws governing sexual consent.",

      "The government and the right-wing Sweden Democrats party said Friday that they planned to move forward with proposals to tighten gun laws, including restricting access to semi-automatic weapons such as the AR-15, Swedish news agency TT reported.",
      "Authorities said the shooter in Orebro had licenses for four weapons, three of which were found next to his body. Police have seized the fourth. Officials have only said at least one gun was a rifle-like weapon.",

    "story": [
      "Beijing\u00a0\u2014 China on Friday lashed out at what it called U.S. \"coercion\" after Panama declined to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing following Washington's threat to take back the Panama Canal. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a briefing that China \"firmly opposes the U.S. smearing and undermining the Belt and Road cooperation through means of pressure and coercion.\"",
      "The Belt and Road Initiative is President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy drive to bind China closer to countries in the region and beyond by building roads, railways, airports, power plants and other infrastructure.",
      "The program has completed some major projects but also raised concerns about debt and environmental impact.",
      "Panama's decision to walk away from it was seen as a concession to the U.S. over the canal after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Panamanian leader Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Sunday that Panama must immediately reduce what President Trump says is Chinese influence over the canal area or face potential retaliation from the United States.",
      "Mulino has rejected pressure from the new U.S. government to discuss ownership of a waterway that is vital to global trade. On Wednesday, Mulino vehemently rejected a claim issued the previous day by the U.S. State Department that a deal had been reached for U.S. military vessels to traverse the canal free of charge. Mulino said the U.S. statement was \"based on a falsity. And that's intolerable.\"",
      "Later Thursday, asked about Mulino's remarks, Rubio said he wasn't confused about his discussions with leaders in Panama, adding: \"I respect very much the fact that Panama has a process of laws and procedures that they need to follow.\"",
      "Why would Trump want Greenland and the Panama Canal?",
      "Why would Trump want Greenland and the Panama Canal?",
      "\"The United States has a treaty obligation to protect the Panama Canal if it comes under attack,\" Rubio said. \"That treaty obligation would have to be enforced by the armed forces of the United States, particularly the U.S. Navy. I find it absurd that we would have to pay fees to transit a zone that we are obligated to protect in a time of conflict.\"",
      "Despite Mulino's firm stance on Thursday, some believe Panama may be open to a compromise under which canal operations on both sides are taken away from the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports company, which was given a 25-year no-bid extension to run them. An audit into the suitability of that extension is already underway in Panama and could lead to a rebidding process.",
      "A drop in water levels in the canal due to drought has slowed transit through the canal, raising further complaints from Mr. Trump, although the delays appear to have nothing to do with China.",
      "Lin said the Belt and Road Initiative had brought \"active participation\" from over 150 countries and that it has brought \"fruitful results\" to Panama and China, but gave no examples.",

      "\"Warship on your course,\" he says. \"I am drifting. I'm not under command.\"",
      "The broadcast, according to military officials, came from a Russian spy ship, the Kildin, as the vessel packed with intelligence-gathering equipment drifted temporarily out of control off the Syrian coast on Jan. 23, with flames and black fumes rising from its smokestack.",
      "The Associated Press obtained audio of the broadcast, as well as video and photos showing the blaze, that three military officials said were gathered by a ship from a NATO nation operating nearby. The officials, also from a NATO country, spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the fire and radio transmission that Russian authorities haven't publicly reported.",
      "The audio provides an unusual peek inside Russia's fleet of spy ships that NATO nations are watching closely because of concerns that Moscow might sabotage underwater cables and pipelines amid tensions over the war in Ukraine. Even though the Kildin was in trouble, the secretive ship didn't respond to an offer of help from the NATO vessel, the officials said.",
      "The U.K. last month tracked another Russian vessel that it identified as a spy ship in the English Channel. The Defense Ministry said the Yantar \"was caught loitering over critical undersea infrastructure\" and that a Royal Navy submarine surfaced close to the ship \"to warn it had been secretly monitoring its every move.\"",
      "At the time, British Defense Secretary John Healey warned Russia's President Vladimir Putin: \"We know what you're doing.\"\u00a0 Healey said a Royal Navy submarine was authorized to surface close to the Yantar \"strictly as a deterrent measure\" and \"to make clear that we have been covertly monitoring its every move,\"\u00a0BBC News reported.",
      "Last month, the\u00a0Royal Navy revealed\u00a0that in late December the frigate HMS Somerset had tracked a Russian naval group as it sailed from the North Sea to the English Channel, although the group had stayed in international waters.",
      "Fire temporarily disables the ship",
      "The 55-year-old Kildin gathers intelligence on NATO activities in the Mediterranean and had been operating near naval exercises by alliance member Turkey before the fire, according to the officials who spoke to the AP.",
      "They said the blaze burned for at least four hours and that the Kildin's crew removed the covers from lifeboats though they never put them to sea.",
      "The Kildin also hoisted two black balls from its masts - a maritime signal that the ship can no longer steer, the officials said.",
      "They said the crew eventually regained control and that the Kildin is still stationed and gathering intelligence off the Syrian port of Tartus, accompanied by a frigate and a supply vessel. It is not clear what caused the blaze.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he wasn't aware of a fire aboard the Kildin and didn't say what the ship was doing at the time.",
      "He dismissed suggestions that it reflected poorly on Russian naval readiness. \"Assessing the state of the fleet based on the breakdown of one particular ship or one particular malfunction is not professional,\" Peskov said.",
      "Retired Vice Adm. Michel Olhagaray, a former head of France's center for higher military studies, said that even though the Kildin regained steering, the fire highlights the logistical difficulties for Russia of maintaining naval forces in the Mediterranean, far from its bases in the Arctic and the Baltic Sea.",
      "Moscow also is no longer able to use its Black Sea Fleet for Mediterranean patrols because during the Ukraine war Turkey isn't allowing warships to pass through the Bosporus, which links the Black and Mediterranean seas.",
      "\"The maintenance of this Russian fleet, particularly in the Mediterranean, is extraordinarily complex,\" Olhagaray said.",
      "Audio captures radio exchanges",
      "The audio gathered by the NATO ship is a 75-second radio exchange between the Kildin and a Togo-flagged cargo ship, Milla Moon, the officials said.",
      "The AP also obtained a second recording of conversations among crew members aboard the NATO ship. In that, they can be heard identifying the exchange they've just monitored as being between the Kildin and a Togolese vessel. Military officials provided both recordings to the AP, which was not able to independently authenticate them.",
      "Ship-tracking websites that use the data vessels emit on their identity, position, speed and course show the Milla Moon lifted anchor off Tartus and started cruising northward along Syria's coast on Jan. 23. That was the day of the Kildin fire, also in waters off Tartus, the military officials said.",
      "They said the Kildin at first identified itself to the Milla Moon as another ship, the Sky, and then asked to switch channels to continue the conversation.",
      "After the switch, the man with accented English is then heard identifying his vessel as a warship.",
      "\"Motor vessel Milla Moon, this is warship on your course,\" the voice can be heard saying on the clip. \"Please hear me.\"",
      "He asks the Milla Moon to steer clear.",
      "\"I am drifting. I'm not under command,\" he says.",

    "summary": "Paris' centuries-old Louvre Museum \u2014 home of da Vinci's iconic Mona Lisa \u2014 is getting an $800 million makeover, and American visitors will have to help pay for it.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 It is the most visited museum in the world, but management, staff and visitors agree the iconic Louvre in Paris \u2014 the home of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa\u00a0\u2014 is in need of some serious TLC.",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" Louvre Museum director Laurence des Cars acknowledged to CBS News. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "But it's also an issue of upkeep. The last major renovation of the museum was more than three decades ago, when renowned architect I.M. Pei's now-iconic glass pyramid was added to serve as the main entrance.",
      "When that entrance was inaugurated in 1989, however, the architects were planning for about 4 million visitors per year. Last year, the Louvre drew 9 million people, and officials hope to see that annual footfall rise to 12 million in the years ahead.",
      "To allow for that increase, French President Emmanuel Macron last month announced an ambitious 10-year plan to refurbish and expand the museum. The plans include establishing a new entrance on the east side of the building, to help manage the flow of visitors.",
      "It will become the main entrance, as the pyramid is simply too small to cope with the current number of visitors, let alone the anticipated increase. The access point is small, space below it is limited, and in the summer it gets very hot under all the glass. The Louvre Pyramid will continue to be a visitor access point, however.",
      "The new entrance will open onto the museum's eastern courtyard, the Cour Carr\u00e9e, and the plan is to expand downwards, building new galleries underneath it. One of those galleries has been earmarked as a new home for the Louvre's most famous piece, the Mona Lisa.",
      "If you ask the people standing in line outside the museum what they're most looking forward to seeing, the vast majority will reply \"the Mona Lisa.\"",
      "Carlos from San Diego didn't even hesitate: \"I always wanted to see it, ever since I was little,\" he told CBS News. \"I'm a big fan and this is one of the things that I look forward to.\"",
      "\"You can never get enough of it,\" said Ella, visiting from Canada, who had already been to the Louvre on several previous visits to Paris.",
      "But once inside the room where Mona Lisa currently lives, her global allure means crowds jostling to catch a glimpse of her mysterious face. The painting's relatively small size often comes as a shock to visitors, some of whom are left using the zoom function on their smartphone cameras to get a closer look.",
      "Da Vinci's masterpiece is in the Salle des \u00c9tats, the largest room in the Louvre. It is also home to major works by the Venetian masters Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese, which often go ignored. The remarkable piece, The Wedding Feast at Cana, by Veronese, fills the back wall, facing the Mona Lisa. But visitors often walk straight past it without even seeing it.",
      "\"She's a sort of universal masterpiece,\" says des Cars. \"People want to spend time with her, and that's okay. And we need to organize that. But the Louvre is filled with 1,000 Mona Lisas.\"",
      "She says one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre\".",
      "Des Cars believes the new main entrance will also link the museum to the city around it in a more concrete way. \"The Pyramid is a wonderful, wonderful piece of architecture,\" she says. \"But it is a bit isolated in Paris, not in direct contact with the city. The eastern entrance will allow us to connect directly to the city, and so we think it's a perfect balance for this extraordinary building.\"",
      "The ambitious refurbishment will take a total of 10 years: Six years for the expansion and another four for vital repairs to the building and upgrades to outdated technical installations. The security system will also be updated to accommodate the ever-increasing numbers who pass through the museum's doors.",
      "The project is expected to cost around $800 million. Macron promised that French taxpayers would not have to foot the bill - although government funds will cover the $10 million cost of the initial surveys and plans.",
      "To help pay for all the work, ticket pricing will change \u2014 and visitors from outside the European Union will have to pay more from next year. French and European taxes help fund public cultural institutions, so the argument is that they are already paying on top of the entry ticket, unlike visitors from farther afield.",
      "\"It's not to discourage international tourism or to punish anyone, but it's the reality of the economy,\" said des Cars.",
      "The Louvre has also launched a fundraising drive, hoping the museum's stature will open purse strings around the world, so that it can continue to hold on to its number one spot, while adapting to the times.",

      "Mulino said he had told U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Wednesday that he could neither set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them and that he was surprised by the U.S. State Department's statement suggesting otherwise late Wednesday.",
      "\"I completely reject that statement yesterday,\" Mulino said during his weekly press conference, adding that he had asked Panama's ambassador in Washington to dispute the State Department's statement.",
      "On Wednesday evening, the U.S. State Department said in a social media post: \"U.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the U.S. government millions of dollars a year.\" The department had no immediate comment Thursday on Mulino's remarks.",
      "The Panama Canal Authority put out its own terse statement later Wednesday night saying it had \"not made any adjustments\" to the fees, adding that it was \"willing to establish a dialogue with the pertinent officials from the United States in regards to the transit of U.S. Navy ships.\"",
      "Mulino said the U.S. statement \"really surprises me because they're making an important, institutional statement from the entity that governs United States foreign policy under the president of the United States based on a falsity. And that's intolerable.\"",
      "The differing versions came just days after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino and canal administrators and visited the critical trade route. He had carried a message from President Trump that China's influence at the canal was unacceptable, as the Trump administration makes a push for U.S. control of the canal, which it says it needs for America's economic security.",
      "The Panama Canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. And although the U.S. led the construction of the major waterway that around 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic now moves through, its control was given to Panama in 1999.",
      "In their meeting, Rubio told the Panamanian leader that Mr. Trump had determined that China's influence on the canal constituted \"a threat to the canal and represents a violation of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Mulino has refuted those claims, and he said Thursday that both Panama's constitution and laws regulating the Canal Authority make clear that neither the government nor the authority can waive fees.",

Essential to that progress, Sierra Leone's civil service advocates believe, is nurturing democracy and human rights.

Almost all of the agency's workers are being put on leave.",
      "\"It came as a shock, and devastating,\" said Fatorma\u00a0from his office in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital. He added the loss created \"a gap\" in funding and a \"vacuum in governance\" that he said Russia or China could rush to fill.",
      "USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations in 2023, according to the Congressional Research Service, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.

The work of\u00a0Cambodia's Chab Dai, a USAID-funded survivor support program, has been put on hold, affecting nine staff members and dozens of survivors, Freedom Collaborative said.",
      "The situation is especially dire for groups in Latin America, the newsletter said, including an organization in Ecuador that had to let go of 11 staff members working with migrants and trafficked individuals, and groups in Colombia that had to halt all their operations.",
      "Funding for this type of complex work \u2014 often done at great personal risk to local staff and victims \u2014 is already very difficult to secure. Often, the U.S. government would be the only donor willing to provide funds, Macher said. She stressed that the benefits of these programs reach far beyond the individuals receiving assistance.",
      "\"It helps with global stability, and that is the larger argument,\" she said. \"The work helps reduce organized crime. And if there is no response or watching these crime groups, they can start expanding, and that is very scary because then it's a ripple effect. It's not just about the humanitarian aspect.\"",

      "A U.S. military plane carrying 104 deported Indian migrants arrived in the northern Indian city of Amritsar Wednesday, the first such flight to the country as part of a crackdown on undocumented migrants ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "The U.S. Department of Defense confirmed that an Air Force C-17 plane was used for the flight.",
      "Multiple Indian lawmakers alleged Thursday in parliament that the deportees' arms and legs were shackled during the entire journey, and the legislature was forced to adjourn proceedings as they disrupted the chamber with their chants.",
      "\"We are protesting precisely this issue \u2014 that the manner in which the U.S. did what they did was really unacceptable,\" Shashi Tharoor, a member of parliament with the Indian National Congress, told reporters Thursday. \"We believe they have a legal right to deport people who are illegally in their country. And if they are proven to be Indian nationals, we have a legal obligation to admit them, to accept them in our country. But the manner in which it was done, in handcuffs, squeezed into a military aircraft, in such an abrupt manner, is not acceptable.\"",
      "Daler Singh, one of the deported migrants, was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying: \"Our hands and legs were cuffed throughout\u2026 They did not unlock our cuffs even when we ate.\"",

      "The U.S. deported more than 1,000 Indian migrants last year, but on commercial flights and without any reports of alleged mistreatment. It is standard practice for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to restrain adult deportees on flights out of the country, which the agency argues is to protect inflight security and the migrants themselves, by preventing riots and other safety issues.",
      "At the request of certain countries, ICE agents will remove the restraints after deportees arrive in their home countries, and before they deplane.",

    "story": [
      "Cambridge, England \u2014 Scientists have long said cutting methane emissions is key to addressing climate change, but many big industries aren't readily able to curb their production of the harmful greenhouse gas. A British company says it has an answer: Turn methane into something else.",
      "Methane is a menace. Climate scientists say the invisible gas warms the Earth's atmosphere 84 times faster than carbon dioxide. It's released into the atmosphere by organic material, such as food waste, rotting at landfill sites, sewage treatment facilities and by the digestive systems of cows.",
      "Levidian \u2014 a climate tech business in Cambridge, England \u2014 set out to tackle this climate change challenge, by giving methane a makeover.",

      "The technology uses microwave energy and a special nozzle system to split methane molecules into the gas' component parts \u2014 hydrogen and carbon \u2014 and captures them.",
      "Hydrogen is increasingly sought after, as it can be used to power factories, trucks, ships and other machinery. Levidian said it's a clean fuel, because, when burned, it yields heat and energy, but the only emission is water vapor, no carbon dioxide.",
      "The carbon from the broken-down methane, meanwhile, falls into the hopper as a solid called graphene, which has been known to science for only about two decades and which is often touted as the strongest material in the world.",
      "Dr. Ellie Galanis, head of commercial development at Levidian, was keen to show off a harvest of graphene from the LOOP hopper at the company's lab.",

      "\"When you put graphene into the tire tread, you can make it stronger. You can make it last longer and you can make it more fuel efficient,\" she said of one application.",
      "They have also tried adding it to concrete.",
      "\"Without graphene, it tends to crumble a lot easier, but with graphene it's much stronger,\" she said.",
      "The super-strong but flexible material can even be included in the manufacture of medical gloves.",
      "\"When surgeons do the 'snap test,' they're trying to check if it will break, and that doesn't happen when you add graphene in \u2014 it makes them much stronger and more puncture resistant,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Scientists say graphene also helps boost battery life in electric vehicles, and it can be mixed into plastic to help manufactures use less petroleum-derived materials in their bottles.",
      "Researchers only discovered graphene 20 years ago, at the University of Manchester, and Levidian sees years of growth ahead for the product.",
      "\"When you get in your car, you will have graphene enhanced tires that last longer. The battery in that car, if it's electric, will take you further because it will have more capacity to charge faster, and the concrete you use in the building you go into will be more durable and have a smaller carbon footprint,\" she predicted, adding that even \"the clothes that you wear might have graphene in them so they're more sustainable.\"",

      "In a letter to the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior and the Office of Management and Budget, Schiff noted that Trump's hiring freeze issued on Jan. 20 had stopped the onboarding of thousands of seasonal firefighters that could harm readiness to respond to wildfires, as Southern California is still grappling with the aftermath of last month's wildfires.",
      "\"The memo issued on January 20 states that it does not apply to positions related to public safety, but this onboarding delay is directly contrary to that claim,\" Schiff said in the letter dated Friday. \"Our constituents and communities rely on the hard work and sacrifice of our more than 15,000 seasonal federal wildland firefighters each year.\"",

      "\"In the face of increasingly destructive wildfires, we cannot afford to diminish the tools at our disposal to fight these fires,\" Schiff said in his letter. \"Impeding the onboarding of federal firefighters and encouraging the early retirement of others, threatens California\u2019s firefighting capacity and puts communities at great risk.

The group said that Trump\u2019s actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters breached the U.S. Capitol, violated a clause in the 14th Amendment that prevents officers of the United States, members of Congress or state legislatures who \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\" against the Constitution from holding political office.",

      "1. Review app permissions:\u00a0Most apps request access to data they do not actually need. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. Disable access to location, microphone, contacts and other sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.",
      "2. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Many companies track your online activity to show targeted ads. You can limit this by disabling ad personalization in\u00a0Google,\u00a0Facebook, and other accounts. This reduces the amount of data collected about your interests and behavior.",
      "3. Limit social media tracking:\u00a0Social media platforms track your activity even when you are not using them.\u00a0Adjust privacy settings to restrict data collection.",
      "4. Avoid signing in with Google or Facebook:\u00a0Many websites offer login options using Google or Facebook. While convenient, this shares even more data with these platforms. Instead, create separate accounts using email whenever possible.",
      "5. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and private browsing mode:\u00a0A\u00a0VPN hides your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity, making it harder for websites to track you. Combined with private browsing or incognito mode, this reduces the amount of data companies can collect about your online activity. Using a VPN service can also enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi.",
      "While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",

Instead of downloading standalone apps, try using the browser versions of popular social media platforms, as they typically have fewer permissions.",

      "However, web tracking still exists through cookies and fingerprinting, so using a\u00a0privacy-focused browser like Brave, Firefox with enhanced tracking protection, or Safari with Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) can further reduce data collection. However, some apps are so deeply integrated that replacing them is difficult. For example, if you use an Android phone, avoiding Google\u2019s ecosystem is nearly impossible. Apple, on the other hand, offers more privacy controls, giving users better options to limit data collection.",

      "The healthcare industry has recently been a major target for hackers. You might remember the 2024 Ascension attack, which led to significant disruptions.",
      "The Change Healthcare breach was also on a massive scale. UnitedHealth initially\u00a0claimed that 100 million Americans were affected, but later\u00a0raised that number to 190 million.",
      "There have been countless other incidents, and now you can add another to the list. Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC), a Connecticut-based federally qualified health center, has disclosed a data breach following a criminal cyberattack on its systems.",

      "What You Need to Know",
      "Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC)\u00a0detected a data breach on Jan. 2 after identifying unusual activity within its computer systems. An investigation confirmed that a skilled hacker had accessed and extracted data but did not delete or lock any information. If CHC's claims are accurate, this is a positive outcome, as hackers often deploy ransomware, a type of attack in which they lock systems and demand payment before restoring access.",
      "In a\u00a0regulatory filing with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s Office, CHC said that 1,060,936 people were affected by the data breach. The type of information compromised varies depending on an individual\u2019s relationship with CHC. Patient data that may have been accessed includes names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, diagnoses, treatment details, test results, Social Security numbers and health insurance information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "For individuals who are not regular CHC patients but received COVID-19 services at a CHC clinic, the breached data may include names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, addresses, gender, race, ethnicity and insurance details if provided. Additional information, such as test dates, results and vaccine details, including type, dose and administration date, may also have been affected. In rare cases, Social Security numbers were also included in the breach.",
      "The organization did not disclose how the hackers gained access to the data or whether proper cybersecurity measures were in place at the time of the breach. While CHC has assured that its systems are no longer at risk, the same cannot be said for its patients, who may now be targets of various cyberattacks.",

      "CHC said the hacker\u2019s access was terminated within hours, and daily operations were not disrupted. To strengthen cybersecurity, CHC claims it has implemented advanced monitoring software and reinforced system protections. The organization said there is no evidence at this time that the compromised data has been misused.",
      "The health center is offering free identity theft protection services for all patients and COVID-19 service recipients whose Social Security numbers were involved in the breach.

      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "6 ways to protect yourself from Change Healthcare data breach",
      "1. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0The breach has exposed sensitive personal data, making it essential to reduce your online footprint. While no service can guarantee complete data removal, a reputable data removal service can significantly limit your exposure. These services systematically monitor and erase your personal information from numerous websites and data brokers.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With addresses among the compromised data, scammers may exploit this breach to send fraudulent letters. Be aware of mail claiming\u00a0missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Always verify the authenticity of such communications before responding or taking action.",
      "3. Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Scammers may use your compromised email or phone number to target you with\u00a0phishing attacks. Be wary of messages asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. To protect yourself, ensure strong antivirus software is installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, regular monitoring of your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts is critical. Look for unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity, and report any issues immediately to your bank or credit card provider.",
      "5. Recognize and report a Social Security scam:\u00a0If your Social Security number is exposed, you could become a target for related scams. Official communication regarding Social Security issues usually comes via mail, not phone calls or emails. Learn more about spotting and reporting scams by visiting the Social Security Administration\u2019s\u00a0scam information page.",
      "6. Invest in identity theft protection: Data breaches happen every day, and most never make the headlines, but with an identity theft protection service, you\u2019ll be notified if and when you are affected. An identity theft protection service can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The CHC breach may not be as large as the UnitedHealth attack, but with over a million individuals affected, it\u2019s still a serious incident. Cybercriminals can exploit stolen data in various ways, from identity theft to targeted phishing scams. While CHC has taken steps to secure its systems, those impacted should remain vigilant. Be wary of unexpected emails, calls or messages requesting personal information, and consider monitoring financial and medical accounts for any suspicious activity.",

      "Pine cones have these amazing scales that respond to moisture. When it's damp, they close up tight. But when it's warm and dry, they open wide to release their seeds. This simple yet effective mechanism has inspired scientists to develop a smart window system that could change the way we think about energy efficiency in buildings.",

      "Scientists from Germany's universities of Stuttgart and Freiburg have developed what is known as the\u00a0Solar Gate window facade system. It's like having tiny pinecones built right into your windows. These smart windows have special elements that curl up when it's cool and moist, letting in sunlight to warm your home. But when it's hot and dry, they flatten out to block the sun and keep things cool inside.",
      "Solar Gate window facade system (ICD/IntCDC University of Stuttgart)",
      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How it works",
      "The Solar Gate system consists of a gridded array of pine-cone-scale-inspired self-bending elements housed between two panes of glass in an aluminum-frame window unit. Each element is ingeniously crafted with three distinct layers, each serving a unique purpose. The bottom layer is composed of a cellulose powder and a thermoplastic blend that swells when exposed to moisture. Above this lies a middle layer made of thermoplastic, which remains unaffected by moisture.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The top layer consists of flexible biocomposite filaments that serve to hold the entire structure together. When exposed to moist air, the bottom layer expands, causing the element to curl upwards. Conversely, in dry conditions, it returns to its flattened state. This simple yet effective mechanism allows the window to respond automatically to changing weather conditions, providing optimal shading and light penetration as needed.",

In a comprehensive year-long study, researchers installed 424 Solar Gate elements in the south-facing skylight of a research building at the University of Freiburg. The results of this extensive trial were nothing short of impressive.",
      "During the cool, wet winter months, the elements responded by curling upwards, allowing ample sunlight to penetrate the building. This natural response effectively warmed and illuminated the interior spaces, reducing the need for artificial heating and lighting. Conversely, as the seasons changed and brought warmer, drier summer conditions, the elements automatically flattened out.",
      "This flattening action served to block excess sunlight, effectively keeping the building's interior cool and comfortable without the need for energy-intensive air conditioning. The test demonstrated the system's ability to autonomously adapt to changing weather conditions, providing optimal comfort and energy efficiency throughout the year.",

For instance, studies have investigated the development of shading systems using wooden slats that can open and close in response to environmental conditions.",
      "In the realm of textiles, scientists are working on \"smart\" clothing fabrics that can adapt to ambient temperature, providing optimal comfort for wearers. Perhaps most intriguingly, these principles are even being applied to the field of robotics, with researchers developing tiny mobile robots that can respond to environmental stimuli in ways inspired by natural mechanisms.

      "A new era of transportation",
      "Whoosh isn't your typical gondola or cable car system. While it may look similar at first glance, this clever Kiwi invention offers a unique blend of on-demand service, direct routing and privacy that sets it apart from traditional public transportation. Unlike fixed-route gondolas, Whoosh pods are equipped with their own motors and autonomous navigation systems. This allows them to freely traverse a complex network of cables and rails, choosing the most efficient path from one point to another without intermediate stops.",

      "How Whoosh works",
      "The Whoosh system combines the best aspects of ride-sharing and public transport. Users can book a pod through an app, much like calling an Uber. The pod will be waiting at a nearby station, ready to whisk you away to your destination. These stations are designed with minimal footprint, fitting into a standard car park space and featuring a spiral ramp up to the network height of about 40 feet above the ground. Larger stations can be built at ground level, offering easy access for passengers.",
      "The network itself consists of tensioned cables spanning 500-985 feet, interspersed with shorter sections of steel rail for smooth turns and junctions. This design allows Whoosh to overcome geographical obstacles with ease, crossing rivers, highways or even connecting rooftops.",

      "Speed, efficiency and comfort",
      "Whoosh pods are expected to achieve an average speed of 25 mph across the network. While this may not sound impressive at first, the non-stop nature of the journey means it could be significantly faster than driving through congested urban areas. The system features remarkable efficiency, using less energy for a standard ride than a 10-minute shower. This is achieved through constant motion and low rolling resistance, making Whoosh about twice as efficient as a small electric car. Comfort hasn't been overlooked either. The pods can lean into corners, much like a motorcycle, providing a smooth ride even at higher speeds. The cable sections of the journey offer an especially pleasant \"floating\" sensation.",

Nestled between mountains and a lake, Queenstown suffers from limited road networks and significant traffic congestion, making it a perfect proving ground for Whoosh's innovative transportation solution. The pilot project will demonstrate the system's ability to navigate difficult terrain and provide efficient transit in a compact urban environment, with Chris Allington noting that the location is \"small enough that it's actually solvable\" while presenting unique geographical challenges.",

Sketchy ticket resellers flood search results and social media with deals that seem too good to be true. Online ticket fraud is becoming increasingly common. While some tickets may be legitimate, many are not, with fans spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars for nothing.",
      "Scammers often utilize automation and artificial intelligence to identify and target potential victims based on the language used in their posts. For instance, scammers search for popular buzzwords and hashtags that people use when looking to buy tickets, such as #SuperBowl, #SuperBowlTickets or #LookingForTickets. They then respond to these posts with messages that contain links to other platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram or Cash App, where they attempt to finalize fraudulent deals.",

These scams appear everywhere, promising fans exclusive giveaways if they cover a small shipping fee or provide personal details. The posts look official, sometimes even using fake endorsements from players or teams, making them easy to fall for.",
      "Scammers also use cross-platform operations to evade detection and bans by social media platforms. They will identify and initiate communications with you on one social media platform before requesting you switch to another. This is likely an attempt to prevent one social media platform from gaining full insight into fraudulent activity and banning accounts.",

They may state they just want to sell the tickets \"last minute\" to justify large, attractive discounts, such as 50% off or more. They may also claim to have a personal or professional reason for not being able to attend the event, such as a family emergency or a work conflict.

Dave Lewis, Global Advisory CISO at\u00a01Password, shared some tips on staying safe leading up to the games. These are not complicated strategies, just simple cybersecurity practices that are easy to follow.",
      "1) Buy tickets from trusted sources:\u00a0Only purchase from official sites/apps and other reputable channels. Double-check URLs to avoid lookalike sites (which are designed to mimic legitimate event pages). Platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Eventbrite and Nextdoor are also hot spots for scams, so be cautious of sellers \"requiring a deposit\" through peer-to-peer financial apps like Cash App, Venmo or Zelle.",
      "2) Watch out for event-related phishing attacks: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Cybercriminals often time their phishing attacks around large events like the Super Bowl, offering fake discount tickets, VIP experiences, free food vouchers, etc. Always verify offers through the event\u2019s official website or app and never agree to anything over the phone. Double-check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over links before clicking to ensure they lead to legitimate event sites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Keep your phone software and apps updated:\u00a0Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system (i.e., iOS, macOS, Windows, Android, others). \"While constant notifications can be an annoyance at the moment, these updates are essential for keeping your devices secure,\" Lewis said. If you\u2019re not sure how to get started,\u00a0check out this extensive guide on how to update all your devices.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Create complex passwords for all your accounts, especially those related to ticket purchases or event information. Use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store these securely. Enable\u00a02FA wherever possible, particularly for email and payment accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. For the Super Bowl, this is especially crucial for any official NFL or ticketing apps you might be using.",
      "5) Be wary of QR codes:\u00a0While convenient, QR codes can be exploited by hackers for malicious purposes. Only scan QR codes from trusted sources, such as the official event organizer. If unsure, check for signs of tampering, like stickers placed over legitimate codes or poor print quality. When in doubt, don\u2019t scan it. As a precaution, always keep your antivirus software running to prevent malware infections from scanning a scam QR code.\u00a0If you don\u2019t have antivirus software, check out my top recommendations here.",
      "6) Beware of scammers using social engineering techniques: For example, they may encourage you to transfer money immediately as they allegedly have other prospective buyers. They may also use emotional appeals, such as sympathy, guilt or urgency, to manipulate you into making a decision. Scammers often use these tactics to pressure victims into paying before verifying the tickets.",
      "7) Be wary of individuals showing receipts or proof of purchase: This is not a guarantee that an individual is in possession of a ticket, and it can be easily faked.\u00a0Scammers can use fake receipts to convince victims that they bought the tickets from legitimate sources, such as Ticketmaster, StubHub or SeatGeek.",
      "8) Exercise caution when interacting with individuals asking for you to \"name your price\" or are selling below ticket value: This may be a sign that they are trying to lure you into a scam with a too-good-to-be-true offer. Scammers often use this strategy to attract victims who are looking for cheap or affordable tickets.",
      "9)\u00a0Be cautious when interacting with people claiming to sell tickets on behalf of a friend or family member: This may provide an excuse for scammers using compromised bank accounts with the account holder's name different from the social media account being used. Scammers often use this pretext to explain the discrepancy between the names on the accounts.",
      "10)\u00a0Review the account\u2019s recent history: Some scammers may claim to be selling tickets to multiple high-profile events, such as sports games, music concerts and conferences at one time. This may indicate that they are running a large-scale scam operation and are not genuine sellers. Scammers often post multiple ads for different events on the same or different platforms, using the same or similar images and descriptions.",
      "11) Exercise caution and validate ownership: Do this even when purchasing items from friends or friends of friends on social media. A family member or friend\u2019s account can be compromised and used by a scammer. Friends of the victim can vouch for the account user as a legitimate seller, not realizing the account had been hacked.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers are always looking for new ways to take advantage of football fans, especially during major events like the Super Bowl. Whether it is fake ticket sales, phishing scams or bogus giveaways, the risks are real. You can easily avoid becoming a victim of these types of attacks by staying vigilant and being cautious of emails and links that ask for personal information.",

      "The Secret Service falls under the purview of the Department of Homeland Security. Asked if she'd had sufficient time to get into the department and investigate the lapses leading up to the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, Noem told \"Fox News Sunday\" host Shannon Bream that DHS was \"moving in the right direction,\" while stressing that hundreds of other DHS personnel outside Secret Service alone would be deployed during the game.",
      "\"And I'm proud of Secret Service and all the work that they do every day. They make incredible sacrifices to keep people safe, and on the investigative side, have a lot of that training as well,\" Noem said. \"But for this event, we've deployed many other assets as well. We're obviously working with the local authorities, with the governor and with his agencies that he has that he's detailed to this.\"",
      "\"But we have several different agencies under the Department of Homeland Security that have put hundreds of individuals, investigators and military police folks that are used to these kinds of crowd control and security operations in their other departments that are focused on today to make sure that this big event is going to be safe and that we're going to make the right decisions in these situations that could arise and get everybody home safely,\" Noem added.",

      "The Super Bowl is being hosted in New Orleans, just a month after the New Year's Day terrorist truck-ramming attack against Bourbon Street revelers killed 14 victims and injured 35 others. The Super Bowl is DHS's largest event of the year. Noem was asked what changes there are as far as security preparations, now that Trump will be in attendance at the Superdome in New Orleans to watch the two-time defending champion Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles.",
      "\"It is so special that the president, the first time in history is going to the Super Bowl,\" Noem said. \"So, while we have been focused on security operations there for many, many months and have been preparing for this day, to have President Trump be there just amplifies the message that a great game means that everybody got to go celebrate, support their team and leave and get home safely.\"",
      "On Friday, Trump told the New York Post that he ordered the Secret Service to hand him \"every bit of information\" known about his two would-be assassins, Thomas Crooks and Ryan Routh.",
      "\"No more holding back because of Biden,\" Trump reportedly said. \"I\u2019m entitled to know. And they held it back long enough.\"",

      "Beyond the ground response, Noem said DHS also had regulations in the air regarding drone traffic, as well as cybersecurity operations to monitor online activity.",
      "\"We will be utilizing different agencies and departments under the umbrella of Homeland Security, but President Trump has also made a commitment for us to be able to deploy other assets from other departments and agencies, and I appreciate the flexibility that he has given us to make sure that we're addressing this even in a way that we see as responsive coming forward,\" Noem said. \"We're grateful for that interagency support, and I believe that it is unprecedented.\"",
      "\"This Super Bowl exemplifies how we come together to safeguard our traditions,\" Noem said. \"How we come together to make sure the public is well-informed and gets to celebrate something that's very special to us \u2013 to our culture, to our people and to our families. But we also do it in a way that's reactive to what we see as the current environment that we see in the world today. The world is a much more dangerous place, but here in the homeland, we are safe.\"",

      "Last month, the United Nations (U.N.) released its \"Action Plan to Enhance Monitoring and Response to Antisemitism,\" partially in response to a \"surge in antisemitic incidents targeting Jews and Jewish institutions in Europe, the United States of America and elsewhere.",
      "Anne Bayefsky, the director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and the president of Human Rights Voices, told Fox News Digital that the Action Plan was a \"phony exercise in futility,\" that was \"produced by what she claimed is the leading global purveyor of antisemitism\u2026to pretend to do something to combat antisemitism.\"",
      "Developed by the U.N. Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), the U.N.'s Action Plan emphasizes that \"the ability to understand and identify antisemitism is crucial to global efforts to combat hatred and prejudice.\" Despite the critical nature of understanding antisemitism, the plan wholly fails to define what constitutes antisemitism.",
      "The Action Plan mentions, but does not adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, which 45 member states have endorsed and which Bayefsky said \"the vast majority of major Jewish organizations and institutions around the world accept,\" because it \"recognizes the connection with Zionism and Israel.\"",

      "UNAOC Director Nihal Saad was asked by Fox News Digital why the Action Plan does not define antisemitism and whether lacking this definition would hinder efforts to identify and curtail anti-Jewish prejudice.",
      "Saad said that \"the Action Plan underlines the importance of understanding antisemitism rather than focusing on the definition of antisemitism and entering into a debate about it, which proved distracting from the real goal here, which is enhancing our responses to antisemitism.\"",
      "Referencing other issues where there is no consensus over \"definition of the subject matter,\" Saad explained that a lack of a \"definitive agreement among member states on the definition of terrorism\" had not hindered the development of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which Saad called \"a unique global instrument to enhance national, regional and international efforts to counter terrorism.\"",

      "Though he said that some U.N. efforts to counter terrorism are effective, he said that given the lack of agreement over what constitutes terrorism, the U.N. particularly struggles with identifying groups like Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis as terrorists. \"If something really dramatic happens, then often a group will find it is being accused of being a terrorist group,\" Fitton-Brown said, noting how the U.N. condemned the Houthis in the aftermath of their 2022 attack on Abu Dhabi airport but failed to designate them as a terror group. \"On Hezbollah, the U.N. has been hopelessly weak,\" he explained.",
      "He said that Hamas was \"a good example of where the absence of a definition is problematic because you get something like the 10/7 attack\u2026and the U.N. just completely failed in its response to that, and that is partly because of its failure to judge that a group that adopts terrorist tactics is a terrorist group.\"",
      "Bayefsky said that the U.N. Security Council \"has never condemned Hamas for October 7th because they can\u2019t agree on what counts as terrorism. That isn\u2019t a success story. It\u2019s a malevolent dereliction of duty.\"",

      "His remarks follow multiple reports that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a closed-door meeting of business leaders last week that the Trump administration \u201ckeep[s] talking about absorbing us and making us the 51st state.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Waltz added that many Canadians \u201cdo not like the last 10 years of liberal, progressive governance in Trudeau.\u201d",
      "\u201cReally, what you\u2019re seeing is a reassertion of American leadership in the Western Hemisphere, from the Arctic all the way down to the Panama Canal,\u201d Waltz said in an interview with \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker, adding: \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about, from Greenland, to Arctic security to the Panama Canal coming back under the United States. America has avoided our own hemisphere \u2014 where we have the energy, the food and the critical minerals \u2014 for way too long, and you\u2019re seeing a reassertion of President Trump\u2019s leadership.\u201d",
      "In the weeks before he was inaugurated to this second term, Trump spoke about his plans to annex Greenland and regain control of the Panama Canal, something Secretary of State Marco Rubio also spoke about when visiting Panama last week.",

      "\u201cIf there is any agency what I have a ton of experience with, in the Department of Defense with an $800 billion-plus budget, it\u2019s, it\u2019s DOD. everything there seems to cost too much, take too long and deliver too little to the soldiers,\u201d Waltz told Welker.",
      "His comment on the DOD came as Trump told Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier in a pretaped interview set to air Sunday before the Super Bowl that he plans to direct Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency office, to start identifying wasteful spending at the departments of Education and Defense.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to tell him very soon, like maybe in 24 hours, to go check the Department of Education. He\u2019s going to find the same thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to go to the military. Let\u2019s check the military. We\u2019re going to find billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse. And, you know, the people elected me on that.\u201d",
      "Asked whether Musk is the right person to identify funding cuts in the Defense Department, Waltz did not directly answer the question, simply saying, \u201cAll of the appropriate firewalls will be in place,\u201d and lauding Musk\u2019s company Space X.",
      "In the Fox News 'Special Report' interview, Baier asked Trump a similar question about whether he can trust Musk.",
      "\u201cTrust Elon? Oh, he\u2019s not gaining anything. In fact, I wonder how he can devote the time to it. He\u2019s so into it,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In the last two weeks, Musk and DOGE have attempted to slash jobs and funding at the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, something Waltz said was justified on Sunday.",
      "\u201c[USAID is] doing all kinds of other things that, frankly, aren\u2019t in line with strategic interests or the president\u2019s vision,\u201d Waltz said, adding that \u201call too often, only cents on the dollar actually makes it to people in need. Between the big contractors, the subcontractors, the local contractors, the dollars aren\u2019t being used wisely.\u201d",
      "He also denied that the U.S. pulling back on humanitarian aid abroad would cede control to China and Russia on the world stage.",

    "summary": "Major apparel brands have cut corners in recent years to limit price hikes on shoppers, embracing lower-quality fabric and finishes to protect their margins.",
    "story": [
      "You\u2019re not imagining it: Well-made clothing is harder to come by. The U.S. fashion industry is having a hard time maintaining quality standards amid stiff competition from overseas rivals and supply-chain shakeups.",
      "Twenty-seven percent of textile and apparel professionals reported that ensuring consistent quality was \u201cdifficult\u201d or \u201cvery difficult\u201d over the past year, up from 23% in 2024, according to a recent survey the product auditing firm QIMA provided to NBC News.",
      "\u201cThere has been a significant reduction in the quality of the fabric for a number of the major brands and retailers,\u201d said Margaret Bishop, a textile development and marketing professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. She said the decline intensified during the recovery from the pandemic, when apparel makers scrambled to untangle disrupted supply chains and contended with weak sales during global lockdowns.",
      "The corner-cutting is partly a tradeoff on price \u2014 a bet that the fashion industry has placed on inflation-weary shoppers\u2019 willingness to accept lower-quality garments that don\u2019t break the bank. Since 2019, consumer prices overall have risen 26%, food is up 30% and cars are up 25%, but apparel prices have inched just 6% higher.",
      "There has been a significant reduction in the quality of the fabric for a number of the major brands and retailers.",
      "Margaret Bishop, Fashion Institute of Technology",
      "Clothing retailers \u201cknow if they raise the price, they lose consumers,\u201d said Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.",
      "While a basic wardrobe of clothing and shoes is essential, households typically approach such purchases as discretionary \u2014 nice-to-haves, at least relative to keeping their cars filled with gas and their fridges stocked with milk and eggs. And over the past year, consumers have repeatedly proved to be laser-focused on value, chasing deals and discounts wherever they can find them.",
      "When it comes to garments and footwear, Americans often find the best prices among sellers overseas, including the China-linked e-commerce giants Shein and Temu. The ultracheap foreign retailers have given domestic rivals such a run for their money that they drew a crackdown from the Biden administration, and the Trump administration\u2019s new China tariffs could crimp them further.",
      "China is already the largest exporter of apparel to the United States, and QIMA\u2019s factory inspections found the failure rate, or share of textile and apparel products with too many defects for market, rose to 13.7% last year from 12.7% in 2023. As many apparel brands move more production out of China to reduce their labor costs and exposure to tariffs, they\u2019re gravitating toward countries with even higher failure rates: India\u2019s is 21.2%, Cambodia\u2019s is 16.6%, and Indonesia\u2019s is 14.2%.",
      "\u201cSomeone who\u2019s running this factory maybe doesn\u2019t have three decades of experience\u201d in many of the emerging garment production markets, said Joseph Ng, CEO of Shift Fashion Group, a consultancy that works with manufacturers. \u201cIt takes a long time to get a large enough workforce to the point where they know what to do exactly.\u201d Those issues are compounded when workers are pushed to generate quantity over quality, he added.",
      "The silver lining is that overall global quality levels have remained relatively flat in recent years, QIMA said, and failure rates in several key manufacturing countries improved noticeably last year.",
      "Nevertheless, the environment spurred \u201ca race to the bottom,\u201d Bishop said, at a time when labor and raw materials costs were rising rapidly.",
      "Demand for both domestic and foreign fast-fashion brands' low-cost apparel has surged. From 2020 to 2024, the top three global fast-fashion retailers \u2014 Shein (based in China), Zara (Spain) and H&M (Sweden) \u2014 nearly tripled their U.S. market share, according to data from Euromonitor. Many other domestic fashion brands have struggled to compete, resorting to promotions to prop up sales and cost-cutting to offset the impact on their profit margins.",
      "Fabric accounts for 60% of a garment\u2019s total production cost, Lu estimated, with labor typically clocking in around 30% and trim \u2014 zippers, buttons or decorative details \u2014 making up the rest. So when retailers look to save money, fabric is one of the first components to get downgraded.",
      "Quality can vary widely even within a single brand\u2019s clothing line, depending on where each of its items is made, Ng said. Large retailers \u201cuse buying houses that will actually produce in different regions, producing different products,\u201d he said. That\u2019s one reason a brand might simultaneously produce high-quality, well-fitting T-shirts and shoddy jeans with haphazard stitching.",
      "The biggest misconception when it comes to fashion is that luxury goods and high-end goods mean quality.",
      "Joseph Ng, CEO of Shift Fashion Group",
      "Julia Hughes, president of the U.S. Fashion Industry Association, acknowledged anecdotal reports of quality concerns in a statement but said that \u201cfor our members \u2014 well-known brands and retailers \u2014 they maintain the same or better quality requirements today.\u201d",
      "For shoppers looking for the best bang for their buck, it can make for a frustrating experience. To identify well-made clothing, Bishop recommends taking the time to examine each garment closely in person. Stitching and fabric are two key indicators of overall quality, she said, adding that heavier fabrics tend to be more durable than lightweight ones.",
      "Bishop also suggests holding garments up to the light to check for small holes or uneven yarn tension. Stitches should be tight, with ideally eight stitches per inch. Avoid garments with loosely sewn buttons and fabrics that lose their shape after they\u2019re stretched, she advised.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a myth that if something\u2019s made from synthetic, it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s cheap,\u201d Bishop said. Nylon is very durable, for example, and polyester is great at wicking sweat.",
      "Ng said: \u201cIt\u2019s really about the right application. When it comes to athletic wear, you don\u2019t want cotton leggings.\u201d",
      "He also cautioned that steep prices don\u2019t necessarily signify better craftsmanship.",
      "\u201cThe biggest misconception when it comes to fashion is that luxury goods and high-end goods mean quality,\u201d Ng said. He added that \u201cthere is a movement starting to happen where consumers want higher-quality clothing.\u201d",
      "Consumers are increasingly valuing repairability, durability and quality, Euromonitor\u2019s market research has found, a trend that coincides with growing interest in secondhand clothing.",
      "The more shoppers are turned off by poorly made, low-cost garments, the more brands have an opportunity to differentiate themselves on \u201cquality and service,\u201d said Marguerite LeRolland, an apparel and footwear industry manager at Euromonitor. That, in turn, can help \u201cjustify higher prices and fewer promotions,\u201d she said."

      "For a vivid trip to the LGBTQ past, forget quantum physics or flux capacitors \u2014 a growing Facebook group, Gay New York 1970s and 80s, serves as a virtual online time machine, guiding its tens of thousands of followers back to an era many of them never knew while building a vibrant online community for the future.",
      "Its popular posts, which routinely get thousands of likes, range from you-are-there recollections of legendary clubs like Studio 54 and The Saint to remembrances of first apartments, first loves and first losses in the AIDS epidemic. This wide array of gay New York stories preserve the past while also make it come alive with Fire Island home videos, vintage Pride photos, DJ playlists and even gay bar matchbook collections. But its 44,000-plus members don\u2019t just reminisce about the old days; they converse with each other about the fun, formative decade after Stonewall as well as the challenges faced in the \u201880s during the AIDS crisis.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just blown away,\u201d said Michael Hawke, 68, surprised by the popularity of the page that he created \u2014 not to mention the passion and participation of its members. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much this group means to all these people.\u201d",
      "Born and raised in Richmond, Virginia, Hawke moved to New York City in 1976, when he was just 21 years old, to pursue work as a model and actor. He\u2019s shared many of his own tales of the city with the group, like a Christopher Street encounter with Marsha P. Johnson, his stint as a stripper at The Show Palace Theater, and wild stories about the city\u2019s burgeoning nightlife scene. But he also posts painful memories of heartbreak, addiction and all the loss he experienced, especially during the \u201880s.",
      "\u201cNew York was beloved to me \u2014 it was my Oz,\u201d said Hawke about how much his 17 years in New York still means to him. \u201cThat\u2019s where I learned to grow up.\u201d",
      "The roots of his Facebook group go back to 2020, when Hawke was stuck in lockdown at his home in Richmond. He was sorting through old boxes in his basement filled with journals, black-and-white photos and memorabilia of his time in New York, including an invite to the opening of Studio 54. And that\u2019s when all the memories flooded back.",
      "\u201cI was looking at these pieces of paper and modeling pictures when I\u2019m 22 on the streets of the city,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd it just inspired me to want to start writing about it.\u201d",
      "Initially his goal was a memoir, until friends encouraged him to share his work online. So he created a private Facebook group called \u201cMichael\u2019s Story,\u201d posting twice a week about his life in NYC\u2019s nascent gay heyday. He said his experience sharing these stories was life-changing.",
      "\u201cWriting about that era helped me process a lot of the death and people I\u2019d lost,\u201d\u00a0 Hawke said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Let me see if this can help somebody else.\u2019\u201d",
      "So in June 2023, he decided to create a new page with a broader mission, allowing members to post their own stories of LGBTQ life in New York City during the 1970s and \u201880s. At first, the page had a modest following of a few hundred members. But it provided a safe space for Hawke and his cohorts to share photos and memories of the magical \u201870s while also helping those who survived the \u201880s to reconnect with each other.",
      "Then, in April of last year, the group exploded as thousands of new followers found it after articles on popular LGBTQ sites like Boy Culture and Kenneth in the 212. While the rule of social media is often \u201cdon\u2019t read the comments,\u201d Hawke said he was surprised to see they were positive and supportive. He also noticed many posts were sparking new conversations and creating connections that brought a real sense of community to this online space \u2014 something rare in these polarized times.",
      "As the group grew exponentially, it began to draw lots of younger followers too, many of whom did not live in New York during the \u201870s and \u201880s \u2014 in fact, some weren\u2019t even born yet. Despite that, they were welcomed warmly into the community, their curiosity sparking new stories as they engaged with other members across the generation gap.",
      "Paul Boudreaux, 38, who lives in Brooklyn and is fascinated by New York\u2019s LGBTQ past, started following the group on a friend\u2019s suggestion. When he shared a photo of his Eartha Kitt concert poster from the \u201880s, he got more than he expected.",
      "\u201cAll these people started commenting, saying they were there and she did these songs and what the mood was like,\u201d he said, adding that the responses made him feel like he was there. \u201cPeople really loved sharing their memories about these things they were there for \u2014 they were just so nice and helpful.\u201d",
      "Some of the most popular and powerful posts have been from members seeking information about family members lost to AIDS. Noel Arce, 37, was adopted by a gay NYC couple in the 1980s who both died of AIDS when he was 7. He posted a family photo last summer and the response was overwhelming: over 1,000 likes and more than 100 comments. He even connected with a man who worked with one of his dads and sent him a photo of a 3-year-old Arce and his father. But even more meaningful were all the supportive comments from the group.",
      "\u201cThey were saying, you know, \u2018Thank you for sharing. That\u2019s very brave of you,\u2019\u201d said Arce, who believes his post served a larger purpose too. \u201cI think the more I share it, it just keeps my dads\u2019 story alive. I think it informs people about the realities of what was happening [with AIDS] back then.\u201d",
      "Another member, Ann Humbach, 64, posted a picture of her biological dad, whom she never knew and died of AIDS in 1984. She was hoping to find anyone acquainted with him to learn more details about his life in the city. Though she didn\u2019t discover any new info, she felt she gained something even greater from all the supportive interactions with other members.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like getting hugs from all of these wonderful strangers who genuinely care. They\u2019re just so kind,\u201d she said, adding that she now tries to give those virtual hugs back. \u201cI\u2019ll post either comments or hugs to people I don\u2019t know.

      "As for Hawke, the site has become not only a place of healing, connection and community, but also an unexpected vocation. He spends multiple hours a day managing and editing all the posts to make sure members stay on point and conversations stay friendly. He\u2019s also working on proposals for a book and a documentary about the group\u2019s impact.",
      "He chalks up Gay New York 1970s and \u201880s\u2019 success to the principles he learned in Alcoholic Anonymous, since getting sober in 1988; mainly, that the group does not discuss outside issues (like current politics) and that it\u2019s guided by a sense of service and giving back to the community. But what surprised him most about the group is how much young people have embraced it. Not only are they followers but actively engaging with other members and learning from them. He thinks that\u2019s because Gen Z yearns for a simpler past.",
      "\u201cEverybody now has to relate through technology,\u201d said Hawke, noting how young people are consumed by their phones. \u201cBut this was a time when you really had to connect to people. You had to get dressed up to look pretty and go to a bar to meet someone. \u201d",
      "When Hawke was a young man, he thought he\u2019d be remembered for his acting work, he said. But lately he\u2019s changed his mind about what he hopes his life\u2019s work will be. Now it\u2019s simply his life \u2014 telling his tales of this remarkable time and inspiring others from his generation to share theirs so that no one forgets this era of LGBTQ history.",
      "\u201cThis is what I would like to be remembered for,\u201d he said referring to his group. \u201cIt\u2019s pulled people together and brought an element of something unexpected to all these people\u2019s lives.\u201d"

    "summary": "Kendrick Lamar's halftime show producer promises a performance 'like none other in Super Bowl halftime history.'",
    "story": [
      "After the biggest year of his professional career \u2014 which resulted in five Grammy Awards for his iconic Drake diss \u201cNot Like Us\u201d \u2014 rapper Kendrick Lamar will take the biggest stage in America when he performs at the Super Bowl on Sunday.",
      "Lamar\u2019s performance, which will also include singer SZA, is highly anticipated after he dominated both culture and music charts for much of 2024. And the people who helped put him onstage aren\u2019t shying away from the hype.",
      "\u201cEveryone will agree this is a halftime show like none other in Super Bowl halftime history,\u201d Jesse Collins, the executive producer of the show, told NBC News. \u201cThe creative concept is really something brilliant, spectacular and special. In all of our years of doing this \u2014 and I think every show that we\u2019ve done has been amazing \u2014 but I have never seen an artist take this creative approach to it.\u201d",
      "Roc Nation, the entertainment company and NFL partner that produces the halftime show, first tabbed Lamar to headline the Super Bowl last summer. He was already a critically acclaimed rapper, and his stardom reached another level after the May 4 release of \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d the knockout blow in his feud with Drake, the Canadian rapper.",
      "The song broke multiple streaming records and earned Lamar five Grammy awards, making it the most decorated rap song in the award show's history.",
      "Not long after the song was released, Lamar got a phone call from Roc Nation founder Jay-Z asking him whether he would perform at the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the stars aligning,\u201d Roc Nation CEO Desiree Perez told NBC News. \u201cWe would hope that every single year someone accomplishes what Kendrick has accomplished this particular year. You can\u2019t even really plan for something to align so perfectly.\u201d",
      "Lamar\u2019s halftime performance will also be the first since the NFL and Roc Nation extended their partnership \u2014 which encompasses both live music and social justice efforts \u2014 in October. Roc Nation\u2019s halftime shows have been well-received, with the 2022 show featuring Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Mary J. Blige becoming the first Super Bowl halftime to win an Emmy.",
      "Perez said the NFL has been very trusting as a partner, never once questioning a decision about the artist selection.",
      "\u201cWhat we bring to the table is not just booking the show; it\u2019s also understanding the environment that we\u2019re going into and understanding what\u2019s going on now,\u201d Perez says. \u201cUnderstanding the pulse of culture at the moment when the show is going to happen and doing that with precision is what I think we\u2019ve been able to master.\u201d",
      "Planning for a Super Bowl halftime typically begins immediately after the previous one, which means Roc Nation has been in meetings for Sunday\u2019s show since last February. During the week of the game, preparation will reach a fever pitch.",
      "Lamar will have at least three days on the field to rehearse before Sunday, and on those days the performers will run through the entire set multiple times. The halftime show is unique in terms of timing and staging \u2014 Lamar has exactly eight minutes to get on the field and six minutes to get off, without damaging the surface where the game is supposed to take place. (Simply getting the stage on and off the field takes more than 100 people, Collins said.)",
      "As for what to expect during the show itself, everyone is predictably tight-lipped. Perez said that whether or not other artists will be involved is entirely up to Lamar, though she said there will be \u201ca few surprises that we haven\u2019t seen in the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cKendrick is one of the most creative, incredible artists of our lifetime, and ... he is not going to disappoint,\u201d she said when she was asked directly what fans should be excited for.",
      "Collins said: \u201cRoc Nation, Jay, Kendrick and his whole team, we\u2019ve all really busted our ass to figure out something different. And I think people are going to be blown away.\u201d"

      "According to the NTSB, the air traffic control display showed that the helicopter appeared to be flying at 300 feet at the time of the collision. That's 100 feet above the 200 foot ceiling generally required under federal aviation rules for helicopters.",

    "story": [
      "For a vivid trip to the LGBTQ past, forget quantum physics or flux capacitors \u2014 a growing Facebook group, Gay New York 1970s and 80s, serves as a virtual online time machine, guiding its tens of thousands of followers back to an era many of them never knew while building a vibrant online community for the future.",
      "Its popular posts, which routinely get thousands of likes, range from you-are-there recollections of legendary clubs like Studio 54 and The Saint to remembrances of first apartments, first loves and first losses in the AIDS epidemic. This wide array of gay New York stories preserve the past while also make it come alive with Fire Island home videos, vintage Pride photos, DJ playlists and even gay bar matchbook collections. But its 44,000-plus members don\u2019t just reminisce about the old days; they converse with each other about the fun, formative decade after Stonewall as well as the challenges faced in the \u201880s during the AIDS crisis.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just blown away,\u201d said Michael Hawke, 68, surprised by the popularity of the page that he created \u2014 not to mention the passion and participation of its members. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much this group means to all these people.\u201d",
      "Born and raised in Richmond, Virginia, Hawke moved to New York City in 1976, when he was just 21 years old, to pursue work as a model and actor. He\u2019s shared many of his own tales of the city with the group, like a Christopher Street encounter with Marsha P. Johnson, his stint as a stripper at The Show Palace Theater, and wild stories about the city\u2019s burgeoning nightlife scene. But he also posts painful memories of heartbreak, addiction and all the loss he experienced, especially during the \u201880s.",
      "\u201cNew York was beloved to me \u2014 it was my Oz,\u201d said Hawke about how much his 17 years in New York still means to him. \u201cThat\u2019s where I learned to grow up.\u201d",
      "The roots of his Facebook group go back to 2020, when Hawke was stuck in lockdown at his home in Richmond. He was sorting through old boxes in his basement filled with journals, black-and-white photos and memorabilia of his time in New York, including an invite to the opening of Studio 54. And that\u2019s when all the memories flooded back.",
      "\u201cI was looking at these pieces of paper and modeling pictures when I\u2019m 22 on the streets of the city,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd it just inspired me to want to start writing about it.\u201d",
      "Initially his goal was a memoir, until friends encouraged him to share his work online. So he created a private Facebook group called \u201cMichael\u2019s Story,\u201d posting twice a week about his life in NYC\u2019s nascent gay heyday. He said his experience sharing these stories was life-changing.",
      "\u201cWriting about that era helped me process a lot of the death and people I\u2019d lost,\u201d\u00a0 Hawke said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Let me see if this can help somebody else.\u2019\u201d",
      "So in June 2023, he decided to create a new page with a broader mission, allowing members to post their own stories of LGBTQ life in New York City during the 1970s and \u201880s. At first, the page had a modest following of a few hundred members. But it provided a safe space for Hawke and his cohorts to share photos and memories of the magical \u201870s while also helping those who survived the \u201880s to reconnect with each other.",
      "Then, in April of last year, the group exploded as thousands of new followers found it after articles on popular LGBTQ sites like Boy Culture and Kenneth in the 212. While the rule of social media is often \u201cdon\u2019t read the comments,\u201d Hawke said he was surprised to see they were positive and supportive. He also noticed many posts were sparking new conversations and creating connections that brought a real sense of community to this online space \u2014 something rare in these polarized times.",
      "As the group grew exponentially, it began to draw lots of younger followers too, many of whom did not live in New York during the \u201870s and \u201880s \u2014 in fact, some weren\u2019t even born yet. Despite that, they were welcomed warmly into the community, their curiosity sparking new stories as they engaged with other members across the generation gap.",
      "Paul Boudreaux, 38, who lives in Brooklyn and is fascinated by New York\u2019s LGBTQ past, started following the group on a friend\u2019s suggestion. When he shared a photo of his Eartha Kitt concert poster from the \u201880s, he got more than he expected.",
      "\u201cAll these people started commenting, saying they were there and she did these songs and what the mood was like,\u201d he said, adding that the responses made him feel like he was there. \u201cPeople really loved sharing their memories about these things they were there for \u2014 they were just so nice and helpful.\u201d",
      "Some of the most popular and powerful posts have been from members seeking information about family members lost to AIDS. Noel Arce, 37, was adopted by a gay NYC couple in the 1980s who both died of AIDS when he was 7. He posted a family photo last summer and the response was overwhelming: over 1,000 likes and more than 100 comments. He even connected with a man who worked with one of his dads and sent him a photo of a 3-year-old Arce and his father. But even more meaningful were all the supportive comments from the group.",
      "\u201cThey were saying, you know, \u2018Thank you for sharing. That\u2019s very brave of you,\u2019\u201d said Arce, who believes his post served a larger purpose too. \u201cI think the more I share it, it just keeps my dads\u2019 story alive. I think it informs people about the realities of what was happening [with AIDS] back then.\u201d",
      "Another member, Ann Humbach, 64, posted a picture of her biological dad, whom she never knew and died of AIDS in 1984. She was hoping to find anyone acquainted with him to learn more details about his life in the city. Though she didn\u2019t discover any new info, she felt she gained something even greater from all the supportive interactions with other members.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like getting hugs from all of these wonderful strangers who genuinely care. They\u2019re just so kind,\u201d she said, adding that she now tries to give those virtual hugs back. \u201cI\u2019ll post either comments or hugs to people I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a connection you don\u2019t find in too many places.\u201d",
      "As for Hawke, the site has become not only a place of healing, connection and community, but also an unexpected vocation. He spends multiple hours a day managing and editing all the posts to make sure members stay on point and conversations stay friendly. He\u2019s also working on proposals for a book and a documentary about the group\u2019s impact.",
      "He chalks up Gay New York 1970s and \u201880s\u2019 success to the principles he learned in Alcoholic Anonymous, since getting sober in 1988; mainly, that the group does not discuss outside issues (like current politics) and that it\u2019s guided by a sense of service and giving back to the community. But what surprised him most about the group is how much young people have embraced it. Not only are they followers but actively engaging with other members and learning from them. He thinks that\u2019s because Gen Z yearns for a simpler past.",
      "\u201cEverybody now has to relate through technology,\u201d said Hawke, noting how young people are consumed by their phones. \u201cBut this was a time when you really had to connect to people. You had to get dressed up to look pretty and go to a bar to meet someone. \u201d",
      "When Hawke was a young man, he thought he\u2019d be remembered for his acting work, he said. But lately he\u2019s changed his mind about what he hopes his life\u2019s work will be. Now it\u2019s simply his life \u2014 telling his tales of this remarkable time and inspiring others from his generation to share theirs so that no one forgets this era of LGBTQ history.",
      "\u201cThis is what I would like to be remembered for,\u201d he said referring to his group. \u201cIt\u2019s pulled people together and brought an element of something unexpected to all these people\u2019s lives.\u201d"

      "\u201cI finished it on the night of Jan. 6, and so it\u2019s important for me to just process my own emotions and thoughts as an American watching that violence against our democracy,\u201d Gorman said.",
      "\u201cI had no idea it was going to reverberate and resonate in the way it did. \u2026 It was something historic and personal and meaningful and powerful, and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world,\u201d she said.",
      "After the inauguration, Gorman published another book and co-hosted the Met Gala later that year. Now, she\u2019s focused on building a better world for the next generation with a children\u2019s book \u201cthat underscores the importance of community and allyship,\u201d Gorman said.",
      "Gorman\u2019s inaugural poem was restricted in a Florida school in 2023 after a parent filed a complaint against it. She said it was \u201ca bit like a gut punch\u201d when she found out her work would be restricted, but she fears for children\u2019s right to read and learn in the context of the thousands of book bans in schools and libraries in recent years.",
      "\u201cThese books that are being banned predominantly feature authors and characters of color, authors and characters of the LGBTQ community, and so we\u2019re seeing entire identities erased from bookshelves,\u201d Gorman said. \u201cAnd when a child can\u2019t see themselves represented in a story, they can\u2019t dream of their own life, to actualize their own hopes.\u201d",
      "Gorman urged the importance of representation, adding that she felt immense pressure as a then 22-year-old poet in the national spotlight.",
      "\u201cI felt a lot of weight, because I knew if I failed or didn\u2019t do an excellent job, it would\u201d become an excuse to exclude young people from lofty ceremonies, she said. \u201cAnd so you feel this aspiration to do well for yourself, but to be extraordinary for people who follow.\u201d",
      "Gorman, an activist herself, said she draws inspiration from orators and activists like Maya Angelou \u2014 also an inaugural poet in 1993 for President Bill Clinton \u2014 and Martin Luther King Jr. She said she may run for president when she\u2019s of age in 2036.",
      "\u201cI hope my mark,\u201d she said, \u201cis being a wordsmith and a change maker who speaks in a language that allows our country to return to love, legacy and connection.\u201d"

      "Why is Drake suing his record label, Universal Music Group?",
      "Drake filed a federal lawsuit against his record label, UMG, on Jan. 15 alleging that the company helped to spread a \u201cfalse and malicious\u201d narrative about him by promoting and releasing his rap rival Kendrick Lamar\u2019s diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot Like Us,\u201d the lawsuit states, \u201cfalsely accuses Drake of being a pedophile and calls for violent retribution against him.\u201d",
      "Drake\u2019s lawsuit notes that the cover image for \u201cNot Like Us\u201d features an aerial photo of Drake\u2019s home in Toronto that\u2019s covered with red markers like those that are used \u201cto identify child sex offenders and their residences on public registries,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.",
      "The suit also details several violent break-in attempts at Drake\u2019s Toronto home that he and his legal team believe were \u201cproximately caused by\u201d the lyrics of \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe lyrics repeatedly accuse Drake of engaging in criminal acts, including by calling him a \u2018certified pedophile[]\u2019 and a \u2018predator\u2019 who needs to be \u2018placed on neighborhood watch,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit states.",
      "Drake and his team allege that UMG chose \u201ccorporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists,\u201d by releasing the single even though they \u201cknew that the salacious allegations against Drake were false.\u201d",
      "Drake\u2019s legal team previously filed a petition in November, which was later withdrawn on Jan. 14, accusing UMG of using payola and bots to boost the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on Spotify. The new lawsuit, however, does include similar messaging and repeats some of the same claims.",
      "UMG responded to Drake\u2019s legal petition in November, saying they use \u201cethical practices\u201d for their campaigns.",
      "\u201cWe employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Spotify declined to comment to NBC News at the time of Drake\u2019s complaint. The music streaming service, however, does note on their website that artificial streaming is a major issue and they strictly prohibit \u201cusing any third party service that promises streams or playlist placement in exchange for money.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe have invested massively in his music and our employees around the world have worked tirelessly for many years to help him achieve historic commercial and personal financial success,\u201d the label said.",
      "\u201cThroughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth \u2018rap battles\u2019 to express his feelings about other artists. He now seeks to weaponize the legal process to silence an artist\u2019s creative expression and to seek damages from UMG for distributing that artist\u2019s music.\u201d",

      "However, things changed after Lamar took shots at Drake and other rappers during his guest verses on Big Sean\u2019s song \u201cControl\u201d in August 2013. He appeared to ridicule Drake again in his lyrics during a performance at the BET Hip-Hop Awards in October 2013.",

      "The diss tracks continued at a breakneck pace until it eventually died down in the summer of 2024.",
      "How successful has \u2018Not Like Us\u2019 been?",
      "Both Drake and Lamar have benefited from their renewed beef over the past year. Both artists scored multiple hit songs and received several competing nominations at the 2024 BET Awards.",

      "In a viral video posted on X July 10, HipHopDX\u2019s Jeremy Hecht shared what appeared to be a glitch concerning Apple\u2019s Siri. He noted that if a fan used iPhone\u2019s Siri app to ask the device to play Drake\u2019s \u201cCertified Lover Boy,\u201d Spotify would instead put on Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "As Hecht explained, Siri appears to be doing this because the app, which uses lyrics, songs and album titles to identify music, doesn\u2019t always go by a song\u2019s specific title.",
      "For those scratching their heads as to how Siri could possibly mix up the two distinctive tracks, Hecht reminded fans that in Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us\u201d song he references Drake\u2019s record by rapping, \u201cCertified Lover Boy? Certified pedophile.\u201d This mention is what appears to create the confusion for Siri.",
      "However, it\u2019s worth noting that the mixup doesn\u2019t always happen and that for some users, after Lamar\u2019s song is played instead of Drake\u2019s, Spotify seemingly corrects itself when asked by Siri for the second time.",

      "While it's likely the internet might break if he brings Swift out during his halftime performance, there's one other star that could similarly shatter the minds of music fans everywhere if Lamar brings her out: Beyonc\u00e9. If you recall, the two collaborated on the track \u201cFreedom\u201d and \u201cAMERICA HAS A PROBLEM\u201d remix. Lamar previously joined Queen Bey on her Renaissance World Tour in September 2023.",

      "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s love story has been set in stadiums across the world, on the biggest stages in music and sports. Their romance fittingly started with a friendship bracelet \u2014 the symbol of the singer\u2019s record-breaking \u201cEras Tour\u201d \u2014 and now, a year and a half later, their relationship is one for the ages.",
      "The timeline began when Kelce, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, saw Swift perform at his home stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, in July 2023. After the concert, Kelce famously expressed his interest in Swift during an episode of \u201cNew Heights,\u201d the podcast he hosts with his brother, former NFL star Jason Kelce. The tight end revealed that he had tried \u2014 and failed\u00a0\u2014 to give Swift a bracelet with his phone number on it.",
      "What fans didn\u2019t know at the time was that Swift was paying attention, and the pair got to know each other behind the scenes. Rumors went into overdrive in September 2023 when Swift attended the first of many Chiefs games to cheer on Travis Kelce and his team.",

      "The tight end told his brother on the July 26, 2023, episode \u201cNew Heights\u201d that he created a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it and intended to give it to Swift at the concert.",
      "\u201cI was disappointed that she doesn\u2019t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings. So I was a little butt-hurt I didn\u2019t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,\u201d he said.",

These are the issues that matter,\" Jack Schlossberg said, adding, \"And if my cousin, Bobby Kennedy Jr., cared about any of them, he would support Joe Biden too.\"",
      "He continued, \u201cInstead, he\u2019s trading in on Camelot, celebrity conspiracy theories and conflict for personal gain and fame. I\u2019ve listened to him. I know him. I have no idea why anyone thinks he should be president. What I do know is his candidacy is an embarrassment. Let\u2019s not be distracted again by somebody\u2019s vanity project.

      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to ask people to think about something serious, you need to make it entertaining or fun,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what all the great leaders do. You can\u2019t just hammer people with how bad stuff is. You\u2019ve got to bring some positivity and good energy to the things you think are important.\u201d",

      "Some lines from Natalie Dal-Bello, played by Essie Davis, appear to be inspired by real quotes from Dal-Bello, either from interviews Dal-Bello gave to Donelly and Toscano for \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d or from her 2015 interview with The Weekly.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t begin to tell you how embarrassed we are by what that girl has done. And for all the poor people who she has deceived, for the small part that we have played in her life, I am deeply and profoundly sorry,\u201d the Natalie character says in the show, which closely echoes a statement the real Dal-Bello made to The Weekly.",
      "The character of publisher Julie Gibbs, played by Catherine McClements, appears to be directly inspired by the\u00a0real-life Julie Gibbs, the\u00a0former director of Lantern, an imprint of the Penguin publishing house\u00a0focused on cookbooks.",
      "The real Gibbs worked with\u00a0Gibson on her Whole Pantry cookbook. She left\u00a0Penguin in 2015 following the unraveling of Gibson\u2019s cancer story, according to Donelly and Toscano. She declined to be interviewed for \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World",
      "Which \u2018Apple Cider Vinegar\u2019 characters are fictional?",
      "Some characters in \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d are fictional, though they appear to be at least partly inspired by people who encountered Belle Gibson.",
      "The character of Milla Blake, a wellness influencer who claims she cured herself of cancer using natural methods, is an \u201camalgamation of wellness influences at the time,\u201d Alycia Debnam-Carey, who played Milla in the series, told TODAY.com.",
      "Debnam-Carey says \u201cparallels can be made\u201d between Milla\u2019s character and Jess Ainscough, an Australian influencer known to her supporters as \u201cThe Wellness Warrior.\u201d",
      "Similar to what is shown in Milla\u2019s storyline, Ainscough found lumps on her arm in her early 20s and was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. Doctors advised her to amputate her left arm at her shoulder, but she declined this surgery and tried chemotherapy instead. This worked temporarily, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "When the cancer recurred a year later, Ainscough decided not to amputate, and instead searched for alternative healing methods. She ended up devoting herself to Gerson therapy, a controversial regimen developed in the 1920s that claims to \u201cdetoxify\u201d the body through methods including a clean diet, juicing and frequent coffee enemas.",
      "According to multiple studies from The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, Gerson therapy has \u201cdemonstrated no benefit\u201d and \u201ccannot be recommended\u201d to people with cancer, and in some cases may have adverse effects.",
      "Ainscough gained a large following as she posted about her wellness journey on social media, and in 2013 she released a bestselling book, \u201cMake Peace With Your Plate.\u201d",
      "Seven years after she was first diagnosed with cancer, Ainscough died at 29 in 2015.",
      "Milla\u2019s story in \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d has close parallels with Ainscough\u2019s life, and the controversial Hirsch Institute Milla attends in Mexico seems to be a fictionalized version of the Gerson Institute.",
      "However, their stories diverge in places. In the show, Milla is shown as turning away from conventional medical treatments from the beginning. Ainscough\u2019s family, however, has said she was willing to try chemotherapy at first.",
      "\u201cIt has \u2026 been said that Jess shunned conventional treatment and doctors, this \u2026 is incorrect,\u201d her family said in a tribute to Ainscough shared by Australia\u2019s The Sunshine Coast Daily.",
      "Still, while there are several similarities between Ainscough and Milla, Debnam-Carey says Milla\u2019s character was invented as someone who could go \u201ctoe-to-toe with Belle.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat parallel dynamic of the two of them was such an interesting story,\u201d she said. \u201cBelle is someone who\u2019s lying to the world, but Milla is sort of lying to herself, but also convinced that she\u2019s done this to herself, that she\u2019s caused the cancer that\u2019s in her.\u201d",
      "The character of Lucy (Tilda Cobham-Hervey), a woman with breast cancer who is inspired by Belle\u2019s social media posts, is also fictional.",
      "The show\u2019s creator, Samantha Strauss, describes Lucy as \u201cthe heart of the show,\u201d and says Lucy represents the many people who were influenced by Gibson\u2019s messaging.",
      "\u201cLucy\u2019s us,\u201d Strauss tells TODAY.com. \u201cLucy is the people who could suffer because of people like Belle.\u201d",
      "While Lucy is fictional, her story shares similarities with Kate Thomas, who is featured extensively in \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "Like Lucy, Thomas was diagnosed with breast cancer in her 30s. As she underwent chemotherapy, she came across Gibson on social media and was drawn to her discussion of alternative treatment methods.",
      "\u201cTo see that she had gone through this, but had done it the natural way, was inspiring,\u201d Thomas told Donelly and Toscano for their book. \u201cShe gave hope to people like me that maybe we didn\u2019t have to put ourselves through such intense treatment. Maybe we could survive.\u201d",
      "Thomas\u2019 partner, Nik Donaldson, was skeptical of Gibson\u2019s claims, according to the book, which mirrors the dynamic between Lucy and Justin on the show.",
      "After learning about Gibson\u2019s scam, Thomas said she felt betrayed and furious on behalf of people who had abandoned proven medical treatments based on Gibson\u2019s advice.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t know how she can live with herself,\u201d Thomas told Donelly and Toscano. \u201cPeople would be saying, \u2018You\u2019re such an inspiration, I\u2019ve decided not to do chemo\u2019 \u2026 Belle would have been reading those comments and knowing that people were stopping treatment. That is not OK.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Thomas decided to continue with conventional treatment. In May 2024, an interview with Thomas in Australia\u2019s Geelong Advertiser stated that Thomas was at that time \u201cclear of cancer.\u201d",
      "Actor Aisha Dee describes her character Chanelle as \u201ca voice of reason\u201d who \u201crepresents the audience in a way.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s kind of seeing things in the same way that I think you see it when you\u2019re watching it on your TV at home,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "Gibson did have a friend named Chanelle in real life who was interviewed for \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d but their stories have some differences.",
      "The Chanelle character in the show works with both Milla Blake and Gibson.\u00a0There is no evidence that the real Chanelle did the same.",
      "According to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d the real Chanelle did challenge Gibson about her cancer claims, and recalled a time Gibson faked a seizure at her son\u2019s birthday party, as shown in the series."

      "When Heidi Gardner broke character and busted out laughing in a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch that became an instant classic, it was as much a triumph for the show's makeup department as the writers and cast members.",
      "Guest host Ryan Gosling and \"SNL\" cast member Mikey Day had Gardner laughing uncontrollably when they were clad in wigs and prosthetics to look like animated '90s icons Beavis and Butt-Head in an episode on April 13, 2024. Day's exposed gums as Butt-Head particularly had Gardner losing it.",
      "That was the work of the 20 artists on the show's Emmy-winning makeup team led by Louie Zakarian, who has been building elaborate prosthetics on the show for nearly 30 years.",
      "Zakarian gave NBC's Joe Fryer a look behind the curtain on TODAY in a segment that aired Feb. 7, just over a week ahead of the \"SNL\" 50th anniversary special.",
      "The ace makeup team that creates the bald caps, facial hair and intricate prosthetics often doesn't even start making them until Thursday and sometimes Friday each week.",
      "They also only have a few minutes to either put them on or take them off the cast members once the live episode starts on Saturday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s choreographed mayhem,\" Zakarian told Fryer. \"It\u2019s like a pit crew.\u00a0Everybody knows what they have to do. Everybody knows where they have to be at any given moment, and we can get them in and out of that chair within minutes.\u201d",
      "In one recent episode, cast member Sarah Sherman went from having a prosthetic attached to her nose for a sketch about a dog park to transforming into a 92-year-old woman in a matter of minutes for another sketch.",
      "\"It\u2019s happening to me, and I don\u2019t even know how it\u2019s happening,\" Sherman said on TODAY about the rapid transformations.",
      "A crucial part of the process is making \"lifecasts\" of every host and cast member. It's what allows Zakarian and his staff to pull off transformations like putting dog noses on 10 cast members in 10 minutes for the dog park sketch during a live episode.",
      "The \"lifecasts\" are now done with high-tech scanners that can map a person's face in minutes. A 3D printer is then used to turn the scans into a mold of the person's face.",

      "\"It went crazy,\" Zakarian said.",
      "The department is a favorite of Sherman, who believes their creations help her better get into character. Zakarian worked on the prosthetics during this current \"SNL\" season when Sherman played the vampire Nosferatu in reference to the recent movie of that title.",
      "\"Once I have really long vampire fingers, then and only then can I finally actually figure out what the voice is of the character,\" Sherman said on TODAY.",

      "Dorinda Medley made a costly mistake in Episode 1 when she decided to sacrifice her safety in the mission to help the team complete the task. After her selfless act was unappreciated by the rest of the cast, The \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star bickered with British royal Lord Ivar Mountbatten and a few others, placing a target on her back. The Traitors pounced on the opportunity and decided to make her their first victim, killing her off in Episode 2.",

      "During Episode 2, at the first roundtable of Season 3, Wells Adams had the tables turned on him. He initially planned to call out \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d star Robyn Dixon as a potential Traitor following an awkward interaction between them earlier. But, she proved to be more convincing and reflected the spotlight onto him instead. \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d alum was banished after receiving a majority of the votes. Before he left, he revealed that he was a Faithful.",

Then, she struggled after Wells\u2019 elimination as he was one of her closest friends and allies in the house. In Episode 3, the Traitors decided to murder another housewife to create more confusion in the castle. As \u201cThe Real Housewives of Dubai\u201d star learned her fate, she became emotional and questioned how the Traitors could be so cruel.",
      "Tony Vlachos",
      "Tony Vlachos, a two-time \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner, had his stint on Season 3 cut short after placing his trust in the wrong people. During the third mission, Bob Harper called out Tony for not volunteering to go first and risk his safety. Tony didn\u2019t appreciate being put on blast and voiced his irritations during the car ride home. At the roundtable, Bob Harper learned Tony was upset with him and started to wonder if Tony was a Traitor. Although the \u201cSurvivor\u201d star tried to prove his innocence, a majority of the cast voted him out in Episode 3. Before departing, a hurt Tony confirmed he was a Faithful and labeled fellow \u201cSurvivor\u201d alum Rob Mariano a \u201csellout\u201d for turning on him.",
      "Jeremy Collins",
      "Episode 4 began with the conclusion of a special task for the Traitors. They were required to meet in a secret room in the castle and scribe three names, either Faithfuls or Traitors, onto a hidden parchment, shortlisting them for murder. The Traitors selected \"Survivor\" winner Jeremy Collins, \"Summer House\" star Ciara Miller and retired professional wrestler Nikki Garcia. Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate. Although Jeremy offered to work with the Traitors if he was spared, they chose to murder him since he correctly suspected \"Big Brother\" star Danielle Reyes was a Traitor. In his final confessional, Jeremy became emotional as he spoke about not bringing home the prize pot to his family.",
      "Bob the Drag Queen",
      "Bob the Drag Queen's devilishly cunning run on Season 3 was cut short in Episode 4 when his fellow Traitors, particularly Rob, turned on him. Bob had been vocal throughout the season, trying to cast suspicion onto others and throw his adversaries off his scent. But when he suggested the group question if the three newcomers \u2014 Rob, Wes and Derrick \u2014 were possible Traitors, Rob took it as an opportunity stab the \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" winner in the back. Rob convinced the group to banish Bob, stunning him. After being voted out, Rob stood before the cast and proudly confirmed he had lied and was a Traitor.",
      "Robyn Dixon",
      "After a roaring roundtable that resulted in one of their own being exposed, the remaining Traitors plotted in Episode 5 to murder someone who would draw suspicion away from them. They debated back and forth, with one Traitor failing to be heard. Ultimately, they decided that murdering Robyn Dixon would add to the confusion permeating throughout the castle. When \"The Real Housewives of Potomac\" star learned she had been eliminated, she said, \"I knew it was coming because I am a threat to the Traitors.\" In her parting words, she advised the Traitors to \"work harder\" after losing Bob the Drag Queen.",
      "Nikki Garcia",
      "Nikki Garcia was living on borrowed time in the castle after the Traitors set up her inevitable downfall. After being selected as one of the three contestants to lie in the coffin in Episode 4, the rest of the contestants assumed that at least one cast member chosen was a Traitor. The former WWE star deflected suspicion at first, but in Episode 5, one of her closest allies, Chrishell Stause, started to doubt her. Chrishell voiced her concerns about Nikki during the roundtable, leading most of the group to vote her out. \"The win for me is that I do get to go home to my son. The loss for all of you is that I'm a Faithful,\" Nikki said as she left.",
      "Bob Harper",
      "As Episode 6 began, the trust between the Traitors was at an all time low.  They met in the turret and discussed their \"dysfunctional family\" before listing their targets. They settled on Bob Harper, who was vocal at the most recent roundtable about who the Faithfuls couldn't trust. The three remaining Traitors labeled him as \"the more imminent threat\" and agreed to murder him. When \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer didn't show up for breakfast the next morning, the cast, excluding the Traitors, were stunned. After Bob H. read his letter from the Traitors, he said, \"No f---ing way. I think the Traitors are playing a really ballsy game. They're very invincible right now because they are so hidden. I'm angry. I'm just angry over the train of thought of why I was murdered. I hate the Traitors.\"",
      "Wes Bergmann",
      "At the end of the Episode 6, Wes Bergmann planned to turn on Rob, but the \"Survivor\" winner beat him to it. Throughout the episode, Wes had been suggesting Rob's name to multiple people. When everyone arrived at the roundtable, Rob used Wes' scheming ways against him and pointed out that Wes pushed for Nikki to be banished. To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\"",
      "Derrick Levasseur",
      "Derrick Levasseur took a chance during the roundtable in Episode 6 and voiced his theory about Rob being a traitor. The next episode, his boldness came back to bite him. When the Traitors met in secret at the beginning of Episode 7, they begrudgingly decided the \"Big Brother\" winner needed to go to help rebuild trust between them. As Derrick learned his fate, he was unsurprised. \"I knew that after I called out Rob directly last night, and he chose to instead go at Wes, that he was not going to give me another roundtable, which I guess I have to take as a compliment,\" Derrick said. He proudly added, \"I'm the most dangerous person in here for the Traitors, and they know it.\" He said he would have made the same move and that he was \"honored\" to have been a part of the season.",
      "Rob 'Boston Rob' Mariano",
      "Rob's smooth-talking and cunning ways could no longer save him by Episode 7. Before he departed, Derrick planted seeds to his fellow Faithfuls, cautioning them that Rob was a Traitor. At breakfast, Rob posed the theory that the Traitors had murdered Derrick to make the \"Survivor\" star look guilty. But \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was unconvinced and realized that it was the third time a Faithful was murdered after publicly going against Rob. So, Tom presented that evidence during the roundtable, hoping that others would jump on board. After everyone voted, Rob received a majority of votes \u2014 including two from his fellow Traitors \u2014 and was banished, ending his masterful run this season. \"First of all, I just want to tell all of you that I have really enjoyed meeting you and playing this game with you. I've had a ton of fun,\" he said during his final speech. \"I am, and always have been, from the very beginning, a Traitor.\""

      "\"I don't know how to describe it,\" said Watchara, 33. \"It's like being reborn.\"",
      "Watchara and four other former Thai hostages arrived in Bangkok earlier Sunday, days after being released by Hamas after 15 months of captivity.",
      "The group, which also included Sarusak Rumnao, 32, Sathian Suwannakham, 35, Pongsak Thaenna, 36, and Bannawat Saethao, 27, was released as part of the hostage-prisoners exchange deal Israel struck with Hamas last month.",
      "They were met at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok by family members as well as Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa and the Israeli ambassador to Thailand, Orna Sagiv, before continuing on to their hometowns.",
      "\"We were waiting so long for this day,\" Watchara's mother, Wiwwaeo Sriaoun, told NBC News in an interview Sunday in his home village of Thali in the northeastern province of Udon Thani.",

      "\"I told him that he didn't need to talk about it and when he was ready, he can do so,\" she said. \"Just come back first.\"",
      "According to his mother, Watchara had been an agricultural worker in Israel for more than three years when Hamas carried out its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel. Watchara, who was working at Kibbutz Nir Oz near Israel's southern border with the Gaza Strip, was among 31 Thai nationals taken hostage, the largest group of foreigners to be held captive.",
      "Twenty-three of them were released in November 2023 during an early ceasefire, while two others were confirmed to have been killed in the attack before their bodies were taken to Gaza. A total of 46 Thai nationals have died in the Israel-Hamas war.",

      "With a population of 9 million, Israel is heavily dependent on foreign labor in sectors such as agriculture, construction and caregiving. While the country has been historically reliant on Palestinian labor, Israel began recruiting foreign workers after the Palestinian revolt that ended in 1993.",
      "Thais arrived in large numbers, drawn by higher wages than they could earn back home, and remain the largest group of foreign agricultural laborers in the country.",
      "Nearly 25,000 Thai workers worked in Israel before the Oct. 7 attack, Chandraramya said.",
      "\u201cThey worked tirelessly in the farm, in the kibbutz,\u201d she told reporters last week.",
      "After the attack, many workers fled their jobs in Israel, which began offering higher salaries and launched a recruitment drive in countries including India to secure the critical supply of foreign labor.",
      "Thais have since gone to Israel in bigger numbers than before, and Chandraramya said there were now 38,000 workers in the country.",

      "Following an alert saying its islands were under the threat of a possible tsunami, the Cayman Islands government's hazard management agency said late Saturday that an \"all clear\" had been issued for its land \u2014 Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman.",
      "No tsunami was observed, it said in a statement.",
      "\"This was a large earthquake and [we] are thankful that no major damage has been reported across our Islands,\" Danielle Coleman, director of Hazard Management Cayman Islands, said in a statement.",
      "In the minutes after the quake, the agency said a tsunami was possible, and it urged people along Cayman Islands coastlines to move inland.",
      "The Cayman Islands hazard management agency described tsunamis as deceptively powerful, sometimes measuring only 1.5 feet but moving water in a wave that can be 50-60 miles wide. Such a wave\u2019s crushing flow of water is its most damaging element, the agency said, with a telltale sign of a tsunami in progress being a rapidly receding sea ahead of the sea's rush.",
      "The U.S. Tsunami Warning System said Cuba had been under a similar threat \u2014 a tsunami measuring between around 3 feet and 10 feet high. Overnight, it had no active warnings, advisories, watches or threats for the region that includes Cuba.",

      "\u201cAlthough no major impact event is anticipated, as a safety precaution no one should be in the water until further notice,\" she said.",
      "The USGS initially measured the earthquake at a massive 8.0, but later reassessed its energy and determined it measured 7.6.",
      "Because the temblor was located below an island surrounded by the Caribbean, according to USGS mapping, the agency said \"little or no population\" was exposed to the shaking.",
      "The USGS placed the quake at a strike slip fault near the boundary between the North America and Caribbean tectonic plates.",
      "\"Large earthquakes at this location of the plate boundary are not unexpected,\" the agency said in an analysis published on its website Saturday night.",
      "It said 10 magnitude 6 or greater temblors have happened in the area in the last century. One of the most notable earthquakes in the region took place on Jan. 10, 2018, when a magnitude 7.5 temblor \"caused some damage and a small tsunami,\" the USGS said.",
      "\"Luckily, the remote location of these earthquakes limits the potential for significant damage due to shaking,\" it said."

He also occasionally waged a verbal war on homosexuality, calling gays \u201cidiots\u201d and branding homosexuality a \u201cforeign and corrupt ideology.\u201d",
      "He once banned all foreign television programs, declaring they had corrupted the youth of Namibia.",
      "Nujoma built ties with North Korea, Cuba, Russia and China, some of which had supported Namibia\u2019s liberation movement by providing arms and training.",
      "But he balanced that with outreach to the West, and Nujoma was the first African leader to be hosted at the White House by former U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1993. Clinton called Nujoma \u201cthe George Washington of his country\u201d and \u201ca genuine hero of the world\u2019s movement toward democracy.\u201d",
      "Nujoma also advocated for the advancement of women in a largely patriarchal region, saying \u201cthere is no shortage of competent and experienced African women to lead the way forward.\u201d Namibia elected its first female president last year and President-elect Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah\u2019s term is due to start next month.",
      "Nujoma grew up in a rural, impoverished family, the eldest of 11 children. His early life revolved around looking after his parents\u2019 cattle and the cultivation of land. He attended a mission school before moving to Windhoek and working for South African Railways.",
      "He was arrested following a political protest in 1959 and fled the territory shortly after his release to go into exile in Tanzania. In exile, he helped establish the South West African People\u2019s Organization and was named its president in 1960. SWAPO has been Namibia\u2019s ruling party since 1990, and Nujoma ultimately led it for 47 years until stepping down in 2007.",
      "When South Africa refused to heed a 1966 U.N. resolution ending the mandate it had been given over the German colony of South West Africa after World War I, Nujoma launched SWAPO\u2019s guerrilla campaign.",
      "\u201cWe started the armed struggle with only two sub-machine guns and two pistols,\u201d Nujoma once said. \u201cI got them from Algeria, plus some rounds of ammunition.\u201d",
      "SWAPO never achieved military victory in an independence war that lasted more than 20 years, but Nujoma won wide political support during his exile, leading to the U.N. declaring SWAPO the sole representative of the Namibian people and South Africa ultimately withdrawing from the country.",
      "As he mixed with world leaders, Nujoma was aware of his lack of education. He left school early to work and later attended night school, largely to improve his English. He said he instead dedicated his life to his country\u2019s liberation.",
      "\u201cOthers got their education while I led the struggle,\u201d he said."

      "BEIRUT \u2014 Lebanon\u2019s new prime minister on Saturday formed the country\u2019s first full-fledged government since 2022.",
      "President\u00a0Joseph Aoun\u00a0announced in a statement that he had accepted the resignation of the former caretaker government and signed a decree with new Prime Minister\u00a0Nawaf Salam\u00a0forming the new government.",
      "Salam vowed to \u201crestore confidence between citizens and the state, between\u00a0Lebanon\u00a0and its Arab surroundings, and between Lebanon and the international community\u201d and to implement reforms needed to bring the country out of an extended economic crisis.",
      "\u201cReform is the only path to a true salvation,\u201d he said in a speech on Saturday.",
      "He also promised to follow up on implementation of a ceasefire agreement that ended the most recent war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group and political party Hezbollah in late November and to ensure that Israeli forces \u201cwithdraw from Lebanese territory until the last inch.\u201d He pledged to ensure reconstruction in areas that suffered destruction during the war.",
      "Salam\u2019s cabinet of 24 ministers, split evenly between Christian and Muslim sects, was formed less than a month after he was appointed, and comes at a time where Lebanon is scrambling to rebuild its battered southern region and maintain security along its borders.",
      "Lebanon is also still in the throes of a crippling\u00a0economic crisis, now in its sixth year, which has battered its banks, destroyed its state electricity sector and left many in poverty unable to access their savings.",
      "Salam, a diplomat and former president of the International Court of Justice, has vowed to reform Lebanon\u2019s judiciary and battered economy and bring about stability in the troubled country, which has faced numerous economic, political, and security crises for decades.",
      "New government marks a shift away from Hezbollah",
      "Though Hezbollah did not endorse Salam as prime minister, the Lebanese group did engage in negotiations with the new prime minister over the Shiite Muslim seats in government, as per Lebanon\u2019s power-sharing system.",
      "That was despite comments by U.S. envoy Morgan Ortagus who said in a speech in Beirut Friday that Washington had \u201cset\u00a0clear red lines\u00a0from the United States\u201d that Hezbollah would not be \u201ca part of the government.\u201d The comments drew backlash from many in Lebanon who saw them as meddling in internal Lebanese affairs.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s new authorities also mark a shift away from leaders that are close to Hezbollah, as Beirut hopes to continue improving ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations that have been concerned by Hezbollah\u2019s growing political and military power over the past decade.",
      "In early January, former army chief Aoun was elected president, ending that position\u2019s vacuum. He was also a candidate not endorsed by Hezbollah and key allies.",
      "Aoun has shared similar sentiments to Salam, also vowing to consolidate the state\u2019s right to \u201cmonopolize the carrying of weapons,\u201d in an apparent reference to the arms of Hezbollah.",
      "Clashes on eastern border continue",
      "While the formation of a government appeared to be a sign of hope for the country\u2019s future stability, Lebanon is still facing a tense security situation on more than one front.",
      "Clashes broke out ongoing on the eastern border with Syria earlier this week between Lebanese clans and the security forces of the new Syrian government, which are largely made up of former members of the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.",
      "The porous border has long been a conduit for smuggling of people, weapons and drugs. Syrian officials said security forces were cracking down on smuggling gangs.",
      "The Lebanese army said Saturday that several Lebanese areas had been \u201csubjected to shelling and gunfire\u201d from Syria and that it had given orders for soldiers stationed in the border area to \u201crespond to sources of fire launched from Syrian territory.\u201d",
      "Ceasefire agreement extended",
      "Separately, six people were killed and two injured in an Israeli drone strike Saturday in the area of Janata, near the eastern border with Syria, Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency reported.",

      "Israel has continued to launch near-daily strikes on what it says are Hezbollah facilities in Lebanon since the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. The deal stipulates that both Israel and Lebanon maintain the right to act in \u201cself defense\u201d but does not define what qualifies as self defense.",

      "U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols\u00a0issued a pause on efforts to place 2,200 staff on administrative leave and to expedite evacuations for personnel abroad until next Friday at 11:59 p.m.",
      "He also rescinded leave for 500 workers already put on leave.",
      "\"All USAID employees currently on administrative leave shall be reinstated until that date, and shall be given complete access to email, payment, and security notification systems until that date, and no additional employees shall be placed on administrative leave before that date,\" Nichols wrote.",
      "Nichols also paused the administration's plans to impose a 30-day deadline for USAID personnel abroad to return the the United States, saying \"such short notice disrupts long-settled expectations and makes it nearly impossible for evacuated employees to adequately plan for their return to the United States.\"",
      "Nichols said he would not impose a pause on the funding freeze and scheduled an in-person preliminary injunction hearing for Wednesday.",
      "A spokesperson for Democracy Forward, a progressive nonprofit group that filed a lawsuit against the Office of Management and Budget that resulted in a judge temporarily halting the Trump administration's freeze on most federal grants and loans, said the organization is confident it will demonstrate standing.",
      "\u201cWe are confident our clients will be able to demonstrate standing with more fulsome briefing and are committed to continuing to use the legal process to protect the privacy of the American people and to uphold the rule of law,\u201d the spokesperson said.",

      "Follow live politics coverage here.",
      "The American Foreign Service Association, a union representing 1,800 foreign service officers working for USAID, and the American Federation of Government Employees\u00a0sued the Trump administration\u00a0Thursday after the administration said earlier this week that thousands of USAID employees would be placed on administrative leave as part of a broad maneuver by President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to start reshaping the federal government. USAID personnel abroad were given 30 days to return to the United States.",
      "The groups had asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction directing the administration to halt the shutdown, alleging that efforts to dissolve the foreign assistance agency \u201chave generated a global humanitarian crisis by abruptly halting the crucial work of USAID employees, grantees, and contractors.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Trump's efforts \u201cexceed presidential authority and usurp legislative authority conferred upon Congress by the Constitution,\u201d violating the separation of powers.",
      "\u201cNot a single one of defendants\u2019 actions to dismantle USAID were taken pursuant to congressional authorization. And pursuant to federal statute, Congress is the only entity that may lawfully dismantle the agency,\u201d the lawsuit says.",

The corruption is at levels rarely seen before. Close it down!\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has defended the planned staffing cuts at the agency, saying Thursday that the administration was \u201cnot trying to be disruptive to people\u2019s personal lives,\u201d but that the directive was \u201cthe only way we\u2019ve been able to get cooperation from USAID.\u201d",

      "Those programs along with others are part of the complex web of U.S. global assistance that addresses humanitarian needs and helps mitigate migration to the United States and other countries, by helping people become self-sustaining.",
      "The Trump administration has excoriated USAID programs as fraught with waste and abuse as they've virtually dismantled the agency, with President Donald Trump on Friday calling for it to be \"shut down.\" But those who have worked with USAID programs say they've had a role in preventing some migration \u2014\u00a0and could help Trump accomplish his goals of slashing illegal entries into the U.S. and controlling the border.",
      "\u201cWhat drives migration is lack of opportunity, lack of health services, a decent quality of life and knowing you can have a better one in a different place,\u201d said an official with knowledge of the USAID partnered program in Colombia that helps employ Venezuelans. He did not want to be identified for fear the program could be targeted.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge ordered a temporary pause of the Trump administration's planned administrative leave for thousands of USAID employees.",
      "Most Venezuelan refugees have migrated to other countries in Latin America: As of November, Colombia had taken in the most at about 2.8 million, according to the Interagency Coordination Platform for Refugees and Migrants. By contrast, about 600,000 Venezuelans are in the U.S. under temporary protected status, which Trump is eliminating.",
      "Migration is usually a product of many factors: economic downturns, political persecution, increased insecurity, violence perpetrated by criminal syndicates or domestic violence, along with a desire for better educational and economic opportunities, family ties and even love and marriage.",
      "But Trump has added a new push factor by cutting off money to programs that may have helped people in other countries survive or overcome those factors, according to people who work with relief groups.",
      "\"We have no problem with people saying I want to review this program. I think it's good and necessary,\" said Gabriel Salguero, pastor of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition who has participated in humanitarian assistance programs in many countries.",
      "But the lack of clarity and pause is putting people's lives at stake, he said. Some of the programs provide direct cash payments, according to the official overseeing USAID-funded programs in Latin America.",
      "Salguero said his group\u2019s phone line has been flooded with calls from people in the U.S. who help support the faith-based nonprofits around the world.",
      "\"Historically poverty has contributed to migration. Poverty and hunger contribute. I go back to the book of Genesis, there was a famine and God had to lead Joseph ... I don\u2019t think Jesus was playing around when he said, 'I was hungry and you gave me to eat,'\" Salguero said.",
      "Sustaining an \u2018economic chain\u2019 \u2014 and helping stem migration",
      "Emily Chambers Sharpe, director of global health and communications for World Relief, a Christian humanitarian group that receives USAID funding, said the group has procured about 4.3 million tons of seeds for beans that were about to be distributed to farmers to be planted.",
      "\u201cIf the farmers can plant those and get their crops, then they have food security; it\u2019s not so tempting to move away,\u201d Chambers Sharpe said.",
      "She's also met with fishermen in Haiti who \u201ctalked about how this assistance helps them prepare for hurricanes and cyclones that move through, and again, it helps keep people in Haiti, which is a hard place to want to stay in,\u201d she said.",
      "Those farmers and fishermen take their products to market and farmers can put aside seeds for next season, so the program provides longer-term support.",
      "Not getting the seeds or the fishing tools \u201ccuts them out of the economic chain when they are not able to get their supplies\u201d in time, Chambers Sharpe said.",
      "In his first term, Trump questioned the migration of people from Haiti, El Salvador and African nations, referring to those as \u201cshithole\u201d countries. In 2021, with President Joe Biden in charge, tens of thousands of Haitians arrived at the U.S. border, fleeing their country's political instability and violence. Controversy ensued when U.S. Border Patrol agents on horseback tried to drive out some who had already crossed the border. A Department of Homeland Security investigation found some agents used unnecessary force.",
      "Catholic Relief Services, which receives USAID funding, makes the connection between its work and migration in a document on its website that describes reasons people migrate from Central America to the U.S. It cites family-owned businesses being extorted by gangs and drug lords, young people left jobless because their neighborhoods are controlled by criminals, natural disasters and worsened climate conditions.",
      "\"CRS\u2019 work in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador addresses the root causes of flight to the U.S. We protect kids against trafficking, keep children in school and help youth stay out of gangs in some of the toughest neighborhoods,\" the document states. \"Programs like YouthBuild, for example, provide life, job skills and entrepreneurship training to youth who might otherwise be on the streets.\"",
      "The USAID overhaul is happening while there have been dramatic declines in arrivals at the southern border, a slide that began in the end of Biden\u2019s administration but that is significantly greater than in similar periods last year. As of Jan. 27, according to a U.S. official, the number of Southwest border encounters was 813, down from 833\u00a0the week before and compared with an average of 1,552 during the month of December.",
      "\"President Trump can simultaneously secure the southern border while identifying wasteful spending across the federal bureaucracy,\" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement to NBC News. \"He will cut programs that do not align with the agenda that the American people gave him a mandate in November to implement and keep programs that put America First.\"",

      "Years of clashes between FARC and Colombia\u2019s government contributed to Colombian migration to the United States. While peace between the two factions has made Colombia more stable, the country is still struggling.",
      "Laura Bonilla, the foundation\u2019s deputy director, said the organization, which received USAID funds, is \"very worried about this.\"",
      "Bonilla, who was tasked with monitoring the peace deal and post-conflict, said that during the initial negotiations between 2014 and 2016, as well as during the first part of the implementation of the peace agreement, Colombia had the lowest rate of violence and displacement in decades.",
      "\u201cAt that moment, migration was lower because people had a lot of expectations and hope that the situation was going to be better,\u201d Bonilla said. \u201cIf you have a country with lower rates of violence, then people don\u2019t want to emigrate.\u201d",
      "Latin America and the Caribbean receive\u00a0far less aid than other regions. In 2023, the region received $100 million, compared with  $1.6 billion for sub-Saharan Africa and $1.5 billion for Europe and Eurasia, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who now oversees USAID, has issued a waiver to Trump\u2019s executive order pausing USAID to allow continuations of\u00a0\u201clife-saving humanitarian assistance programs.\u201d",
      "Rubio has said that USAID did not cooperate with the administration in identifying programs that align with U.S. foreign policy, so the State Department is now combing through programs to find the ones that further national interests and end those that don't.",
      "\"This is not about ending foreign aid. It is about structuring it in a way that furthers the national interest of the United States,\" he said at a recent news conference in Guatemala.",
      "\"Not only is this a good idea, we owe it to the American taxpayer because this is taxpayer money. This is not a charity,\" he said.",
      "But Rubio's waiver prohibits migration and refugee assistance programs that provide lifesaving humanitarian aid and support repatriation of people to their country of origin or a third country, such as immigrants deported from the United States. It prohibits any programs it labels \u201cgender or DEI ideology programs, transgender surgeries or other non-life saving assistance.\u201d",
      "While Rubio's waiver may be allowing some of the work to restart, it also has program leaders scrambling to apply for waivers for programs, even as they may be laying off staff because money to pay them has been stopped.",
      "Chambers Sharpe said some groups had completed contracts and the next step was to report the completion of a program to USAID so the contractor could be paid, but with most of the staff at USAID on leave and its headquarters shut, there is no way to get those payments and no one to help them work through a contract or waiver process.",
      "The USAID program official who did not want to be identified said the prohibition on DEI programs also is confusing. Many of the poorest people or those most subjected to violence are from the LGBTQ, Afro Latino or Indigenous communities or are women. The help they give them is not predicated on their identity, but is focused on them because they are the most vulnerable.",

    "summary": "Countries including Canada and Germany said President Trump\u2019s decision to sanction the International Criminal Court would \u201cerode the international rule of law.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Dozens of countries, including Germany, South Africa and Mexico, said Friday that President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to sanction the International Criminal Court would \u201cerode the international rule of law.\u201d",
      "The joint statement by 79 countries came hours after Trump signed an executive order slapping financial sanctions and visa restrictions against ICC staff and their family members, alleging the court has improperly targeted the United States and Israel.",
      "\u201cSuch measures increase the risk of impunity for the most serious crimes and threaten to erode the international rule of law, which is crucial for promoting global order and security,\u201d the 79 countries, including Canada and France, said in a statement publicly released by numerous governments.",
      "The statement added that \u201csanctions could jeopardize the confidentiality of sensitive information and the safety of those involved\u2014including victims, witnesses, and court officials, many of whom are our nationals.\u201d",
      "The signatories said the sanctions may result in the ICC having to close its field offices.",
      "\"We regret any attempts to undermine the court\u2019s independence, integrity and impartiality,\" they said, crediting the \"ICC\u2019s indispensable role in ending impunity, promoting the rule of law, and fostering lasting respect for international law and human rights.\"",
      "The United States and Israel are among a minority of around 40 countries that never signed up to the ICC, an international court based in the Netherlands that seeks to hold to account the perpetrators of war crimes, like genocide.",
      "But after some historic cooperation between Washington and the ICC, Trump's executive order Thursday accused the world body of \u201cillegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.\u201d",
      "In November, the ICC issued\u00a0arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as for Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammad Deif and Ismail Haniyeh.",
      "The warrants relate to events on and since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorist attacks killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 others taken hostage, according to Israeli officials. Since, then Israel has launched a military offensive that has killed more than 47,500 people in the Gaza Strip, according to local health officials.",
      "The court said there was reason to believe Netanyahu and Gallant used \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeting civilians in Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza. Israel, which also does not recognize the ICC, dismissed those charges as false and antisemitic.",
      "The court's \"recent actions against Israel and the United States set a dangerous precedent, directly endangering current and former United States personnel, including active service members of the Armed Forces, by exposing them to harassment, abuse, and possible arrest,\" the executive order said.",
      "Its signing appeared timed to coincide with Netanyahu's visit to Washington, in which Trump made the surprise announcement that he wanted the U.S. to take control of the Gaza Strip, shocking and outraging many officials, activists and experts around the world.",
      "Washington\u2019s historical relationship with the ICC is a complex one.",
      "The administration of President Bill Clinton was involved in negotiating the 1998 Rome Statute on which the ICC is based. But the U.S. opposed the final draft because of fears it \u201ccould subject U.S. soldiers and officials to politicized prosecutions,\u201d according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "Clinton later signed the statute but asked it not be sent to the Senate for ratification until these concerns were addressed."

    "title": "Japanese leader arrives in Washington to sell Trump on the importance of Asian alliances",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 11:48:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 What a difference a few months makes.",
      "The United States and its longtime allies Japan and South Korea have been strengthening ties in recent years, both individually and as a three-way partnership, in an effort to counter an increasingly assertive China and North Korea. But recent political changes in Washington, Tokyo and Seoul have injected new uncertainty into their relations.",
      "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing an impeachment trial over his botched attempt in December to declare martial law, and it will be months before the country has a clear leader. In Japan, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is hamstrung by a minority government after his scandal-ridden Liberal Democratic Party performed poorly in an October parliamentary election.",
      "And in the United States, voters elected a president in November who has disdain for alliances and prefers to deal with countries individually, and who in his first term accused Japan and South Korea of \u201cfreeloading\u201d under the U.S. security umbrella.",
      "On Friday, Ishiba is set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, in the first major indication of how the new U.S. administration will interact with the two Asian democracies.",
      "Like the U.S., both countries are wary of China\u2019s rise but also count it among their top trading partners. The challenge for Ishiba will be to sell Trump on the importance of U.S. security commitments in Asia and avoid the kinds of tariffs that Trump has imposed on China and threatened to impose on U.S. allies Canada and Mexico.",
      "Ishiba said he planned \u201cto work hard to establish a relationship of mutual trust\u201d during his visit with Trump.",
      "\u201cI hope that we can confirm that by Japan and the U.S. cooperating on issues such as the economy and security, this will bring peace and allow for development not for the free and open Indo-Pacific region but also for the rest of the world,\u201d the Japanese leader told reporters in Tokyo on Thursday.",
      "Japanese visit",
      "Ishiba is looking for a \u201cneutral outcome\u201d from the visit, and is most likely just happy to be the second foreign leader to meet with Trump after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Michael Cucek, an assistant professor of Asian studies at Temple University in Japan.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not going to try to win any points or get any gifts from the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knows that there are none available.\u201d",
      "Ishiba is likely to emphasize Japan\u2019s role as the largest foreign investor in the U.S. \u2014 in December, Masayoshi Son, head of the Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, pledged to invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years at a meeting with Trump.",
      "Business ties with Japan have been strained by the $15 billion bid by its largest steelmaker, Nippon Steel, for Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, which then-President Joe Biden blocked last month citing national security concerns. Trump also opposes the deal, which Nippon Steel says it has not given up on.",
      "The blocking of the deal is unlikely to fundamentally alter the U.S.-Japan relationship, said Anthony Rapa, partner and co-chair of the International Trade practice group at Blank Rome in Washington, given both countries are more concerned with Indo-Pacific security and countering China.",
      "\u201cThat said, the rejection of the deal genuinely did sting, considering the historical closeness of the two nations, Japan\u2019s standing as the top U.S. investor, and the fact that no Japanese investment had ever been blocked on national security grounds before, at least not publicly,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "Takahiro Mori, vice chairman of Nippon Steel, said Thursday that the company would be watching the Ishiba-Trump summit closely and that he hoped it would be \u201ca catalyst that would open the way towards the future.\u201d",
      "Cucek said Ishiba would \u201cutterly avoid\u201d raising the topic with Trump, especially since Nippon Steel is suing over the blocking of the deal.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to bring it up,\u201d Cucek said. \u201cThere\u2019s no advantage that he gets out of it.\u201d",
      "Ishiba is unlikely to get along with Trump as well as Shinzo Abe, the former Japanese prime minister who was assassinated in 2022 and who had a close personal relationship with Trump. Cucek said that the current Japanese leader has a fundamentally different temperament from Abe \u2014 who won over Trump with a charm offensive that involved flattery and golf.",
      "\u201cNevertheless, in dealing with Donald Trump, he has this playbook from Abe of simply flattering the man,\u201d he said.",
      "Anxiety in South Korea",
      "In South Korea, there are worries that the country could be falling behind in engaging with the Trump administration because of the political instability after Yoon\u2019s short-lived martial law order.",
      "The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to decide whether Yoon, who is suspended from presidential duties after being impeached by lawmakers, should indeed be removed from office. If he is, South Korea would then have 60 days to hold a presidential by-election.",
      "Though Trump had a phone call with Yoon shortly after his election victory in November, he has not spoken with acting South Korean President Choi Sang-mok.",
      "\u201cThere is no way that Trump will actually engage directly\u201d with an acting president, said Jennifer Lee, a principal at the Asia Group in Washington who focuses on the Korean Peninsula.",
      "\u201cSo waiting six months to have that kind of highest-level meeting will definitely hurt the country,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially given the uncertainty around the Trump administration\u2019s policies.\u201d",
      "There has been other contact, however, including a phone call last month between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his South Korean counterpart, Cho Tae-yul, and a call Wednesday between national security adviser Mike Waltz and his South Korean counterpart, Shin Won-sik.",
      "One area where South Korea is eager to coordinate with the U.S. is North Korea, whose leader Kim Jong Un has been advancing his nuclear and ballistic missile programs and ratcheting up his hostile rhetoric against the U.S., South Korea and others.",
      "Trump has said he plans to reach out to Kim, whom he met with three times during his first term.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of anxiety, especially on them not being included in the possible U.S.-North Korea dialogue,\u201d said Lee, who recently returned from a trip to South Korea.",
      "Japan, which is also directly threatened by North Korea, shares a number of potential challenges with South Korea in a new Trump administration.",
      "Both countries host thousands of U.S. troops, and both countries came under pressure during Trump\u2019s first term to shoulder more of the cost for that.",
      "Tariffs are another potential concern, after Trump announced 25% tariffs on U.S. allies Canada and Mexico before putting them on hold at the last minute.\u00a0 South Korea, which has a highly export-dependent economy, is considered especially vulnerable, and South Korean companies such as Hyundai, Samsung and LG are exposed because of their facilities in Mexico and China, on which the U.S. imposed a 10% tariff Tuesday.",
      "Though both South Korea and Japan would be affected if Trump imposes a blanket tariff on all U.S. imports as he has floated, both Lee and Cucek said there is no obvious reason for them to be directly targeted the way Canada, Mexico and China were over their alleged roles in the U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing that provides the excuse for the use right now of tariffs,\u201d Cucek said.",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, Arata Yamamoto from Tokyo and Stella Kim from Seoul, South Korea."

    "summary": "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader rejected holding talks with Donald Trump, saying that experience shows it is \u201cnot rational, intelligent, or honorable\u201d to do so.",
    "story": [
      "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday rejected the idea of holding talks with the Trump administration, saying that experience had shown it was \u201cnot rational, intelligent, or honorable\u201d to do so.",
      "\u201cNegotiations with America do not solve any of our problems,\u201d Khamenei said in a speech Friday, according to the Iranian news agency Tasnim.",
      "Khamenei\u2019s comments came after Trump on Wednesday indicated a willingness to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran \u201cimmediately.\u201d Days earlier, the president renewed his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on Tehran, signing an executive order aimed at preventing it from obtaining nuclear weapons and eliminating its oil exports.",
      "\u201cWe will see whether or not we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be tough on Iran. We don\u2019t want to be tough on anybody,\" he added, expressing a preference for \u201ca Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper.\u201d",
      "The comments that Khamenei, 85, made in a speech to air force officers also appeared to contradict his own earlier remarks, in which he left the door open to discussions over whether Iran would be prepared to negotiate with the U.S. over enriching weapons-grade uranium and sanctions on billions of dollars worth of exports.",
      "In recent days, both sides have sent \"mixed messages\" as to whether they would engage in nuclear talks, said Darya Dolzikova\u200b, a research fellow with the proliferation and nuclear policy program at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cThe intention of [the U.S.] engaging in nuclear diplomacy with Iran is certainly a good one. I guess where the challenges come in is, when the rubber really hits the road, what does that actually look like?\u201d she told NBC News in a phone interview.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see what that looks like in practice,\u201d Dolzikova added.",
      "Both the White House and the Islamic Republic had this week signaled a change in tone from the first Trump administration, during which he withdrew from a 2015 pact intended to curb Iran's nuclear program signed by the Obama administration, and reinstated crippling sanctions.",
      "Shortly after, the U.S. withdrew from the deal in 2018, Iran violated the previously agreed-upon enrichment limitations.",
      "But Khamenei pointed to that history Friday, saying that Iran had made \u201cmany concessions\u201d with the U.S. in the 2010s, but that in the end, \u201cAmericans did not honor the deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur government at the time engaged in negotiations, held meetings, had discussions, smiled, shook hands, and built relationships,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe very person who is now in power tore up the agreement.\u201d",
      "While both European and American officials have since attempted to engage with Iran on the issue of nuclear proliferation, those talks have rarely, if ever, ended with a mutually satisfactory outcome.",
      "Trump's executive order Tuesday also triggered a response from Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who told the Iranian news agency Tasmin on Wednesday that \u201cmaximum pressure is a failed experience, and repeating it will lead to another failure.\"",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also played down the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran. On Wednesday, he urged\u00a0fellow members of the\u00a0Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to unite against possible U.S. sanctions on the major oil producer, later saying that \u201cIran is a powerful and resource-rich country that can navigate challenges by managing its resources.\u201d",
      "Iranian officials in recent days have repeatedly claimed the country isn't actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, reiterating that it is a signatory of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, an international agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and technology.",
      "While Iran has not yet pursued building a nuclear bomb, a 2023 report released by watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency\u00a0found the country had begun enriching uranium close to weapons-grade levels.",
      "Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, Trump indicated that the executive order he signed this week was intended to deter Iran from further developing its nuclear capabilities.",
      "\u201cWe will once again enforce the most aggressive possible sanctions to drive Iranian oil exports to zero and diminish the regime\u2019s capacity to fund terror throughout the region and through the world,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, despite American efforts to target Iran's economy, RUSI's Dolzikova said that the use of sanctions is \u201cprobably not as strong of a lever as it will have been four or five years ago,\u201d because the Iranian economy has since adapted to the pressure by expanding its relations with Russia and China.",
      "She added that \u201cif the Trump administration does go after those continued exports to China, as they seem set to do, then that might create additional pressure.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order sanctioning the International Criminal Court, accusing the body of improperly targeting the United States and Israel.",
      "The order includes both financial sanctions and visa restrictions against unspecified ICC officials and their family members found to have assisted in investigations of U.S. citizens or allies. NBC News previously reported on the contents of the order in a fact sheet it obtained.",
      "Last November, the ICC sparked bipartisan backlash in Washington by issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant\u00a0and several Hamas leaders simultaneously. The Trump administration order claims this created a \u201cshameful moral equivalency.\u201d",
      "The court said there was reason to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant used \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeting civilians in Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza \u2014 charges Israeli officials dismissed as false and antisemitic.",
