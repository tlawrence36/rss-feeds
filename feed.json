      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered his 11th studio album, \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d",
      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d his eleventh studio album that leans into some well-tread country rock territory, the kind that invariably involves broken hearts, trucks and a cold beer.",
      "Look, Bentley knows what he\u2019s doing. The album is 11-tracks of catchy, country rock radio filler and there\u2019s not much mystery to its musical roadmap. But therein lies his calling card: Dependable songs with few rough edges.",
      "Thematically, many of the tracks on the superstar\u2019s latest effort hint at internal struggles, but allow Bentley and the listener to escape them unscathed. \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d is an admirable acoustic slow burn about finding religion but losing a woman. \u201cThought maybe if I hit my knees / She\u2019d think about hitting the brakes,\u201d Bentley sings. There is slight salvation for the Phoenix-born singer: \u201cYeah, Jesus loves me / But she don't.\u201d",
      "On the title track, the jukebox stomp \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d Bentley gets a nice assist from fellow country hitmakers John Anderson and Riley Green. Ostensibly it\u2019s an energetic drinking song about family lines, but lyrics like \u201cWe shoulda gone to college / Coulda gained a little knowledge,\u201d which pull from a popular childhood rhyme, feel like they're underperforming.",
      "What Bentley does extremely well is execute what his \u2014 and the modern genre\u2019s \u2014 biggest fans might expect. Tales of a tough exterior with a warm, if fragile, heart underneath. But his familiar is derivative.",
      "Palatable country is how you get on the radio and stay on it. Songs about beer and trucks are Spotify deliverables. If you like your country artists with a longer rap sheet, you\u2019ll need to look further than \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d Even the few attempts at invention don't totally land, like the rowdy, rocking \u201cShe Hates Me,\u201d which includes a surprising interpolation of post-grunge band Puddle of Mudd\u2019s 2001 hit \u201cShe (Expletive) Hates Me.\u201d",
      "If there\u2019s a pleasant find here, it\u2019s Stephen Wilson Jr. duetting with Bentley on the opening track, \u201cCold Beer Can.\u201d It\u2019s the most memorable song on the album \u2014 with its plucky instrumentation and ascendant chorus, which showcase Wilson Jr.\u2019s rich voice and guitar talents.",
      "It also does what Bentley aims for, but misses, throughout the record: It addresses life's touching moments over brews.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Beach Boys' Mike Love was inducted into the 2025 Songwriters Hall of Fame on Thursday night, just one day after it was announced that his inimitable bandmate Brian Wilson had died.",
      "The actor \u2014 and lifelong Beach Boys fan \u2014 John Stamos introduced him. \u201cThere are songs that don't just play on the radio,\u201d Stamos said in his speech. \u201cMike Love is a songwriter's songwriter.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat an incredible honor this is,\u201d Clinton said in his speech. He talked about his early days in the legendary Brill Building song factory, which he described like going \u201cinto Oz.\u201d Being a songwriter, to him, required \u201cconsistent effort.\u201d",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up chasing fame,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up chasing feeling ... Creativity has no limitations.\u201d",
      "His four children, R.J., Heavenly, Hannah Joy and Royal Jerkins, performed one of his best-known hits, Brandy and Monica's \u201cThe Boy Is Mine.\"",

      "When Gorley took the stage for his speech, he said he felt like he was in a \u201cfever dream\u201d or that he has \u201ccrashed a royal wedding.\u201d",
      "Legendary English songwriter Tony Macaulay was also honored. He is best known for such classics as The Foundations\u2019 \u201cBaby Now That I\u2019ve Found You\" and \u201cBuild Me Up Buttercup,\u201d the latter of which was performed for Macaulay by a spirited Debbie Gibson.",

      "Gracie Abrams received the eminent Hal David Starlight Award.",
      "Last year\u2019s inductees included Steely Dan, R.E.M., Timbaland, Hillary Lindsey and Dean Pitchford. At the induction ceremony last summer, R.E.M. stunned attendees by reuniting for an acoustic version of their alt-rock hit, \u201cLosing My Religion.\u201d",
      "The Songwriters Hall of Fame was established in 1969 to honor those creating popular music. A songwriter with a notable catalog of songs qualifies for induction 20 years after the first commercial release of a song. Some already in the hall include Gloria Estefan, Carole King, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, Elton John and Bernie Taupin, Brian Wilson, James Taylor, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Lionel Richie, Bill Withers, Neil Diamond and Phil Collins.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Recording Academy has tweaked some of its rules for the 2026 Grammy Awards, including carving out a stand-alone category for best album cover \u2014 a day after Sabrina Carpenter sparked considerable discourse unveiling what is believed to be the cover for her next album.",
      "The academy on Thursday announced that the best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories will be combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own. The last Grammy for best recording package went to \u201cBrat,\u201d the Charli xcx album whose distinctive cover was immediately embraced by pop culture and meme creators.",
      "\u201cThe Academy\u2019s top priority is to represent the music people that we serve each year,\u201d Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy said in a statement. \u201cThat entails listening carefully to our members to make sure our rules and guidelines reflect today\u2019s music and allow us to accurately recognize as many deserving creators as possible.\u201d",

      "Willie Nelson is busy as ever at age 92",
      "Willie Nelson's 90th birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl could have been mistaken for a retirement party.",
      "But two years later at 92, he's working as much as ever. Not that retirement would look much different. The life he loves is making music with his friends, even after outliving so many dear ones.",
      "Nelson will be on the road again with Bob Dylan when the Outlaw Music Festival resumes for the second leg of its 10th year starting on June 20 in Clarkston, Michigan",
      "Asked if he\u2019d ever like his life to get the feature film treatment that Dylan did last year with \u201cA Complete Unknown, \u201d Nelson said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard some talk about it. But I'm not through with it yet.\u201d",
      "Nelson spoke to The Associated Press in a phone interview from Hawaii's Oahu.",
      "\u201cBob's a good friend,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAnd I'll be glad to let him headline.\u201d",
      "The tour is one part of a loaded year. It'll lead right up to the 40th anniversary of Farm Aid in September. This spring, Nelson released his 77th studio album. And he's added a new THC tonic, Willie's Remedy, to his wide world of weed products.",
      "Nelson has always loved singing the songs of his friends as much as if not more than the ones he writes himself. In 1979, he released \u201cWillie Nelson Sings Kristofferson,\u201d a full album of the work of his friend Kris Kristofferson, who died last year.",
      "He has similar love for the songs of his friend Rodney Crowell. Nelson has long performed Crowell's \u201cTil I Gain Control Again,\u201d which he called \u201cone of the best country songs that I think I've ever heard.\u201d Now he's released a whole album of Crowell tunes, \u201cOh What a Beautiful World.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far he hasn\u2019t written one that I don\u2019t like,\u201d Nelson said.",
      "The album comes on the 50th anniversary of \u201cRed Headed Stranger,\u201d the album that many consider Nelson's masterpiece. A breakthrough for him at age 42, it took him from respected journeyman to beloved superstar.",
      "Nelson said he's already begun work on album number 78, but declines to share its direction.",
      "As Nelson returns to the road, the only surviving member of the classic lineup of his Family band is Mickey Raphael, 73, whose harmonica has duetted for decades with the Willie warble.",
      "Bassist Bee Spears died in 2011. Guitarist and backup singer Jody Payne died in 2013. Drummer Paul English died in 2020. And Nelson's sister Bobbie Nelson, his only sibling and his piano player, died in 2022.",
      "But the band he takes on the road now is just as familial in its own way. It often includes his sons Lukas and Micah. English's brother Billy plays the drums. The son of Payne and singer Sammi Smith, Waylon Payne, plays guitar.",
      "They collectively keep up with Nelson's wants and whims on stage. One thing the live show never includes is a set list. He refuses to use them. Band members \u2014 and sound guys, and lighting guys \u2014 have to stay on their toes and be ready for anything.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather play it off the top of my head, because I can read the crowd pretty good,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThey jump in there.\u201d",
      "The list-less set lately has included classics like \u201cWhiskey River\u201d (always the opener, no guessing to be done there,) and \u201cBloody Mary Morning\u201d along with newer adoptees like Tom Waits' \u201cLast Leaf,\u201d a song that perfectly expresses Nelson's survivor status.",
      "\u201cI'm the last leaf on the tree,\u201d Nelson sings in the song that leads his 2024 album of the same name. \u201cThe autumn took the rest, but it won't take me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy son Micah found that for me,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI really love the song, and the audience likes it, it\u2019s one of the real good ones.\u201d",
      "He's also been performing songs written by Micah, who records and performs as Particle Boy.",
      "One favorite, \u201cEverything Is B- - - - - -t,\u201d seems to stand in contrast to the gospel standards like \u201cI'll Fly Away\u201d and \u201cWill The Circle Be Unbroken\u201d that he often plays a few minutes later. Willie disagrees.",
      "\u201cIt's all gospel,\u201d he says with a laugh.",
      "September will bring the 40th anniversary addition of Farm Aid, the annual festival to support family farmers, which Nelson founded with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, He performs there annually. It was inspired by one-off charity concerts like \u201cLive Aid,\u201d but became an annual institution, rotating each year to a different farm-adjacent city. It's in Minneapolis this year.",

      "Thanks to an agreement with the International Olympic Committee, the renamed marvel will now lift off into the sky each summer evening \u2014 a ghostly echo of last year\u2019s opening ceremony \u2014 from June 21 to Sept. 14, for the next three years.",
      "Gone is the official \u201cOlympic\u201d branding \u2014 forbidden under IOC reuse rules \u2014 but not the spectacle. The 30-meter-tall (98-foot-tall) floating ring, dreamed up by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur and powered by French energy company EDF, simulates flame without fire: LED lights, mist jets and high-pressure fans create a luminous halo that hovers above the city at dusk, visible from rooftops across the capital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those monuments in Paris that could stay,\u201d said Laurent Bro\u00e9ze, a local architect pausing in the gardens on Thursday. \u201cIt was set up temporarily, but a bit like the Eiffel Tower, it makes sense for it to return. It\u2019s a bit of a shame they want to take it down later, but maybe it could be installed somewhere else, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Though it stole the show in 2024, the cauldron\u2019s original aluminum-and-balloon build was only meant to be temporary \u2014 not engineered for multiyear outdoor exposure.",
      "To transform it into a summer staple, engineers reinforced it: The aluminum ring and tether points were rebuilt with tougher components to handle rain, sun and temperature changes over several seasons.",
      "A\u00e9rophile, Paris\u2019s tethered balloon specialist, redesigned the winch and tether system to meet aviation rules, allowing safe operation in winds up to 20\u201325 kph (12-15 mph).",
      "Hydraulic, electrical, and misting systems were fortified \u2014 not only to ensure smooth nightly flights but to endure months of wear and tear untested on the original design. These retrofits shift the cauldron from a fragile, one-off spectacle to a resilient, summerlong landmark \u2014 prepared to withstand everything Paris summers can throw at it.",
      "The structure first dazzled during the Paris 2024 Games, ignited on July 26 by Olympic champions Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec and Teddy Riner. Over just 40 days, it drew more than 200,000 visitors, according to officials.",
      "Now perched in the center of the drained Tuileries pond, the cauldron\u2019s return is part of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s effort to preserve the Games\u2019 spirit in the city, as Paris looks ahead to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "Visitors have already begun to gather.",
      "\u201cBeautiful,\u201d said Javier Smith, a tourist from Texas. \u201cAnd the place where it\u2019s going to be, or is sitting now, it\u2019s beautiful. All these beautiful buildings, the Louvre, all that is fantastic.\u201d",
      "Access is free and unticketed. The cauldron will be on display from morning to night, igniting with light from 10 a.m. and lifting off each evening after the garden closes \u2014 10:30 p.m. in June and July, with earlier times through September. It will float above the city for several hours before quietly descending around 1 a.m.",
      "The \u201cflame,\u201d while entirely electric, still conjures a sense of Olympic poetry.",
      "\u201cYes, we came for a little outing focused on the statues related to mythology in the Tuileries Garden,\u201d said Chlo\u00e9 Solana, a teacher visiting with her students. \u201cBut it\u2019s true we\u2019re also taking advantage of the opportunity, because last week the Olympic cauldron wasn\u2019t here yet, so it was really nice to be able to show it to the students.\u201d",
      "The cauldron\u2019s ascent may become a new rhythm of the Parisian summer, with special flights planned for Bastille Day on July 14 and the anniversary of the 2024 opening ceremony on July 26.",
      "It no longer carries the Olympic name. But this phoenix-like cauldron is still lifting Paris into the clouds \u2014 and into memory.",

      "House Republicans will look to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration seeks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are moving to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump's administration looks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk.",
      "The package to be voted on Thursday targets foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides money for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, as well as thousands of public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "Republicans are characterizing the spending as wasteful and unnecessary, but Democrats say the rescissions are hurting the United States' standing in the world.",
      "\u201cCruelty is the point,\u201d Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said of the proposed spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is employing a tool rarely used in recent years that allows the president to transmit a request to Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds. That triggers a 45-day clock in which the funds are frozen pending congressional action. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands.",
      "The benefit for the administration of a formal rescissions request is that passage requires only a simple majority in the 100-member Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to get spending bills through that chamber. So, if they stay united, Republicans will be able to pass the measure without any Democratic votes.",
      "The administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.",
      "Republicans, sensitive to concerns that Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill would increase future federal deficits, are anxious to demonstrate spending discipline, though the cuts in the package amount to just a sliver of the spending approved by Congress each year. They are betting the cuts prove popular with constituents who align with Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideology as well as those who view NPR and PBS as having a liberal bias.",
      "In all, the package contains 21 proposed rescissions. Approval would claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs. That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The Trump administration is also looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The Republican president has also asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s slated to receive during the next two budget years. About two-thirds of the money gets distributed to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the Republican measure passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Advocacy groups that serve the world's poorest people are also sounding the alarm and urging lawmakers to vote no.",
      "\u201cWe are already seeing women, children and families left without food, clean water and critical services after earlier aid cuts, and aid organizations can barely keep up with rising needs,\u201d said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, a poverty-fighting organization.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the foreign aid is a tool that prevents conflict and promotes stability but the measure before the House takes that tool away.",
      "\u201cThese cuts will lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, devastating the most vulnerable in the world,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAnd at a time when China and Russia and Iran are working overtime to challenge American influence.\u201d",
      "Republicans disparaged the foreign aid spending and sought to link it to programs they said DOGE had uncovered.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said taxpayer dollars had gone to such things as targeting climate change, promoting pottery classes and strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Other Republicans cited similar examples they said DOGE had revealed.",
      "\u201cYet, my friends on the other side of the aisle would like you to believe, seriously, that if you don't use your taxpayer dollars to fund this absurd list of projects and thousands of others I didn't even list, that somehow people will die and our global standing in the world will crumble,\u201d Roy said. \"Well, let's just reject this now.\u201d",

      "Sometimes death, as life, brings strange symmetries",
      "Sometimes there are strange symmetries in death, as in life. The twin passings of Sly Stone and Brian Wilson this week brought that into sharp relief.",
      "Both were musical geniuses who paid a high price for their gifts. They burned bright, with art they created at their peaks that became more moving and meaningful with time, only to see their creative lights extinguished suddenly through mental health and addiction issues. Both were 82 when they died \u2014 Stone on Monday and Wilson on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's such an unsettling coincidence,\u201d said Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. \u201cThese two figures, they were very different and massively influential, and each ran into a wall of their own problems in many ways. As much as they achieved, it's hard not to think that they could have done more.\u201d",
      "With his late brothers Carl and Dennis, Beach Boys co-founder Wilson was the architect of the California sound that captured surfing and sun, beaches and girls. Yet for all the \u201cFun, Fun, Fun,\u201d there was something much deeper and darker in Brian's abilities as a composer.",
      "It was more than disposable music for teen-agers. He had an unparalleled melodic sense, hearing sounds in his mind that others couldn't. He could worm his way into your head and then break your heart with songs like \u201cIn My Room\u201d and \u201cGod Only Knows.\u201d The tour de force \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d \u2014- had anyone ever heard of the theremin before he employed its unearthly wail? \u2014 is a symphony both complex and easily accessible.",
      "\u201cHe was our American Mozart,\u201d musician Sean Ono Lennon wrote on social media.",
      "The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was a peak. Wilson felt a keen sense of competition with the Beatles. But they had three writers, including Sean's dad, John Lennon. Wilson was largely alone, and he heard impatience and doubt from other Beach Boys, whose music he provided.",
      "He felt the pressure in trying to follow up \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and \u201cSmile\u201d became music's most famous unfinished album. Wilson, a damaged soul to begin with because of an abusive father, never reached the heights again. He descended into a well-chronicled period of darkness.",
      "Stone's skills came in creating a musical world that others only dreamed of at the time. The Family Stone was an integrated world \u2014 Black and white, men and women \u2014 and the music they created was a potent mixture of rock, soul and funk. It made you move, it made you think.",
      "For a period of time from 1967 to 1973, their music was inescapable \u2014 \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d \u201cEverybody is a Star,\u201d \u201cHigher,\u201d \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime,\u201d \u201cSing a s Simple Song,\u201d \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).\u201d Their performance at Woodstock was a milestone.",
      "\u201cHis songs weren't just about fighting injustice, they were about transforming the self to transform the world,\u201d musician and documentarian Questlove, who lovingly tended to Stone's legacy, wrote this week. \u201cHe dared to be simple in the most complex ways \u2014 using childlike joy, wordless cries and nursery rhyme cadences to express adult truths. His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.\u201d",
      "From his peak, the fall was hard. Years of drug abuse took its toll. Periodic comeback attempts deepened a sense of bewilderment and pity.",
      "Music is littered with stories of sudden, untimely and early deaths. Yet until this week, both men lived on, somewhat improbably passing average life expectancies.",
      "Wilson, by many measures, achieved some level of peace late in life. He had a happy marriage. He was able to see how his music was revered and appreciated and spent several years performing it again with a younger band that clearly worshiped him. It was a postscript not many knew, said journalist Jason Fine, who befriended Wilson and made the 2021 documentary, \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat sort of simple message he really wanted to give people through his music going back to the \u201860s \u2014 a sense of warmth, a sense that it\u2019s going to be OK in the same way that music lifted him up from his darkness, he'd try to do for other people,\u201d Fine told The Associated Press in an interview then. \u201cI think now, more than earlier in his career, he accepts that he does that and that's a great comfort to him.\u201d",
      "Stone emerged to write an autobiography in 2023. But less is known about his later years, whether he found peace or died without the full knowledge of what his music meant to others.",
      "\u201cYes, Sly battled addiction,\u201d Questlove wrote. \u201cYes, he disappeared from the spotlight. But he lived long enough to outlast many of his disciples, to feel the ripples of his genius return through hip-hop samples, documentaries and his memoir. Still, none of that replaces the raw beauty of his original work.\u201d",
      "Did Sly Stone and Brian Wilson live lives of tragedy or triumph? It's hard to say now. One suspects it will become easier with the passage of time, when only the work remains. That sometimes brings clarity.",
      "\u201cMillions of people had their lives changed by their music,\u201d DeCurtis said. \u201cNot just enjoyed it, but had their lives transformed. That's quite an accomplishment.\u201d",

      "A spokesperson for Fox News Channel did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "The vice president's office does not release a schedule for Vance and did not offer advance notice of the trip, so the surprise arrival of Air Force Two in Butte, Montana, set off local speculation as his motorcade was seen driving away.",
      "The Murdoch ranch near Dillon is roughly 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Butte. The ranch, which Murdoch purchased in 2021, is spread across two valleys and a mountain range and has some 12,000 cattle. It sits near Yellowstone National Park along the Montana-Idaho border.",

      "Vance was scheduled to have lunch with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, according to the president's publicly released schedule, meaning the vice president presumably returned to Washington shortly after meeting the Murdochs 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) away on Tuesday night.",

      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

      "German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, one of the country\u2019s most important post-war artists who was world-famous for his large-format nail reliefs, has died",
      "BERLIN -- German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, one of the country's most important post-war artists who was world-famous for his large-format nail reliefs, has died. He was 95.",
      "German news agency dpa reported that his family confirmed he died at the university hospital in his hometown of D\u00fcsseldorf in western Germany Tuesday night. They did not give a cause of death.",
      "For decades, Uecker, who was often dubbed \u201cthe nail artist,\u201d created art by hammering carpenter\u2019s nails into chairs, pianos, sewing machines and canvases. His works can be found in museums and collections across the globe.",
      "In his art work, seemingly endless numbers of nails, which would by themselves perhaps be perceived as potentially aggressive and hurtful, turned into harmonic, almost organic creations. His reliefs with the tightly hewn nails are reminiscent of waving grasses or fields of algae in a marine landscape.",
      "Uecker himself described his nail art as diary-like landscapes of the soul, which he called an \u201cexpression of the poetic power of man,\u201d dpa reported.",
      "Hendrik W\u00fcst, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia which includes state capital D\u00fcsseldorf, called Uecker \u201cone of the most important and influential artists in German post-war history\u201d and said that with his life\u2019s work, he influenced generations of young artists and \u201ccontributed to an open and dynamic society.\"",
      "Born on March 13, 1930, in the village of Wendorf on the Baltic Sea, Uecker moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in the mid-1950s, where he studied and later also taught at the city's prestigious art academy.",
      "In one of his most spectacular appearances or art happenings, he rode on the back of a camel through the hallways of the venerable academy in 1978. Together with fellow artist Gerhard Richter, he \u201coccupied\u201d the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden museum in 1968, with both kissing in front of the cameras.",
      "The son of a farmer, he traveled the world with a humanitarian message of peace and exhibited in countless countries, including dictatorships and totalitarian states. He painted ash pictures after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and exhibited human rights messages painted on fabric in Beijing.",
      "He also painted \u201cVerletzungsw\u00f6rter,\u201d or words of violence, killing and torment in many languages and foreign scripts on large canvases. In 2023, Uecker erected a stone memorial in Weimar in memory of the victims of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald.",
      "\u201cThe theme of my artistic work is the vulnerability of man by man,\u201d he said.",

      "The \u201cbones\u201d of Theo Jansen\u2019s \u201cstrandbeesten\u201d \u2014 beach animals in Dutch \u2014 have taken over a former cable factory in Delft, the small city in the western Netherlands that Jansen has called home for decades.",
      "\u201cDuring the years, there has been a sort of evolutionary history, you could say. And you could see these animals as sort of natural historical objects,\u201d the 77-year old artist told The Associated Press before the installation\u2019s opening.",
      "The Strandbeesten Mortuary, as the exhibition is called, follows the various versions of the mobile sculptures since 1990 when Jansen created the first one from plastic pipes and tape. As the animals evolved, Jansen incorporated plastic bottles, wooden planks, cloth and cardboard.",
      "The life and death cycle of these famous animals \u2014 formed mostly out of PVC pipes \u2014 has left behind an impressive fossil record, which is on display at the exhibition.",
      "Marloes Koster, who organized the exhibition for Delft\u2019s Prinsenhof Museum, said that Jansen\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a beast that will live forever.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not there yet, so these are the ones that didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she added.",
      "The museum is undergoing major renovations, so Koster and her colleagues have been putting together arts and culture events at alternative venues around the city while the building is shut.",
      "Born near the North Sea, Jansen grew up captivated by the wind that often hits the Dutch coastline. He harnessed it to allow his animals to \u201cwalk\u201d along the beach. Every year, he creates a new strandbeest and, at the end of the summer, declares the animal dead.",
      "\u201cAll summer I do experiments, and in the fall I\u2019m a little bit wiser (about) how these animals should survive in the future,\u201d Jansen said.",
      "Many of the visitors to the opening of the exhibition had followed Jansen\u2019s work for years and were keen to understand how the strandbeesten had changed over time.",
      "\u201cYou see a kind of development in the way he does things. So they start out very simple, and then it gets increasingly complicated. So they evolve,\u201d said Cor Nonhof, a Delft local who had come to see the exhibition with his wife.",
      "Even at the opening, Jansen was already keen to return to the beach to work on the latest evolution of his strandbeesten.",
      "\u201cI cannot do anything else,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cAnd I am very happy with that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "So he went to a megachurch youth group, which promised teenage shenanigans without much danger. The \u201csanitized mischief,\u201d as he describes it, was perfect for Morris, who grew up as a nerdy, nervous kid.",
      "\u201cYouth group was great for me,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe can put on a show, we can sing little songs, we can do little skits.

      "Morris also said he\u2019d rarely seen stories set in the kind of youth group he\u2019d grown up in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just never seen that little world written about in a way that I thought was like, accurate or, like, that got what it was about,\u201d he said.",
      "Published last year by New York-based First Second Books, \u201cYouth Group\u201d tells the story of Kay Radford, a theater kid who winds up joining the Stone Mission megachurch youth group after her parents split up. Her mom is a true believer but lonely. Kay is more skeptical but lonely as well and angry at her dad.",
      "\u201cChurch might help with all this,\u201d Kay\u2019s mom tells her early on. \u201cI think we both could use some community.\u201d",
      "At the youth group, Kay is met by youth leader Meg Parks, a kind but sometimes over-the-top youth leader in pink; a bearded, hippy pastor who turns the \u201cPina Colada song\u201d \u2014 the Rupert Holmes hit \u201cEscape\u201d \u2014 into a metaphor for spiritual seeking; and a band that churns out parodies like \u201cI Saw the Christ\u201d sung to the melody of Ace of Base\u2019s \u201cThe Sign.\u201d",
      "Though fictional, the songs fit the kind of pop culture reference \u2014 sometimes known as a \u201cJesus juke\u201d \u2014 that youth groups can be known for.",
      "\u201cI always think there\u2019s something funny about that move, where you take a secular piece of entertainment, like a song that\u2019s in the zeitgeist, or a popular movie and try and give the hidden religious message,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Kay eventually discovers the youth pastor and some of the older Stone Mission kids also fight demons. That fight becomes personal after one of the demons goes after her dad, and Kay decides to join the battle. Along the way, the Stone Mission kids team up with youth groups from other faiths \u2014 Temple Beth Israel, Immaculate Heart parish and the Polaris Coven \u2014 to fight off a demon invasion with the help of some training by an order of nuns.",
      "Morris said he and illustrator Bowen McCurdy wanted to tell a story that was more than just satire. And while he no longer embraces the faith of his youth, Morris still sees value in the lessons he learned, like the importance of loving your neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to tell a story of people from a lot of different religions coming together with a common goal,\u201d he said.",
      "Matthew Cressler, a religion scholar and creator of the webcomic series \u201cBad Catholics, Good Trouble,\u201d said comics with evangelical or denominational settings like \u201cYouth Group\u201d are uncommon. Religion in comics, he said, is often seen as \u201ca marker of difference\u201d: for example, Kamala Khan, the Muslim-American hero known as Ms. Marvel, or Matt Murdock, better known as Daredevil, who is Irish-Catholic. In the 1960s, when Daredevil was created, Catholics were still seen as outsiders to the American mainstream, and many of the most popular heroes, like Batman, were seen as Mainline Protestants.",
      "While there were comics for evangelicals, they were often evangelistic, like the controversial Jack Chick tracts or the Christianized adventures of Archie and his friends, published by Spire Comics starting in the 1970s. And evangelicals have often downplayed the kind of sacramental imagery and architecture found in mainline or Catholic settings and try to avoid the kind of visuals needed for comics, said Cressler.",
      "Matthew Brake, founder and editor of online publication Pop Culture and Theology, said non-denominational churches often have a \u201clet\u2019s go to the mall aesthetic\u201d and lack the visual clout of Catholicism.",
      "\u201cNondenominational churches are sort of a cultural underdog,\u201d he said.",
      "That may change, Brake said, as creators like Morris, who grew up in non-denominational settings, come of age. And those settings often contain surprises. Although they are most known for things like worship music and purity culture, megachurches also provide space to talk about things like social justice.",
      "Still, he wonders if many nondenominational Christians would be the kinds of fans that would enjoy a book like \u201cYouth Group\u201d or \u201cPreacher,\u201d a late-1990s comic about an evangelical pastor who ends up possessed by a supernatural being.",
      "David Canham, who reviews comics for the secular pop-culture website AIPT \u2014 short for \u201cAdventures in Poor Taste\u201d \u2014 had mixed feelings about \u201cYouth Group.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst off, there\u2019s plenty of \u201990s nostalgia \u2014 a good-natured tongue-in-cheek look back at many of the silly and absurd things about \u201990s culture, with a focus on evangelical Christian culture,\u201d he wrote when the book came out. \u201c\u2018Youth Group\u2019 delivers on this point.\u201d",
      "But the book\u2019s take on pluralism \u2014 the idea that all religion is on the same side \u2014 turned him off as an evangelical Christian. \u201cI don\u2019t want to recommend a book that promotes a worldview that so strongly disagrees with my own beliefs,\u201d he wrote.",
      "At first, Morris said he was worried the book might offend Christians and atheists alike. Some evangelicals might feel the book mocks their faith, while atheists might think the book overlooks the shortcomings of religious groups.",
      "Both those criticisms would be fair, he said. Religious groups get a lot of things wrong, and yet churches and other faith groups remain important to their members. Morris said he tried to walk a fine line of gently poking fun at faith while showing why it still has an impact on people\u2019s lives, and how the friendships made in youth groups may long endure.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want the humor to be like, church is stupid, or say, \u2018look at this dumb church stuff,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be funny and familiar.\u201d",
      "Morris said he wanted to capture the mixed feelings people have about the faiths in which they grew up. While he appreciated Bible teachings like caring for the needy, some of the politics and social messages, especially about LGBTQ+ folks, were a turnoff, he said.",
      "Religion, he said, is complicated.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of wonderful memories, and there\u2019s a lot of stuff that gives me the ick,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s in the book. I hope you can see how a religious upbringing can be upsetting and wonderful \u2014 comforting but also makes you mad.\u201d",

      "YEONCHEON, South Korea -- Hundreds of fans gathered in the early morning hours to catch a glimpse of K-pop superstars Jimin and Jung Kook, the latest and final members of BTS to be discharged from South Korea\u2019s mandatory military service.",
      "The pair wore their military uniforms Wednesday, saluted and addressed fans who had assembled to see the pair after their discharge.",
      "Jung Kook thanked the journalists and fans who traveled to see him and Jimin after their discharge and acknowledged how different it was to be back in the spotlight. \u201cActually, it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been in front of cameras, and I didn\u2019t even put on makeup, so I\u2019m a bit embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d",
      "The pair enlisted in December 2023, one day after RM and V did the same. The latter were discharged on Tuesday.",
      "Supporters traveled from around the world to the public sports ground where the meet-and-greet took place. It was moved from the military base\u2019s gate for safety reasons. Color-wrapped buses bearing BTS members\u2019 faces lined the streets while red and yellow balloons floated above and a decorated food truck provided free coffee and water, adding to the festive atmosphere.",
      "Many supporters wore masks, conscious of potential backlash after the band\u2019s label discouraged attendance citing safety concerns. Despite the challenges, fans like Anaesi from Portugal said the 20-hour journey to Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, was worth it.",
      "\u201cPortugal is a small country, but inside of Portugal, BTS is a king,\u201d she said. Anaesi, who discovered BTS on YouTube, said the group \u201csaved\u201d her from depression. \u201cSo for me BTS is my angel,\u201d she said. She displayed a colorful upper arm tattoo featuring a golden shield emblazoned with \u201cARMY\u201d and an eagle above it, complemented by Korean text listing BTS members\u2019 names and those of her friends.",
      "V thanked fans Tuesday for their patience in waiting for him and RM's return and teased the band's reunion. \"If you can just wait a little bit longer, we will return with a really amazing performance.\u201d",
      "The seven singers of the popular K-pop band plan to reunite as a group sometime in 2025 after they finish their service.",
      "Six of the group\u2019s seven members served in the army, while Suga is fulfilling his duty as a social service agent, an alternative form of military service. He will be discharged later this month.",
      "Jin, the oldest BTS member, was discharged in June 2024. J-Hope was discharged in October.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country musician Conner Smith fatally hit a pedestrian while driving his truck in Nashville over the weekend, and he currently faces no charges as an investigation continues, police said.",
      "Metro Nashville Police said Smith, 24, hit Dorothy Dobbins, 77, Sunday evening while she was crossing the road inside a marked crosswalk. Dobbins, a retired attorney, later died at a hospital. The Tennessee Bar Association posted on its website that Dobbins had been out walking her dog when she was hit.",
      "Police say Smith showed no signs of impairment. They believe the \u201cpreliminary contributing factor\u201d appears to be that Smith did not yield the right of way to the pedestrian.",
      "Smith\u2019s attorney, Worrick Robinson, said his client is cooperating with the investigation.",
      "\u201cHis heart goes out to Ms. Dobbins\u2019 family during this incredibly difficult time,\" Robinson said in a statement.",
      "Dobbins was a leader in the city\u2019s legal aid and family law communities, where she practiced for over 40 years, according to posts by the Bar Association and the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands. She played a \u201cfoundational role in opening Nashville\u2019s first domestic violence shelter,\u201d according to a Facebook post from the Legal Aid Society, and she wrote the state\u2019s first order of protection legislation.",

      "Lame arrived in the U.S. on April 30 and \u201coverstayed the terms of his visa,\u201d the ICE spokesperson said. The Associated Press sent a message seeking comment Tuesday to the email address listed on Lame\u2019s Instagram account. He has not publicly commented on his detainment.",
      "His detainment and voluntary departure from the U.S. comes amid President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating crackdown on immigration, including raids in Los Angeles that sparked days of protests against ICE, as the president tests the bounds of his executive authority.",
      "A voluntary departure \u2014 which was granted to Lame \u2014 allows those facing removal from the U.S. to avoid a deportation order on their immigration record, which could prevent them from being allowed back into the U.S. for up to a decade.",
      "The 25-year-old rose to international fame during the pandemic without ever saying a word in his videos, which would show him reacting to absurdly complicated \u201clife hacks.\" He has over 162 million followers on TikTok alone.",
      "The Senegal-born influencer moved to Italy when he was an infant with his working class parents and has Italian citizenship.",
      "His internet fame quickly evolved. He signed a multi-year partnership with designer brand Hugo Boss in 2022. In January, he was appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.",

      "The admission from Victoria Heuermann isn\u2019t made on camera but through a statement from producers near the end of \u201cThe Gilgo Beach Killer: House of Secrets,\u201d a three-part documentary on NBC\u2019s streaming service Peacock.",
      "\u201cA week before the series release, Victoria Heuermann told the producers that based on publicly available facts that have been presented and explained to her, she now believes her father is most likely the Gilgo Beach killer,\u201d reads a statement at the close of the final episode of the documentary.",
      "Bob Macedonio, an attorney for Heuermann\u2019s now ex-wife, Asa Ellerup, said in a statement after the documentary\u2019s release that \u201ctime will only tell\u201d whether his client will ever accept that her husband may have been a serial killer.",

      "In the documentary, Victoria Heuermann struggles to reconcile her childhood memories with the portrait of the killer described by authorities.",
      "She says her father was around the family \u201c90% of the time\u201d and was never violent toward any of them.",
      "At the same time, Victoria Heuermann acknowledged there were times when he stayed home while the family went on vacation and that she was around 10 to 13 years old when the killings happened. Prosecutors say Heuerman committed some of the killings in the basement while his family was out of town.",
      "\u201cWhether or not I believe my dad did it or not, I\u2019m on the fence about that,\u201d said the now 28-year-old. \u201cPart of me thinks he didn\u2019t do it, but at the same time, I don\u2019t know, he could have just totally had a double life.\u201d",
      "Ellerup, for her part, maintained she saw no \u201cabnormal behavior\u201d in their nearly three decades of marriage.",
      "She dismissed a computer file prosecutors claim is a \u201cblueprint\u201d of his crimes as \u201cabsurd.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say the document features a series of checklists for before, during and after a killing, such as a \u201cbody prep\u201d checklist that includes among other items a note to \u201cremove head and hands.\u201d",
      "Ellerup also shrugged off other evidence prosecutors have enumerated in court documents, including a vast collection of bondage and torture pornography found on electronic devices seized from their home, and hairs linked to Heuermann that were recovered on most of the victims\u2019 bodies.",
      "At the same time, she revealed that in July 2009, around the time one of his alleged victims went missing, Heuermann suddenly renovated a bathroom while she and their two children visited her family in Iceland. But she noted her former husband eventually joined the family for their final week of the trip.",
      "\u201cMy husband, he\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s my hero,\u201d Ellerup said. \u201cWhat I want to say to him is, \u2018I love you, no matter what.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ellerup divorced Heuermann after his arrest in 2023. But in the documentary, Victoria Heuermann says the separation was for financial reasons to protect the family\u2019s assets.",
      "Indeed, the filmmakers captured the family speaking to Heuermann by phone from jail, and the mother and daughter have been regularly attending court hearings with their attorney.",
      "The family, which also includes Ellerup\u2019s adult son from a prior marriage, is also planning to put up its notoriously ramshackle house in well-to-do Massapequa Park for sale as they look to move to a property they own in South Carolina.",
      "Ryan McCormick, an NBCUniversal spokesperson, declined to say how much family was compensated, though he said the payments could not go toward Heuermann or his defense funds.",

      "Before Celine Song was an Oscar-nominated filmmaker, she was a playwright in New York who needed day jobs to pay rent. That\u2019s how she found herself as a professional matchmaker.",
      "What may have begun as a purely transactional gig, a way for her to keep making her art in an expensive city, taught her more about people\u2019s wants and needs and the true contents of their hearts than she could have ever imagined.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to write something about it because there seemed to be a story in it that is massive and very epic in proportion,\u201d Song said. \u201cIt affects every human being on Earth.\"",
      "And while waiting for her breakout film \u201cPast Lives\u201d to debut, she did. That film is \u201cMaterialists,\u201d a modern-day New York love story starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans that\u2019s heading to theaters this weekend. Johnson is the matchmaker presented with two different types of men for herself \u2014 one a poor struggling actor and ex-boyfriend, the other a wealthy \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 and the internet has already been drawing battle lines. But, like \u201cPast Lives\u201d wasn\u2019t really about a love triangle, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is about something more than the question of which guy is the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.",
      "Song and Johnson spoke with The Associated Press about the film, falling in love and the modern marketplace of dating. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "SONG: We met up thinking that we were just going to get to know each other and be friends and I walked away from that conversation \u2014 this is just from my perspective \u2014 but I think I was still sitting there when I texted my producers and the studio being like, \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my Lucy.\u201d That\u2019s how casting works for me, it\u2019s always about falling in love. It\u2019s very connected to what we talk about in the film. Like, there\u2019s no mathematical anything. It just the feeling that you get talking to someone and you\u2019re like, oh I just know.",
      "JOHNSON: I knew you had this movie that you were about to start making. I was basically told it was too late. I was like, but I really want to meet her because she\u2019s so smart, and I\u2019ve seen interviews and obviously had seen \u201cPast Lives.\u201d I just wanted talk and get to know her as an artist and a person and so I went into this being like there\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be in this movie, but maybe she\u2019ll make another one. We just had such a good time talking, I didn\u2019t even know that I was someone she was thinking about. A few weeks later we spoke. It was very romantic.",
      "JOHNSON: She\u2019s sort of at the top of her game in her work and is very disconnected from her heart and focused on being a perfectionist and getting people to get married. On the surface, you see her as a very transactional person and not really invested in people\u2019s souls, but she actually is and really does want the best for them. She\u2019s also on her own journey of trying to figure out what it is she wants for herself in this life, and, essentially, do you fight for the thing that you think you want, or do you fight for that thing that you know you need? Is that right, Celine?",
      "SONG: That\u2019s so good.",
      "SONG: It was never going to be a conversation about which flavor of a person. It\u2019s actually so much more about this marketplace of dating that all of us live in if you\u2019re single, and also the marketplace that Dakota\u2019s character is navigating. She knows the math better than anyone else in the film. She\u2019s an excellent matchmaker.",
      "Pedro plays somebody who is probably, in straight dating, someone of the highest possible value. Chris\u2019 character, in the spectrum in the marketplace of values of dating, is someone who is of the lowest value possible. I find them to be such adorable characters, very worthy of an adoration.",
      "Lucy knows exactly where they fall in the in the stock market of men. It\u2019s actually about the way that the math around that is going to blow up.",
      "JOHNSON: Celine speaks so eloquently about the marketplace of dating and I glitch at those words because I\u2019m like, you can\u2019t explain love that way. But that\u2019s actually how people are. Marriage used to be a business deal. It was like, my father wants your cows and my mother needs your wheat and whatever. It was a trade-off. But now there\u2019s all these books about how we expect our partner to fulfill every single aspect of our needs. And the world being dominated by social media, people don\u2019t meet in real life anymore. They don\u2019t behave normally in public.",
      "People are in a very strange place in evolution, and I think the difference between these two characters and these two men, sure they are different ends of the spectrum in terms of like technical value, materialistic value. But also each of them have the opposite in terms of psycho-spiritual value and emotional value and what they can offer the other person in terms of soul evolution and growth.",
      "Perhaps because she works in this world of trying to understand people and what they want, she\u2019s forced to go more inward and really interrogate herself and say, what do I really want and what is actually important in this life? Is it how much money I have or is it how truly loved I am?",
      "SONG: To me, it\u2019s about this contradiction, right? It\u2019s this thing of how we talk about what we want in our partner, when we\u2019re asked to use language to describe it, and how we literally, spiritually fall in love. The gap between those two things is terrifyingly big. To me, that\u2019s where the mystery of the film is.",

Just a few years ago, their inclusion might've been unthinkable amid murky regulations and a lack of public awareness surrounding harm reduction.",
      "Advocates say drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, making them ideal locations for harm reduction activities. While more music festivals are allowing such activities, activists are pushing for expanded efforts as some festivals remain cautious.",
      "Founded by William Perry and Ingela Travers-Hayward in 2022, This Must Be The Place has since given away an estimated $4.5 million in naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, at festivals and smaller community events.",
      "In the very beginning, without a \u201cproof of concept,\u201d as Perry describes it, they had trouble partnering with festivals. Eventually, a few festivals in the Midwest agreed to let them table, which \u201cgot us in the door with Bonnaroo in 2022,\u201d says Perry, referring to the major U.S. festival operated by C3 Presents, one of the largest concert promoters on the planet. Now they have a presence at 35 major U.S. festivals \u2014 including Lollapalooza, Governors Ball and Besame Mucho \u2014 where they collaborate directly with C3 and their security personnel.",
      "The organization's growth overlaps with advancing federal regulations. According to Daliah Heller, vice president of overdose prevention initiatives at the global public health nonprofit Vital Strategies, naloxone distribution used to be determined by state regulations until 2023, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter nasal spray.",
      "\u201cWe no longer need the prescription laws to be amended to allow for the distribution of naloxone,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's like buying aspirin \u2014 it's over the counter.\u201d",
      "Last year, This Must Be the Place gave away 46,146 units of Narcan \u2014 a brand name for naloxone \u2014 through their national festival outreach.",
      "Emmett Beliveau, chief operating officer of C3 Presents, says working with This Must Be the Place was C3\u2019s first time implementing public-facing harm reduction strategies, in addition to the promoter's existing medical programs.",
      "Bringing the organization into C3\u2019s festivals was \u201cnot in response to anything that has happened at one of our festivals,\u201d he says, but rather because of the \u201cnumber of fatalities happening in our communities.\u201d",
      "Some activists believe attendees are most responsive to receiving harm reduction education from peers instead of authority figures. And so, for the last three years, a nonprofit dedicated to combating accidental drug overdoses among young adults, Team Awareness Combating Overdose, has distributed fentanyl test strips and Narcan at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.",
      "Former TACO CEO Kameran Mody says that music festivals are ideal locations for distribution and education because \u201cmusic and the use of drugs are synonymous with each other.\u201d",
      "TACO distributes through what Mody describes as \u201cguerrilla-style marketing.\u201d They enlist volunteers, train them on how to use naloxone, and ship Narcan and test strips to them to bring into the festival.",
      "They do not involve the festival organizers. Representatives for Coachella did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "In 2023, a TACO volunteer administered Narcan to an unresponsive Coachella attendee exhibiting signs of an overdose. The organization says the attendee regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cThat was one of our biggest successes,\u201d Mody says.",
      "In 2019, at Bonnaroo, a 27-year-old man was found dead at his campsite \u2014 right after harm reduction activists had picketed the Tennessee festival because it didn't allow drug testing. The toxicology report found ecstasy and fentanyl in his system.",
      "At the time, under state law, test strips were criminalized and classified as drug paraphernalia. That\u2019s changed: In 2022, Tennessee decriminalized fentanyl test strips. By the end of 2023, 44 other states and D.C. had done the same.",
      "But in some states, drug paraphernalia laws are written in a way that isn't completely transparent \u2014 there are test strips that are not fentanyl-specific, Heller points out \u2014 and criminalization and social stigmas endure.",
      "Some have found workarounds. \u201cEven in the states where the legalities were a bit unclear, instead of just coming in and hoping things worked out, we would reach out to the health department, and say \u2018We run this project, how do feel about it?\u2019\u201d says Perry. \u201cWe would end up with letters from the highest-ranking health official, either in the county or in the state, saying \u2018We approve of this.\u2019 That circumvented any roadblocks.\u201d",
      "Some festivals, though, might be hesitant to use test strips because \u201cit\u2019s tough for them to admit that drugs are being used,\u201d Mody says. Some festivals have even banned naloxone.",
      "While This Must Be The Place distributes fentanyl test strips at some Ohio events, C3 doesn't distribute test strips at its events and does not plan to. Beliveau doesn't believe fentanyl test strips are effective and expressed concern they could encourage drug use. Test strips, which can detect fentanyl in pills, powders or injectables, are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a low-cost means of helping prevent drug overdoses.",
      "At a three-day electronic music festival in Mexico City earlier this year, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing. The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), was spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users received detailed information on what they are, their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "Perry says they are aware of smaller festivals in the United States conducting drug checking, but \u201cthey do it in a very underground and whisper network way\u201d to avoid criminalization.",
      "What Perry says his organization would like to see at music festivals in the future would be harm reduction areas \u2014 sections where attendees who have taken drugs can be monitored, not to \u201cget them into trouble\u201d but to ensure safety.",
      "Heller says there are a number of groups working to destigmatize drugs, promote decriminalization, and promote drug checking.",
      "\u201cWe already have drug checking happening in cities,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to expand the settings where you would offer that to include music festivals. It's the same rationale. ... The issue is this idea of liability. You\u2019d have to create a law, essentially, that would protect the festival from liability.\u201d",

Five years later, she phoned with the news that \u201cShe's Come Undone\u201d was her latest book club pick. In 1998, Winfrey picked Lamb's \u201cI Know This Much Is True,\u201d his second novel.",

      "Midway up the Appalachian Trail, a little country store in Gardners, Pennsylvania, invites hikers to take on an additional challenge: eating a half-gallon of ice cream in one sitting",
      "GARDNERS, Pa. -- Sam Cooper had just trekked 7 miles (11 kilometers) through a rain-sodden stretch of the Appalachian Trail when he sat down outside a little country store in Pennsylvania to take on its ice cream challenge.",
      "Nearly 40 minutes and 2,500 calories later, the dairy farmer from Chapel Hill, Tennessee, was polishing off the final titanium sporkful of chocolate chip cookie dough on Tuesday and adding his name to the list of \u201cthru-hikers\u201d who have celebrated the trail's halfway point by downing a half-gallon of ice cream.",
      "By the end Cooper, 32, whose trail name is Pie Top, was calling the experience \u201cpure misery.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't think anybody should be doing this,\u201d Cooper said cheerfully. \u201cThis is not healthy at all.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge is thought to have begun more than four decades ago at the Pine Grove Furnace General Store in Gardners, a few miles north of the current true halfway point on the 2,197-mile (3,536-kilometer) trail. Thru-hikers, as they're known, are the fraction of the trail's 3 million annual visitors who attempt to walk its entire length in a single, continuous trip.",
      "As they slog their way north through Virginia and Maryland, the ice cream challenge is a regular topic of conversation among thru-hikers at shelters and campfires, said Stephan Berens, 49, a psychiatric nurse from Nuremberg, Germany.",
      "Berens, whose trail name is Speedy, polished off his black cherry and vanilla in about 25 minutes after completing 17 miles (27 kilometers) on the trail that day \u2014 and with seven (11 kilometers) more to go that afternoon.",
      "Trail experts say hikers can need up to 6,000 calories a day, a practical challenge when food needs to be carried up and down rocky terrain. The slender Berens figures he's lost about 20 pounds (9 kilograms) since starting April 8.",
      "\u201cI thought it would be worse, but it's OK,\u201d said Berens, smiling and patting his stomach after finishing the half-gallon. \u201cSuch a crazy idea.\u201d",
      "Zeke Meddock, trail name Petroglyph, didn't bother timing himself but finished his choice of a quart and a half carton of chocolate chip cookie dough and a pint of strawberry. The diesel mechanic from North Amarillo, Texas, began his hike on March 27, two months after finishing a stint in the U.S. Army.",
      "\u201cYou're basically walking away from life,\u201d said Meddock, 31. \u201cIt's the most free I've ever felt.\u201d",
      "So far this year, about 50 thru-hikers have finished the challenge, earning the honor of having their photos posted on a store bulletin board. In a notebook to record their thoughts, Chicken Louise wrote on May 24: \u201cLife choices?\u201d The next day, Seagull weighed in with, \u201cI feel bad,\" and Hyena issued a cry for help: \u201cIt was very fun for the first 15 minutes. Now, I (and my family) want to die.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge record, less than 4 minutes, was set two years ago by a man with the trail name Squirt. Two decades ago, the mark to beat was about 9 minutes.",
      "Thru-hikers who want to attempt the record may only allow the $12 worth of ice cream to start to melt in the sun for a few minutes. They must be timed by a store employee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s called the half-gallon challenge,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cVery appropriately named.\u201d",
      "Bruce Thomas, a 41-year-old disability support worker from Medicine Hat in Alberta, Canada, passed on the ice cream challenge, opting instead for a breakfast sandwich and another one for the road.",
      "\u201cIt's early morning and I'm pretty sure I cannot do it,\u201d said Thomas, trail name Not Lazy.",
      "Those who do finish in a single sitting are awarded a commemorative wooden spoon \u2014 and bragging rights for the rest of their hike. Some people get sick. Others wash down the ice cream with a hamburger.",
      "The ice cream challenge is one of several quirky traditions and places along the trail. There\u2019s a shelter in Virginia where hikers confess their sins in a logbook, a two-hole outhouse in Maine with a cribbage board between the seats and a free canoe ferry across the Kennebec River that\u2019s considered an official part of the trail. And at Harriman State Park in Tuxedo, New York, hikers encounter the renowned \u201cLemon Squeezer,\u201d a narrow rock formation.",
      "About one in three people who launch a thru hike take the roughly 5 million steps required to go the distance. They most often walk from south to north, starting in Springer Mountain, Georgia, and wrapping up 13 states later at Maine's Mount Katahdin.",
      "The trek typically takes six months but the current speed record is about 40 days, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Meddock said there's talk that a man on the trail behind him may be on pace to break it.",
      "There's also been a lot of discussion among hikers about the extensive damage along the trail in southern states from September's Hurricane Helene. But mostly they think and talk about walking.",
      "\u201cIt's always hard,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt's going to be hard. I never think about quitting. I only think about how I can do it.\u201d",

      "Here\u2019s the latest polling data on how Americans view federal funding:",

Nearly half, 45%, say food and nutrition assistance programs like food stamps, SNAP or EBT cards are underfunded, according to the poll. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults in each case say those programs are receiving \u201cabout the right amount\u201d of funding, indicating that most Americans likely do not want to see significant cuts to the two programs.",

      "Very few think Medicare, Social Security and education are getting \u201ctoo much\u201d funding. Only about 1 in 10 Republicans say this about either Medicare or Social Security. Roughly one-quarter of Republicans say too much is spent on education.",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers' personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.",
      "Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.",
      "As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.",
      "\u201cLast minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy \u2014 your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,\u201d one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.",
      "The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.",
      "The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country\u2019s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.",
      "\u201cThese powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,\u201d a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.",
      "CVS says on its website that it \u201cnegotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.\u201d",
      "The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.",
      "\u201cThe proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients\u2019 ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThey would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care \u2013 the consequences would be dire.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers \u201cmay shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo we\u2019re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,\u201d McMakin said.",

      "\u201cIt's in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve now taken that to send me political texts.\u201d",
      "CVS sent messages to \u201clarge numbers\" of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company's pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.",
      "Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information \u201cfor their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,\u201d Murrill told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s not why anybody gave them their phone number.\u201d",
      "Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.",
      "The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee \u2014 a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.",
      "\u201cWe believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,\u201d Thibault said in an email. \u201cOur communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state's legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.",
      "The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.",
      "Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS's lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn't be able to access their medications.",
      "\u201cCVS \u2026 you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,\u201d Landry said.",
      "The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.",
      "Landry said he plans to call a special session in hopes of passing similar legislation.",

      "A growing number of Black fathers with autistic children are looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience",
      "ATLANTA -- When Tyrone Green's youngest son was diagnosed with autism, his wife was immediately ready to get the 3-year-old the support he needed. But Green was stuck: He had questions about his son\u2019s future and an overwhelming feeling of loneliness \u2014 like no one, not his wife, not his friends, understood his experience.",
      "\u201c ... (M)y wife couldn\u2019t understand what I was going through as a Black father, all these hopes and dreams I had for my kid,\" said Green, who lives in Michigan. \u201cShe didn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d",
      "In 2021, he joined a Black fathers' support group and met a few other dads eager to discuss their unique challenges. They started their own podcast in 2023 called AutisHIM, a place where Black dads talk about the wins and setbacks of having autistic children.",
      "Green is among a growing number of Black fathers of autistic children looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience. These men say that their hope is not only to be considered more than sidekicks to mothers of the children, but also to help other Black dads accept autism diagnoses and not prolong getting kids the help that they need.",
      "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how people communicate, process information and interact with the world around them. Federal data shows that since 2020, Black children have had a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder than white children \u2014 a change experts credit mostly to better awareness of autism in underserved communities.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently announced plans to have the federal government do a broad study for the causes of autism, even though it\u2019s been looked at by researchers for decades. He has said autism is a \u201ctragedy\u201d that \u201cdestroys families\u201d and that some people with autism will never hold a job, pay taxes or go on dates.",
      "But many people with autism live successful, socially rich and independent lives, which makes a narrative like Kennedy's dangerous, said Michael Hannon, a counseling professor at Montclair State University who studies the social and emotional aspects of autism on Black fatherhood.",
      "It \u201ccan literally diminish hope for any father or father figure or family,\u201d Hannon said of Kennedy's framing of autism.",
      "But affinity groups for Black men who have kids with autism are a successful way to get the dads to engage with their emotions, Hannon said.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is convincing people to (talk openly and honestly), because the practice of doing that is rare, not just among Black men, but people in general,\u201d he said, adding that people might think it will reflect on their ability to parent.",
      "Evan Polk said a big part of navigating his 13-year-old daughter\u2019s diagnosis was learning to sit with emotions that weren't simply \u201chappy and mad.\u201d In the beginning, he was very protective.",
      "\u201cI became a helicopter dad,\u201d said Polk, who started AuSome Kicks, an art therapy nonprofit for autistic children near Philadelphia earlier this year. \u201cI didn\u2019t want nobody or nothing to harm her whatsoever. When I found out she was autistic, she\u2019d be outside with knee pads and elbow pads looking crazy.\u201d",
      "He said he later taught his family to be more patient with his daughter, as opposed to traditional parenting styles of being firm and hoping that she would fall in line.",
      "Dr. Berry Pierre said he initially was on the sidelines of his autistic daughter's support team as his wife, Maria Davis-Pierre, did the bulk of advocating.",
      "The Florida couple founded Autism in Black and for the first five years, he said the organization didn't specifically tailor messaging to Black dads.",
      "\u201cWhether it be in schools, the (individual education plan) meetings, the mothers were just there.\u201d Pierre said. \u201cBut as we started to kind of try to go deeper and figure out \u2018Alright, what\u2019s going on? Where are the guys?\u2019 we started to realize that a lot of them will be there.\u201d",
      "Many Black dads, Pierre found out, were equally involved as the moms, and Pierre wanted to get more of them talking publicly about autism.",
      "\u201cThe dads are there, but we know the general public doesn't realize that yet,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cSo we try to serve as this engine to shine a light on what's really happening. The dads are there, they're attentive. And even with this diagnosis, they're going even harder.\u201d",
      "Some dads, like Nicholas Love in North Carolina, said they first hesitated to openly share their journey of raising their kids with autism in fear that people may not understand.",
      "\u201cI was very guarded for a while in talking about my children both being on the spectrum,\u201d said Love, who is CEO of the marketing agency The Kulur Group. \u201cEven in how you take pictures that you upload on social media, being cognizant and thinking about, \u2019Well is this a picture that looks, dare I say, the perception of what normal looks like?'\"",
      "Now, he's an open book about them, is understanding when employees need a little extra time for urgent family needs and has advocated that men receive more paid leave so they will have time to be more involved with their kids.",
      "\u201cI got to a point where it\u2019s like, \u201cOK, this is my reality \u2026 I need to do my part in normalizing this,\" Love said.",
      "Green said that while his podcast and platforms like Autism in Black make it easier for Black fathers to share their stories of their kids' wins and losses, he'd like to see \u201cmore support groups out there, more podcasts, more conversations.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see a lot of Black women doing their thing and I highly appreciate that, but I think there definitely needs to be more conversations surrounding (Black fatherhood and autism) because, for myself, I\u2019m a Black man,\" Green said. \"I have a Black family, but this is never really the topic of discussion.\u201d",

      "Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias has asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department for allegedly sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Illinois secretary of state on Thursday asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department after learning that it violated state law by sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion.",
      "Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias asked the attorney general to review the matter. He also is creating an audit system to ensure police departments don't run afoul of a 2023 law banning the distribution of license-plate data to track women seeking abortions or to find undocumented immigrants.",
      "The incident underscores the fears that led to the law: In particular, that states which restricted abortion access after Roe v. Wade was overturned would use the technology to follow and possibly prosecute women seeking the procedure by crossing into Illinois, where it is readily available.",
      "\u201cLicense plate readers can serve as an important tool for law enforcement, but these cameras must be regulated so they aren\u2019t abused for surveillance, tracking the data of innocent people or criminalizing lawful behavior,\u201d the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "According to Giannoulias, police in Mount Prospect, 24 miles (39 kilometers) northwest of Chicago, shared license-plate data with the sheriff in Johnson County, Texas, who was looking for a woman whose family was worried because she had undergone a self-administered abortion.",
      "Giannoulias says Mount Prospect also shared data outside of Illinois on undocumented immigrants, in violation of the law. Between mid-January and April, there were 262 searches on immigration-related matters in Mount Prospect alone, he said.",
      "Telephone and email messages were left for Mount Prospect Police Chief Michael Eterno. Violations by Mount Prospect could result in loss of state funding, deputy Secretary of State Scott Burnham said.",
      "The incident was revealed by a website called 404 Media, which reported that the Texas sheriff sent a nationwide request for data from 83,000 cameras operated by the private company Flock Safety, including those in Mount Prospect.",
      "At Giannoulias\u2019 request, Flock Safety blocked access to 62 out-of-state agencies that have sought data related to abortion or immigration, Burnham said. The company also set up a program to flag the terms \u201cabortion\u201d and \u201cimmigration\u201d in requests for access and deny those requests.",
      "Police agencies will also be required to comply with audits by the secretary of state to mark trends or upticks in certain requests, Burnham said.",
      "The Flock Safety cameras take photos of passing license plates thousands of times a day. The technology, called Automatic License Plate Recognition, is helpful in tracking stolen vehicles or carjackings, missing persons and in other authorized cases.",
      "The technology allows police agencies to read thousands of license plates per minute from images captured by cameras along roadways.",
      "After Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, was overturned in 2022, Giannoulias was behind Illinois' first-in-the-nation law that requires other states wanting access to Illinois license-plate data to agree not to use it for that purpose or to track undocumented immigrants.",

      "The girl's family says that her Minnesota school district didn\u2019t do enough to make sure she has the accommodations she needs to learn, including failing to provide adequate instruction in the evening when her seizures are less frequent.",
      "But lower courts ruled against the family's discrimination claims in court, despite finding the school had fallen short. That\u2019s because courts in that part of the country require plaintiffs in lawsuits against schools to show officials used \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment,\u201d a higher legal standard than most disability discrimination claims.",
      "The family appealed to the Supreme Court. The district, Osseo Area Schools, said that lowering the legal standard could expose the country\u2019s understaffed public schools to more lawsuits if their efforts fall short, even if officials are working in good faith.",
      "The district also argued that all claims over accommodations for people with disabilities should be held to the same higher standard \u2014 a potentially major switch that would have been a \u201cfive-alarm fire\u201d for the disability rights community, the girl's lawyers said.",

      "Every month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.",
      "Whether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "Dr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.",
      "So far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.",
      "\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,\u201d said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "As more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.",
      "Erik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.",
      "\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,\u201d said Baptist, director of the group\u2019s Center for Life. \u201dAnd so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,\u201d said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. \u201cAt a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?\u201d",
      "Decades ago, the FDA approved the use of two prescription medicines \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 to terminate pregnancies.",

      "The Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, said that between April and June 2024 there were an average of 7,700 telehealth abortions performed each month in states that either ban abortion totally or after six weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.",
      "At some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.",
      "For instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.",

      "\u201cThis has been the safety net, post-Dobbs, of allowing people who don\u2019t have the ability to travel out of state to get abortion care,\u201d said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and abortion law expert.",
      "When dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.",
      "Twenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.",
      "Of those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF. They include California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state\u2019s shield law. (A county clerk also cited the shield law as he refused to file the civil judgment from Texas.)",
      "\u201cThese are not doctors providing health care. They are drug dealers,\u201d Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told state lawmakers as she promoted a bill that would expand who can sue and be sued in abortion medication cases. \u201cThey are violating our laws. They are sending illegal medications for purposes of procuring abortions that are illegal in our state.\u201d",
      "Julie Kay, the executive director of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, the nationwide organization co-founded by Carpenter, said providers won\u2019t be \u201cbullied and intimidated\u201d into ceasing operations.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday named eight new vaccine policy advisers to replace the panel that he abruptly dismissed earlier this week.",
      "They include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, and a professor of operations management.",
      "Kennedy's decision to \u201cretire\u201d the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors' groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy's desire to reassess \u2014 and possibly end \u2014 longstanding vaccination recommendations.",
      "On Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel \u2013 not anti-vaxxers \u2013 bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.\u201d",
      "The new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses, who has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he\u2019s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.",
      "He has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He\u2019s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.",
      "Other appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.",
      "Abram Wagner of the University of Michigan\u2019s school of public health, who investigates vaccination programs, said he\u2019s not satisfied with the composition of the committee.",
      "\u201cThe previous ACIP was made up of technical experts who have spent their lives studying vaccines,\u201d he said. Most people on the current list \u201cdon\u2019t have the technical capacity that we would expect out of people who would have to make really complicated decisions involving interpreting complicated scientific data.\u201d",
      "He said having Pebsworth on the board is \u201cincredibly problematic\u201d since she is involved in an organization that \u201cdistributes a lot of misinformation.\u201d",
      "Kennedy made the announcement in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC directors almost always approve those recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The CDC\u2019s final recommendations are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "The other appointees are:",
      "\u2014Dr. James Hibbeln, who formerly headed a National Institutes of Health group focused on nutritional neurosciences and who studies how nutrition affects the brain, including the potential benefits of seafood consumption during pregnancy.",
      "\u2014Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies business issues related to supply chain, logistics, pricing optimization and health and health care management. In a 2023 video pinned to an X profile under his name, Levi called for the end of the COVID-19 vaccination program, claiming the vaccines were ineffective and dangerous despite evidence they saved millions of lives.",
      "\u2014Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician from Los Angeles.",
      "\u2014Dr. Michael Ross, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist.",
      "Of the eight named by Kennedy, perhaps the most experienced in vaccine policy is Meissner, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who has previously served as a member of both ACIP and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory panel.",
      "During his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.",
      "Ultimately, the FDA disregarded the panel\u2019s recommendation and OK\u2019d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.",
      "In addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccination schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "ACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one \u201cconsumer representative\u201d who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.",
      "Most of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.",
      "\u201cIf you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you\u2019re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "The U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.",
      "Kennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.",
      "In late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.",
      "On Monday, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, but a recent federal notice said votes are expected on vaccinations against flu, COVID-19, HPV, RSV and meningococcal bacteria.",

The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents would need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "A top aide to Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Calley Means has built a following within the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement by railing against the failings of the U.S. health system, often pinning the blame on one issue: corruption.",
      "Means, a top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was hired as a White House adviser in March. He has used that perch to attack the nation\u2019s leading physician groups, federal agencies and government scientists, claiming they only protect their own interests in the nation\u2019s $4.9 trillion-a-year industry.",
      "In recent interviews, speeches and podcasts he has called the American Medical Association \u201ca pharma lobbying group,\u201d labeled the Food and Drug Administration \u201ca sock puppet of industry,\" and said federal health scientists have \u201coverseen a record of utter failure.\u201d",
      "Means, however, has his own financial stake in the sprawling health system. He\u2019s the co-founder of an online platform, Truemed, that offers dietary supplements, herbal remedies and other wellness products. Some of the vendors featured on Truemed\u2019s website are supporters of Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, which downplays the benefits of prescription drugs, vaccines and other rigorously tested medical products.",
      "Kennedy has pledged to run the Department of Health and Human Services with \u201cradical transparency,\u201d but Means has never had to publicly disclose his own financial details or where exactly they intersect with the policies he's advancing.",
      "\u201cIt reeks of hypocrisy,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a health researcher at Yale University. \u201cIn effect, he is representing another industry that is touting nonregulated products and using his platform within the government to financially benefit himself.\u201d",
      "In a written statement, Means said his government work has not dealt with matters affecting Truemed and has focused on issues like reforming nutrition programs and pressuring companies to phase out food dyes.",
      "\u201cPursuing these large-scale MAHA goals to make America healthy has been the sole focus in my government work,\u201d Means said.",
      "Truemed helps users take tax-free money out of their health savings accounts, or HSAs, to spend on things that wouldn\u2019t normally qualify as medical expenses, such as exercise equipment, meal delivery services and homeopathic remedies \u2014 mixtures of plants and minerals based on a centuries-old theory of medicine that's not supported by modern science.",
      "The business model caught the attention of the IRS last year, which issued an alert: \u201cBeware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care.\u201d",
      "Truemed co-founder and CEO, Justin Mares, said in a statement the company is \u201cin full alignment\u201d with IRS guidelines.",
      "\u201cTruemed enables patients to work with providers to use medical funds for root cause interventions like exercise and vitamin D to reverse disease under current law,\u201d Mares said.",
      "The full extent of Means\u2019 potential conflicts \u2014 including his personal investments\u2014 are unclear because of his status as a special government employee.",
      "Unlike presidential appointees and other senior officials, special government employees are temporary staffers who do not have to leave companies or sell investments that could be impacted by their work. Also, their financial disclosure forms are shielded from public release.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush now at the University of Minnesota. Painter and other experts have raised alarms over a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails.",
      "Still, part-time government employees are subject to the same law that bars all federal staffers from working on issues that could directly benefit their finances. When such cases arise, they must recuse themselves or risk criminal penalties.",
      "Means regularly opines on matters before HHS, including rethinking the use of drugs for depression, weight loss, diabetes and other conditions. Recently he's been promoting a new government report that calls for scaling back prescription medications in favor of exercise, dietary changes and other alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf we rely less on our medical system, less on drugs, it necessitates the spiritual, cultural conversation about what we\u2019re doing to our children\u2019s bodies,\u201d Means said in a recent podcast appearance.",
      "Experts note that government ethics rules are intended to both prevent financial conflict violations, but also the appearance of such conflicts that might undermine public trust in government.",
      "\u201cIf I were running the ethics office over at HHS, I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want anybody going around giving interviews and speeches about government matters that could have an effect on their own financial interests,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Means\u2019 rapid rise reflects the seeming contradictions within the MAHA movement itself, which urges followers to distrust both big corporations and the government agencies which regulate them.",
      "Means rails against big pharma and food conglomerates, two industries that he says he spent years working for as a consultant in Washington.",
      "Means has no medical training. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he previously ran a bridal gown startup with his wife. On Wednesday, he's scheduled to be the keynote speaker at FDA's annual science forum, according to a copy of the program shared with The Associated Press.",
      "He traces his passion for health care reform to the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer in 2021. Shortly thereafter, Means and his sister, Dr. Casey Means, took psychedelics together and had \u201ca mind-blowing, life-changing experience,\u201d which led them to co-author a wellness book, launch separate health startups and begin appearing on podcasts.",
      "Casey Means was recently nominated to be surgeon general and has faced scrutiny over her qualifications, including an unfinished medical residency.",
      "Asked about her nomination, President Donald Trump said: \u201cBobby thought she was fantastic,\u201d adding that he did not know her.",
      "Meanwhile, her brother has stepped up his rhetoric for the MAHA agenda, recently declaring that Kennedy has \u201ca spiritual mandate to reform our broken system.\"",
      "While promoting the administration\u2019s accomplishments, Means does not shy away from plugging his own brand or those of his business partners.",
      "When asked to offer health advice to listeners of a sports podcast, Outkick The Show, in April, Means said: \u201cRead our book, \u2018Good Energy.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also recommended blood tests sold by Function Health, which provides subscription-based testing for $500 annually. The company was cofounded by Dr. Mark Hyman, a friend of Kennedy and an investor in Truemed, which also offers Hyman's supplements through its platform. Casey Means is also an investor in Hyman's company.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, most likely you have some kind of nutrient deficiency, some kind of biomarker that you can actually then target with your diet and your supplements,\u201d Calley Means said.",
      "Like dietary supplements, the marketing claims on laboratory tests sold by Hyman are not approved by the FDA. The agency has warned for years about the accuracy of such tests and tried to start regulating them under President Joe Biden.",
      "Experts say MAHA entrepreneurs like Hyman are following a playbook common to the wellness industry: Identify a health concern, market a test to diagnose it and then sell supplements or other remedies to treat it.",
      "\u201cIt ends up favoring these products and services that rest on flimsy grounds, at the expense of products that have actually survived a rigorous FDA approval process,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Many of the items sold via Truemed, including sweat tents, cold plunge tanks and light therapy lamps, wouldn\u2019t typically qualify as medical expenses under rules for HSAs, tax-free accounts created by Congress to manage medical costs.",
      "The IRS generally states that HSA purchases must help diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease.",
      "Truemed allows users to request a \u201cletter of medical necessity\u201d from a doctor, stating that the product in question could have medical value for them. Like other telehealth services, there\u2019s usually no real-time communication with the patient. The physician reviews a \u201csimple survey solution,\u201d filled out by the Truemed user, according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Industry representatives say customers should be careful.",
      "\u201cYou need to be prepared to defend your spending habits under audit,\u201d said Kevin McKechnie, head of the American Bankers Association\u2019s HSA council. \u201cCompanies are popping up suggesting they can help you manage that process and maybe they can \u2014 so the debate continues.\u201d",
      "Americans have an estimated $147 billion in HSA accounts, a potential windfall for companies like Truemed that collects fees for transactions made using their platforms.",
      "Means sees an even bigger opportunity \u2014 routing federal funds out of government programs and into more HSAs.",
      "\u201cThe point of our company is to steer medical dollars into flexible spending,\u201d Means told fitness celebrity Jillian Michaels, on her podcast last year. \u201cI want to get that $4.5 trillion of Medicare, Medicaid, everything into a flexible account.\u201d",
      "Means\u2019 pitch for expanding HSAs echoes two decades of Republican talking points on the accounts, which were created in 2003 to encourage Americans in high-deductible plans to be judicious with their health dollars.",
      "But HSAs have not brought down spending, economists say. They are disproportionately used by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.",
      "Americans who earn more than $1 million annually are the group most likely to make regular HSA contributions, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half Americans with HSAs have balances less than $500.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d would further expand HSA purchases, making gym memberships and other fitness expenses eligible for tax-free spending. That provision alone is expected to cost the government $10 billion in revenue.",
      "\u201cThese are really just tax breaks in the guise of health policy that overwhelmingly benefit people with high incomes,\u201d said Gideon Lukens, a former White House budget official during the Obama and Trump administrations, now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Expanding HSA eligibility was listed as a goal for a coalition of MAHA entrepreneurs and Truemed partners, founded by Means, which lobbied Congress last year, according to the group's website.",
      "Means said in a statement that the group focused only on broad topics like \u201chealth care incentives and patient choice \u2014 but did not lobby for specific bills.\u201d",
      "In total, the HSA expansions in Trump's bill are projected to cost the federal government $180 billion over the next 10 years. As HSAs expand to include more disparate products and services, Lukens says the U.S. government will have fewer dollars to expand medical coverage through programs like Medicaid.",
      "\u201cWe have a limited amount of federal resources and the question is whether we want to spend that on health and wellness products that may or may not be helpful for wealthy people,\u201d Lukens said.",

A spokesperson for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would review the legislation.",
      "The New York Senate gave final approval to the bill Monday night after hours of debate during which supporters said it would let terminally ill people die on their own terms.",

The CDC said in May that more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the U.S. compared to May of last year, and most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\"",
      "Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates \u2014 above 95% \u2014 due to \u201cherd immunity.\u201d But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",

      "The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency says there is a possibility of both radiological and chemical contamination within Iran\u2019s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz",
      "VIENNA -- The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Monday that there is a possibility of both radiological and chemical contamination within Iran\u2019s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz following Israeli strikes, although radiation levels outside the complex are presently normal.",
      "IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said that the radiation poses a significant danger if uranium is inhaled or ingested. He added that the risk can be effectively managed with appropriate protective measures, such as using respiratory protection devices while inside the facilities.",
      "\u201cThe level of radioactivity outside the Natanz site has remained unchanged and at normal levels, indicating no external radiological impact to the population or the environment from this event,\u201d Grossi said.",
      "Grossi was addressing an urgent session of the U.N. nuclear watchdog board in Vienna that was convened at the request of Russia to discuss Israeli attacks against Iranian nuclear facilities. He said there apparently was no additional damage at Natanz and the Isfahan nuclear research site since Saturday.",
      "He said that the main concern inside the Natanz facility is the chemical toxicity of a gas called uranium hexafluoride, which is the result of fluorine mixed with the uranium during enrichment. It is extremely volatile, will quickly corrode, can burn the skin and is especially deadly if inhaled, experts say.",
      "\u201cAmid theses challenging and complex circumstances, it is crucial that the IAEA receives timely and regular technical information about the facilities and their respective sites,\u201d Grossi said.",
      "Without information, the U.N. nuclear watchdog \u201ccannot accurately assess the radiological conditions and potential impacts on the population and the environment and cannot provide the necessary assistance.\u201d",
      "Grossi said that U.N. inspectors will remain present in Iran and inspect the nuclear facilities \u201cas soon as safety conditions allow.\u201d",
      "He warned that \u201cmilitary escalation threatens lives, increases the chance of a radiological release with serious consequences for people and the environment and delays indispensable work towards a diplomatic solution for the long-term assurance that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show extensive damage at Iran\u2019s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz. The images captured Saturday by Planet Labs PBC show multiple buildings damaged or destroyed. The structures hit include buildings identified by experts as supplying power to the facility.",
      "Grossi told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground did not appear to be hit, but the loss of power could have damaged infrastructure there, he said.",
      "Israel also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The IAEA said four critical buildings were damaged, including an uranium-conversion facility, but there was no sign of increased radiation at Natanz or Isfahan.",
      "Grossi on Monday also told the IAEA board of governors that no damage has been seen at the site of the Fordo enrichment site, which is buried under a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft batteries. Fordo appears designed to withstand airstrikes.",
      "Grossi also said that the Bushehr nuclear power plant, Iran\u2019s only commercial nuclear power plant, has not been targeted nor affected by the recent attacks and neither has the Tehran Research Reactor.",
      "Any country on the 35-member board of the IAEA can call a meeting under its rules. The IAEA board last week found Iran in non-compliance with its nuclear obligations for the first time in 20 year.",

      "The Frankfurt Higher Regional Court also established the particular gravity of the guilt, which in practice virtually rules out early release after 15 years \u2014 as is often the case in Germany when people are sentenced to life imprisonment. The 40-year-old Syrian, who was identified as Alaa M. in line with German privacy rules, was placed in preventive detention, German news agency dpa reported.",
      "In his verdict, presiding judge Christoph Koller described the actions of the accused in the military hospital in the Syrian city of Homs in the early stages of the civil war that began in 2011. He said the doctor had sadistic tendencies and acted them out during the torture.",
      "\u201cAbove all, the accused enjoyed harming people that seemed inferior and low-value to him,\u201d Koller said, according to dpa.",
      "During the trial, which lasted almost three and a half years, victims had described the most severe abuse, including beatings, kicks and the setting of wounds and body parts on fire, dpa reported.",
      "Koller emphasized that without the willingness and courage of witnesses to share the details of their suffering the facts of the case could not have been clarified.",
      "M. had lived in Germany for ten years and had worked as an orthopedic surgeon in several clinics, most recently in Bad Wildungen in northern Hesse. In summer 2020, he was arrested after some of his victims had recognized him from a TV documentary about Homs, dpa reported.",
      "The doctor supposedly tortured prisoners who were considered part of the opposition to former Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. The trial against him began in January 2022.",
      "Alaa M. described himself as not guilty during the trial, alleging that he was the victim of a conspiracy, dpa wrote. The verdict is not yet final.",

      "Cambodian and Thai authorities have engaged in saber-rattling since last week, and continue to implement or threaten measures short of armed force, keeping tensions high. Thailand has added restrictions at border crossings, and Cambodia has banned Thai movies and TV shows and implemented a boycott of the neighboring country\u2019s international internet links.",
      "Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen, the former prime minister, said in a televised speech Monday that the ban on Thai fruits and vegetables would take effect if Thailand doesn\u2019t lift the border restrictions by Tuesday.",
      "Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra later said Thailand decided to impose the border restrictions out of safety concerns for the citizens of both countries due to the heavier presence of armed forces along the areas. She also said any \u201cunprofessional communication\u201d that was conveyed outside a bilateral mechanism would only hurt the interests of both sides.",
      "Officials of the two countries met over the weekend in Cambodia\u2019s capital, Phnom Penh, on the conflicting territorial claims that led to last month\u2019s deadly confrontation.

      "MOKOPANE, South Africa -- The white crosses are staked in the ground on an otherwise barren hillside on the edge of a farm, each one standing as a reminder of a terrible story of a person being killed.",
      "But the crosses, nearly 3,000 of them, do not tell the full story of South Africa's farm killings.",
      "The Witkruis Monument \u2014 which means White Cross Monument in the language spoken by South Africa's white Afrikaner minority \u2014 is a memorial only to white people who were killed on farms over the last three decades. It's a visceral snapshot seized on by some South Africans to drive a discredited narrative that white farmers in the majority Black country are being targeted in a widespread, race-based system of persecution.",
      "The false narrative has also been spread by conservative commentators in the United States and elsewhere \u2014 and amplified by South African-born Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump. Last month, Trump escalated the rhetoric, using the term \u201cgenocide\u201d to describe violence against white farmers.",
      "The South African government and experts who have studied farm killings have publicly denounced the misinformation spread by Trump and others. Even the caretaker of Witkruis says the monument \u2014 which makes no reference to the hundreds of Black South African farmers and farmworkers who have been killed \u2014 does not tell the complete story.",
      "The killings of farmers and farmworkers, regardless of race, are a tiny percentage of the country's high level of crime, and they typically occur during armed robberies, according to available statistics and two studies carried out over the last 25 years.",
      "Yet because wealthier white people own 72% of South Africa's privately owned farms, according to census data, they are disproportionately affected by these often brutal crimes. Black people own just 4% of the country\u2019s privately owned farmland, and the rest is owned by people who are mixed race or of Indian heritage.",
      "Misinformation about farm killings has been fueled by right-wing political groups in South Africa and others outside the country, said Gareth Newman, a crime expert at the Institute for Security Studies think tank in Pretoria.",
      "Some of the fringe South African groups, which hold no official power, boycotted the country\u2019s first democratic elections in 1994, when South Africa's apartheid system of white minority rule officially ended. They have espoused a debunked theory of persecution \u2014 in a country where whites make up about 7% of the population \u2014 ever since.",
      "\u201cThey held on to these beliefs as a way of maintaining social cohesion in their groups, making sure that they can obtain funding and support,\" Newman said. \"And they were getting support from right-wing groups abroad because it fit their narrative.\"",
      "The Witkruis Monument was started in 2004 but recognizes victims going back to 1994.",
      "Each year, more crosses are planted to memorialize white farmers and their family members who were killed, organizers say. Recently, they've planted around 50 crosses a year.",
      "Kobus de Lange, a local Afrikaner farmer, has taken on the role of caretaker of Witkruis. He gave The Associated Press access to see the memorial, bringing along his wife and children to help tidy up the monument in the country's north, near the town of Mokopane.",
      "De Lange expressed the fear and frustration of a white farming community that feels authorities have not done enough to protect them. One of his sons wore a T-shirt with the slogan \u201cenough is enough\u201d \u2014 written in their Afrikaans language \u2014 in reference to the killings.",
      "But de Lange acknowledged that the memorial does not capture the full scope of farm killings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s across the board, there are Black farmers who are also attacked,\u201d de Lange said. He said in some farm attacks, Black farmworkers are tortured by criminals for information on how to break into the main farmhouse.",
      "The Witkruis Monument would be willing to put up crosses to Black farmers and farmworkers who have been killed, but their relatives haven't requested it, he said.",
      "The monument includes memorabilia bearing the flags of conservative Afrikaner movements, symbols that are generally frowned upon because Afrikaners were at the heart of the apartheid government.",
      "From April 2023 through March 2024, there were 49 farm killings recorded by AfriForum, a white Afrikaner lobby group. That's about 0.2% of overall murders tallied by the government over the same period. The group recorded 296 farm robberies in that timeframe, or about 0.7% of all robberies.",
      "AfriForum's numbers don't include killings of Black farmers and workers, and the country\u2019s official crime statistics are not broken down by race.",
      "Black people make up more than 80% of South Africa\u2019s population of 62 million, and most victims of violent crime across South Africa are Black. But there is no public relations campaign to raise awareness about the killing of Black farmers.",
      "Across racial lines, most public outcry about crime in South Africa is over the high rates of rape and murder of women and children, which mostly takes place in cities and townships.",
      "To tamp down misinformation, South African police last month took the unprecedented step of providing a racial breakdown of farm killings during the first three months of the year. Between January and March, there were six murders on farms, down from 12 during the same period last year. One of the victims was white, the rest were Black.",
      "\u201cWhat Donald Trump is saying about whites being targeted does not exist,\" said MmaNtuli Buthelezi, who lives on a farm in Normandien, a rural area in KwaZulu-Natal province.",
      "Black farmworkers also feel vulnerable, Buthelezi said. \"We don\u2019t even have small firearms. Our weapons are just a spear and a shield, and sticks we get from the woods.\u201d",
      "Nomandien is an area where the farming community planted white crosses to raise awareness about farm killings in 2020. During a White House visit last month by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Trump showed a video in which he incorrectly referred to the location as a \u201cburial site\u201d of slain white farmers.",
      "Also, and without evidence, Trump has accused South Africa's Black-led government of \u201cfueling\u201d what he said was racially motivated violence against whites. In February, Trump issued an executive order punishing the country by banning all U.S. aid and assistance to South Africa.",
      "The Trump administration has cited a chant used by a minority Black-led political party in South Africa that has the lyrics \u201cshoot the farmer\u201d as contributing to what it claims is the racially motivated killings of white farmers. Violent crimes against farmers were a problem for years before the apartheid-era chant was revived.",
      "The South African government investigated farm killings in 2003. It interviewed dozens of police detectives and other experts and concluded that robbery was the most common motive for violent crimes, including murders, that occurred on farms. A study by the South African Human Rights Commission in 2015 reached a similar conclusion.",
      "\u201cIt is criminal individuals and groups that are targeting them because they are considered vulnerable,\u201d said Newham, who has researched the subject for more than 15 years. \u201cThey have things like cars, guns and laptops.\u201d",
      "In some cases, perpetrators are former laborers who return to attack, kill and rob farm owners to settle disputes over money. In others, disgruntled former employees had returned simply for revenge, according to historical records of the National Prosecuting Authority.",

      "When U.S. President Donald Trump last came to Canada for a Group of Seven summit, the enduring image was of him seated with his arms folded defiantly as then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel stared daggers at him",
      "KANANASKIS, Alberta -- When U.S. President Donald Trump last came to Canada for a Group of Seven summit, the enduring image was of him seated with his arms folded defiantly as then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel stared daggers at him.",
      "If there is a shared mission at this year\u2019s G7 summit, which begins Monday in Canada\u2019s Rocky Mountains, it is a desire to minimize any fireworks at a moment of combustible tensions.",
      "The 2018 summit ended with Trump assailing his Canadian hosts on social media as he departed on Air Force One, saying he had instructed the U.S. officials who remained in Quebec to oppose the G7 joint statement endorsed by the leaders of Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and, of course, Canada.",
      "\u201cI have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!\u201d Trump posted on the site then known as Twitter.",
      "This time, Trump already has hit several dozen nations with severe tariffs that risk a global economic slowdown. There is little progress on settling the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and now a new and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program.",
      "Add to all of that the problems of climate change, immigration, drug trafficking, new technologies such as artificial intelligence and China's continued manufacturing superiority and chokehold on key supply chains.",
      "Asked if he planned to announce any trade agreements at the G7 as he left the White House on Sunday, Trump said: \u201cWe have our trade deals. All we have to do is send a letter, \u2018This is what you\u2019re going to have to pay.' But I think we'll have a few, few new trade deals.\"",
      "At stake might be the survival of the G7 itself at a time when the Trump administration has sent mixed signals about whether the president will attend the November Group of 20 summit in South Africa.",
      "What Trump opposed at the 2018 summit in Quebec wasn't just tariffs, but a focus on having alliances with a shared set of standards seeking to shape policies.",
      "\u201cThe big dispute in Quebec were the references to the rules-based international order and that\u2019s where that famous photo comes from,\u201d said Peter Boehm, Canada\u2019s counselor at the 2018 G7 summit in Quebec and a veteran of six G7 summits. \u201cI think it gave everyone the idea that G7s were maybe not business as usual.\u201d",
      "The German, U.K., Japanese and Italian governments have each signaled a belief that a friendly relationship with Trump this year can reduce the likelihood of outbursts.",
      "\u201cWell, I have got a good relationship with President Trump, and that\u2019s important,\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday as he flew to Canada.",
      "There is no plan for a joint statement this year from the G7, a sign that the Trump administration sees no need to build a shared consensus with fellow democracies if it views such a statement as contrary to its goals of new tariffs, more fossil fuel production and a Europe that is less dependent on the U.S. military.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration almost certainly believes that no deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d said Caitlin Welsh, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank who was part of Trump's team for the G7 in Trump's first term.",
      "The White House has stayed decidedly mum about its goals for the G7, which originated as a 1973 finance ministers' meeting to address the oil crisis and steadily evolved into a yearly summit that is meant to foster personal relationships among world leaders and address global problems.",
      "The G7 even briefly expanded to the G8 with Russia as a member, only for Russia to be expelled in 2014 after annexing Crimea and taking a foothold in Ukraine that preceded its aggressive 2022 invasion of that nation.",
      "Trump will have at least three scheduled bilateral meetings during the summit with other world leaders while in Canada, staring on Monday morning with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The U.S. president is also expected to have bilateral meetings with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to an administration official.",
      "The U.S. president has imposed 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos, all of which have disproportionately hit Japan. Trump is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period set by him would expire.",
      "The United Kingdom reached a trade framework with the U.S. that included quotas to protect against some tariffs, but the 10% baseline would remain as the Trump administration is banking on tariff revenues to help cover the cost of its income tax cuts.",
      "Canada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, through some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump's first term.",
      "The Trump administration has insisted that its broad tariffs will produce trade agreements that box out China, though it's unclear how antagonizing trade partners would make them want to strengthen their reliance on the U.S. Carney, the Canadian leader, has been outspoken in saying his country can no longer look to the U.S. as an enduring friend.",
      "That might leave Trump with the awkward task of wanting to keep his tariffs in place while also trying to convince other countries that they're better off siding with the U.S. than China.",
      "\u201cTrump will try to coordinate the group against China\u2019s economic coercion,\u201d Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, wrote in an analysis. \u201cBut the rest of the leaders may turn back to Trump and say that this kind of coordination, which is at the heart of why the G7 works, would be easier if he weren\u2019t imposing tariffs on his allies.\u201d",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Iran fired a new wave of missile attacks on Israel early Monday, triggering air raid sirens across the country as emergency services reported at least five killed and dozens more wounded in the fourth day of open warfare between the regional foes that showed no sign of slowing.",
      "One missile fell near the American consulate in Tel Aviv, and its concussion caused minor damage, U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee said on X. There were no injuries to American personnel.",
      "Iran announced it had launched some 100 missiles and vowed further retaliation for Israel's sweeping attacks on its military and nuclear infrastructure, which have killed at least 224 people in the country since last Friday.",
      "The attacks raised Israel\u2019s total death toll to at least 18, and in response the Israeli military said fighter jets had struck 10 command centers in Tehran belonging to Iran's Quds Force, an elite arm of its Revolutionary Guard that conducts military and intelligence operations outside Iran.",
      "Powerful explosions, likely from Israel\u2019s defense systems intercepting Iranian missiles, rocked Tel Aviv shortly before dawn on Monday, sending plumes of black smoke into the sky over the coastal city.",

      "The Israeli Magen David Adom emergency service reported that two women and two men \u2014 all in their 70s \u2014 and one other person were killed in the wave of missile attacks that struck four sites in central Israel.",
      "\u201cWe clearly see that our civilians are being targeted,\u201d said Israeli police spokesman Dean Elsdunne outside the bombed-out building in Petah Tikva. \u201cAnd this is just one scene. We have other sites like this near the coast, in the south.\u201d",
      "Petah Tikva resident Yoram Suki rushed with his family to a shelter after hearing an air raid alert, and emerged after it was over to find his apartment destroyed.",
      "\u201cThank God we were OK,\u201d the 60-year-old said.",
      "Despite losing his home, he urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to keep up the attacks on Iran.",
      "\u201cIt's totally worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is for the sake of our children and grandchildren.\u201d",
      "In addition to those killed, the MDA said paramedics had evacuated another 87 wounded people to hospitals, including a 30-year-old woman in serious condition, while rescuers were still searching for residents trapped beneath the rubble of their homes.",
      "\u201cWhen we arrived at the scene of the rocket strike, we saw massive destruction,\u201d said Dr. Gal Rosen, a paramedic with MDA who said he had rescued a 4-day-old baby as fires blazed from the building.",
      "During an earlier barrage of Iranian missiles on central Israel on Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that Iran will stop its strikes if Israel does the same.",
      "But after a day of intensive Israeli aerial attacks that extended targets beyond military installations to hit oil refineries and government buildings, the Revolutionary Guard struck a hard line on Monday, vowing that further rounds of strikes would be \u201cmore forceful, severe, precise and destructive than previous ones.\"",
      "Health authorities also reported that 1,277 were wounded in Iran, without distinguishing between military officials and civilians.",
      "Rights groups, like the Washington-based Iranian advocacy group called Human Rights Activists, have suggested that the Iranian government\u2019s death toll is a significant undercount. Human Rights Activists says it has documented more than 400 people killed, among them 197 civilians.",
      "Israel argues that its assault on Iran's top military leaders, uranium enrichment sites and nuclear scientists was necessary to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.",
      "Iran has always insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, and the U.S. and others have assessed that Tehran has not pursued a nuclear weapon since 2003.",
      "But Iran has enriched ever-larger stockpiles of uranium to near weapons-grade levels in recent years and was believed to have the capacity to develop multiple weapons within months if it chose to do so.",

      "President Donald Trump would have unique influence over the operations of U.S. Steel under the terms of the investment being made by Nippon Steel",
      "CALGARY, Alberta -- President Donald Trump would have unique influence over the operations of U.S. Steel under the terms of what the White House calls an \u201cinvestment\u201d being made by Japan-based Nippon Steel in the iconic American steelmaker.",
      "Administration officials over the past few days provided additional insight into the \u201cgolden share\u201d arrangement that the federal government made as a condition for supporting the deal.",
      "The Pittsburgh-based steel maker and Nippon Steel plan $11 billion in new investments by 2028 after indicating that they plan to move forward with the deal under the terms of a national security agreement that has the White House's approval.",
      "The White House has described the deal as a \u201cpartnership\u201d and an \u201cinvestment\u201d by Nippon Steel in U.S. Steel, although Nippon Steel has never backed off its stated intention of buying and controlling U.S. Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary in a nearly $15 billion offer it originally made in late 2023.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick posted on social media on Saturday how the \u201cgolden share\u201d to be held by the president would operate, revealing that the White House is willing to insert itself aggressively into a private company's affairs even as it has simultaneously pledged to strip away government regulations so businesses can expand.",
      "Under the government's terms, it would be impossible without Trump's consent to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters from Pittsburgh, change the name of the company, \u201ctransfer production or jobs outside the United States,\u201d shutter factories, or reincorporate the business overseas, among other powers held by the president.",
      "Lutnick also said it would require presidential approval to reduce or delay $14 billion in planned investments.",
      "\u201cThe Golden Share held by the United States in U.S. Steel has powerful terms that directly benefit and protect America, Pennsylvania, the great steelworkers of U.S. Steel, and U.S. manufacturers that will have massively expanded access to domestically produced steel,\u201d Lutnick posted on X.",
      "That $14 billion figure is higher than what the companies disclosed on Friday when Trump created a pathway for the investment with an executive order based on the terms of the national security agreement being accepted.",
      "Lawmakers from Pennsylvania say the higher figure includes the cost of an electric arc furnace \u2014 a more modern steel mill that melts down scrap \u2014 that Nippon Steel wants to build in the U.S., bringing the value of the deal to at least $28 billion.",
      "The president has the authority to name one of the corporate board\u2019s independent three directors and veto power over the other two choices, according to a person familiar with the terms of the agreement who insisted on anonymity to discuss them. The details of the board structure were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Details of the agreement emerged as Trump was traveling to Alberta in Canada for the Group of Seven summit.",
      "Still, the full terms remain somewhat unclear. The companies have not made public the full terms of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel or the national security agreement with the federal government.",
      "On Sunday, the United Steelworkers, the labor union representing U.S. Steel employees, posted a letter raising questions about the deal forged by Trump, who during his run for the presidency had pledged to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel.",
      "The union said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Trump \u201chas reversed course\u201d and raised basic questions about the ownership structure of U.S. Steel.",
      "\u201cNeither the government nor the companies have publicly identified what all the terms of the proposed transaction are,\u201d the letter said. \u201cOur labor agreement expires next year, on September 1, 2026, and the USW and its members are prepared to engage the new owners\" of U.S. Steel \"to obtain a fair contract.\u201d",
      "If Trump has as much control of U.S. Steel as he has claimed, that could put him in the delicate position of negotiating the salary and benefits of unionized steelworkers going into midterm elections.",
      "As president, Joe Biden used his authority to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel on his way out of the White House after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.",
      "After he was elected, Trump expressed openness to working out an arrangement and ordered another review by the committee. That's when the idea of the \u201cgolden share\u201d emerged as a way to resolve national security concerns and protect American interests in domestic steel production.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel made a series of commitments.",
      "It gradually increased the amount of money it was pledging to invest in U.S. Steel, promised to maintain U.S. Steel\u2019s headquarters in Pittsburgh, put U.S. Steel under a board with a majority of American citizens and keep plants operating.",

      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- Britain\u2019s real-life spies have finally caught up with James Bond. MI6 has appointed its first female chief.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Sunday that Blaise Metreweli will be the next head of the U.K.\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, and the first woman to hold the post since its founding in 1909. She is currently the MI6 director of technology and innovation \u2014 the real-world equivalent of Bond gadget-master Q.",
      "A career intelligence officer, Metreweli, 47, steps from the shadows into the light as the only MI6 employee whose name is made public. She said \"I am proud and honored to be asked to lead my Service.\"",
      "Starmer said the \u201chistoric appointment\u201d comes at a time \u201cwhen the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital.",
      "\u201cThe United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale \u2013 be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber plots seek to disrupt our public services,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer made the announcement as he arrived in the Canadian province of Alberta for a Group of Seven leaders\u2019 summit.",
      "Metreweli takes over at MI6 as the agency faces growing challenges from states including China and Russia, whose use of cyber tools, espionage, and influence operations threatens global stability and British interests, even as it remains on alert against terrorist threats.",
      "Metreweli is the first woman to get the top job, known as C \u2013 rather than M, the fictional MI6 chief of the 007 thrillers. M was played onscreen by Judi Dench in seven Bond movies starting in the 1990s.",
      "She will take up her post in the fall, replacing Richard Moore, who has held the job for five years.",
      "Britain\u2019s two other main intelligence agencies have already shattered the spy world\u2019s glass ceiling. MI5, the domestic security service, was led by Stella Rimington from 1992 to 1996 and Eliza Manningham-Buller between 2002 and 2007. Anne Keast-Butler became head of electronic and cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ in 2023.",
      "Moore, an Oxford-educated former diplomat, fit the 007 mold like a Savile Row suit. But in recent years MI6 has worked to increase diversity, broadening its recruitment process from the traditional \u201ctap on the shoulder\u201d at an elite university. The agency\u2019s website stresses its family-friendly flexible working policy and goal of recruiting \u201ctalented people from all backgrounds.\u201d",
      "Moore suggested he would like his successor to be a woman. He wrote on X in 2023 that he would \u201chelp forge women\u2019s equality by working to ensure I\u2019m the last C selected from an all-male shortlist.\u201d",
      "Like many things about MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service, the process of choosing a new chief took place out of public view. It began with the country\u2019s top civil servant writing to government departments in March asking them to put forward candidates. The job was open to applicants from other intelligence agencies, the civil service, the diplomatic service, the armed forces or the police.",
      "In the end, MI6 opted for an internal candidate with a 25-year career in espionage, a degree in anthropology from Cambridge University \u2014 where she was on the women's rowing team \u2014 and expertise in cutting-edge technology.",
      "\u201cAt a time of global instability and emerging security threats, where technology is power and our adversaries are working ever closer together, Blaise will ensure the U.K. can tackle these challenges head on to keep Britain safe and secure at home and abroad,\u201d said Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who oversees MI6.",

      "ROME -- The Vatican on Sunday beatified a Congolese customs worker who was killed for resisting a bribe, giving young people in a place with endemic corruption a new model of holiness: Someone who refused to allow spoiled rice to be distributed to poor people.",
      "The head of the Vatican\u2019s saint-making office, Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, presided over the beatification ceremony of Florib\u00e8rt Bwana Chui Bin Kositi on Sunday at one of the pontifical basilicas in Rome, St. Paul Outside the Walls.",
      "The event attracted a cheering crowd of Congolese pilgrims and much of Rome's Congolese Catholic community, who will be treated to a special audience Monday with Pope Leo XIV.",
      "Faithful wore T-shirts and vests with Kositi\u2019s portrait and erupted in chants and applause as soon as the beatification ceremony was concluded, waving Congolese flags.",
      "Kositi was kidnapped and killed in 2007 after he refused to allow rancid rice from Rwanda to be transported across the border to the eastern Congo city of Goma.",
      "As an official with the Congolese government\u2019s custom\u2019s quality control office, the 26-year-old knew the risks of resisting bribes offered to public officials. But he also knew the risks of allowing spoiled food to be distributed to the most desperate.",
      "\u201cOn that day, those mafiosi found themselves in front of a young man who, in the name of the Gospel, said \u2018No.\u2019 He opposed,\u201d his friend Aline Minani said. \"And Florib\u00e8rt, I think that for me personally, I would say for all young people, is a role model.\u201d",
      "Pope Francis recognized Kositi as a martyr of the faith late last year, setting him on the path to beatification and to possibly become Congo's first saint. The move fit into the pope\u2019s broader understanding of martyr as a social justice concept, allowing those deemed to have been killed for doing God\u2019s work and following the Gospel to be considered for sainthood.",
      "\u201cOur country almost holds the gold medal for corruption among the countries of the world,\" Goma Bishop Willy Ngumbi told reporters last week. \"Here, corruption is truly endemic. So, if we could at least learn from this boy\u2019s life that we must all fight corruption \u2026 I think that would be very important.\u201d",
      "Transparency International last year gave Congo one of the poorest marks on its corruption perception index, ranking it 163 out of 180 countries surveyed and 20 on the organization\u2019s 0-100 scale, with 0 highly corrupt and 100 very clean.",
      "The beatification has brought joy to Goma at a time of anguish. Violent fighting between government forces and Rwanda-backed M23 rebels has led to the death of thousands of people and the rebels\u2019 capture of the city has exacerbated what already was one of the world\u2019s biggest humanitarian crises.",
      "It has renewed the hopes of many in the country of more than 100 million people whose development has been stifled by chronic corruption, which Francis railed about during his 2023 visit to the country.",
      "Speaking at the Kinshasa stadium then, Francis said Kositi \u201ccould easily have turned a blind eye; nobody would have found out, and he might even have gotten ahead as a result. But since he was a Christian, he prayed. He thought of others and he chose to be honest, saying no to the filth of corruption.\u201d",
      "The Italian priest who spearheaded Kositi\u2019s sainthood case, the Rev. Francesco Tedeschi, knew him through their work with the Saint'Egidio Community. He broke down Saturday as he recounted Kositi's example and Francis' call for the church to recognize the ordinary holiness in the \u201csaints next door.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the end, this was what Floribert was, because he was just a boy,\u201d Tedeschi said as he began weeping.",
      "On Sunday, worshippers gathered at the Saint Joseph Cathedral in Goma to follow Kositi\u2019s beatification ceremony live. Outside of the cathedral, some bought photos and cloth featuring his portrait.",
      "Olive Njemba, a 65-year-old mother who was close to Kositi's family, was one of them.",
      "\u201cThose who killed him thought that it was the end of his life, but Almighty God raised him up, and that is our joy,\u201d Njemba said while wearing the commemorative cloth she just bought. \u201cFor us mothers, we have great joy in buying this to celebrate our child who is now blessed.\u201d",
      "Inside the church, Abb\u00e9 C\u00e9lestin Kanyabiriri, head of the pastoral commission, made a brief speech ahead of the ceremony.",
      "\u201cThis event is not only for Catholics \u2014 he is a model for all of us,\u201d Kanyabiriri said.",
      "\u201cThe fact that he was chosen from our diocese, for me, is a sign that the Lord is inviting us to be apostles of honesty, apostles of moral integrity ... in order to fight against corruption \u2014 a cancer that has plagued our country from independence to today, especially starting from the very top of power,\u201d he added.",
      "At Goma\u2019s Floribert Bwana Chui School of Peace, which is named in honor of Kositi and advocates for social justice, his beatification is encouraging everyone who sees him as a role model, school director Charles Kalimba told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lesson for every generation, for the next generation, for the present generation and for all people. Floribert\u2019s life is a positive point that must be presented to the Congolese nation. We are in a country where corruption is almost allowed, and this is a challenge that must be taken up,\u201d Kalimba said.",
      "Tedeschi said the martyr designation recognized Kositi died out of hatred for the faith, because his decision to not accept the spoiled food was inspired by the Christian idea of the dignity of everyone, especially the poor.",
      "Being declared a martyr exempts Kositi from the requirement that a miracle must be attributed to his intercession before he is beatified, thereby fast-tracking the process to get to the first step of sainthood. The Vatican must, however, confirm a miracle attributed to his intercession for him to be canonized, a process that can take years or more.",

      "Millions of Americans are seeing their credit scores suffer now that the U.S. government has resumed referring missed student loan payments for debt collection",
      "NEW YORK -- Millions of Americans are seeing their credit scores suffer now that the U.S. government has resumed referring missed student loan payments for debt collection.",
      "After 90 days of non-payment, student loan servicers report delinquent, or past-due, accounts to major credit bureaus, which use the information to recalculate the borrower's score. Falling behind on loan payments therefore can affect an individual\u2019s credit rating as severely as filing for personal bankruptcy.",
      "A lower credit score makes it harder or more expensive to obtain car loans, mortgages, credit cards, auto insurance and other financial services at a time when inflation, high interest rates, and layoffs have strained the resources of some consumers.",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that in the first three months of 2025, 2.2 million student loan recipients saw their scores drop by 100 points, and an additional 1 million had drops of 150 points or more.",
      "Declines that steep may mean the difference between a manageable credit card interest rate and an unmanageable one, or approval or rejection of an application to rent an apartment.",
      "The U.S. Department of Education paused federal student loan payments in March 2020, offering borrowers relief during the economic chaos of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Though payments technically resumed in 2023, the Biden administration provided a one-year grace period that ended in October 2024. Last month, the Trump administration restarted the collection process for outstanding student loans, with plans to seize wages and tax refunds if the loans continue to go unpaid.",
      "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, about 1 in 4 people with student loan accounts were more than 90 days behind on payments at the end of March.",
      "Kat Hanchon, 33, who works in marketing and higher education in Detroit, was one of them. Hanchon said her score dropped by 57 points as a result of her loans falling delinquent this year. That put her score below 600, or subprime.",
      "When Hanchon received her statement from her loan servicer, her expected monthly payments were higher than before the pandemic-era pause, even though she had enrolled in a repayment plan that takes a borrower's full financial situation into account.",
      "\u201cThey said I now have to pay $358 per month,\" she said. \"I'm not going to be able to pay that. ... But I'm not unusual in the world we're living in right now.\"",
      "Hanchon said she's had to prioritize paying medical expenses \u2014 for a dental crown, a root canal, and an endoscopy \u2014 before she'll be able to consider putting money toward the loans. While her housing situation is secure for the moment, she worries about the annual percentage rate for her credit cards fluctuating.",
      "Lenders, landlords, credit card companies, employers and utility companies all look to consumers\u2019 credit scores to gauge the likelihood of borrowers being able to make regular payments. A higher score typically results in lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms, while a lower score makes it harder to access credit.",
      "The Education Department has said borrowers should receive bills from lenders three weeks before any payments are due, but some people have reported that they have not been notified.",
      "Wait times for calls with loan servicers have been high, and layoffs at the Department of Education have also likely contributed to delayed service, consumer advocates say.",
      "Dom Holmes, 28, who works for a nonprofit in Manheim, Pennsylvania, said he woke up in early May to find his credit score had dropped 60 or 70 points overnight.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden I was delinquent, even though I\u2019d never received notice,\u201d he said.",
      "Holmes has begun the process of appealing the reduction of his credit score, he said. He's been considering a move for professional reasons, and added that he's concerned it could be tough to rent a place to live with his score as it stands.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m at the ideal age where I should be starting a family and buying a home,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you destroy me financially, what are the chances I\u2019m able to do that and that\u2019s viable for me?\u201d",
      "Holmes, who was the first person in his family to graduate from college, said he still has some outstanding Parent Plus loans, which he intends to keep paying down so that his parents\u2019 credit scores aren\u2019t affected.",
      "He graduated in 2019, shortly before the pandemic, and said he can see how his generation might have difficulty paying off the debt.",
      "\u201cRight as I was entering the workforce, the world really stopped,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cThings were really bad for a lot of people for a long time. We\u2019re still coming out of that. And all of a sudden, the switches got turned back on overnight.\u201d",
      "Kevin King, vice president of credit risk at data and analytics company LexisNexis, said he expects the effects of the resumed student loan collections to begin rippling through the U.S. economy in the coming months.",
      "\u201cThere were a number of years where it was probably a bad financial strategy to be making student loan payments,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of consumers were confused as various government (policies of forgiveness) were passed and overruled.\u201d",
      "King predicts that student loan payments will move higher in the so-called \u201cpayment hierarchy,\u201d or the order in which consumers make payments, since the government plans to use \u201clevers to compel\" such as wage garnishment and the seizing of tax refunds.",
      "\u201cWhich bill do you pay first, second, and not at all?\u201d King said. \u201cHistorically, student loans are really far down the list. But the government\u2019s being pretty aggressive here in pursuing payment activity in a way that may shift the hierarchy. Consumers might be more willing to go delinquent or default on something like a credit card or installment loan.\u201d",
      "The Federal Reserve of New York study also found that borrowers ages 40 and older were most likely to be delinquent on their loans.",
      "Andrew McCall, 58, of Boise, Idaho, said he has about $30,000 remaining in outstanding loans from earning his computer science degrees. He said he can't afford his monthly payments, which are in the $250-300 range, and worries what a hit to his credit score might mean for all areas of his life.",
      "\u201cThe fact that this economy is driven by debt to begin with causes my score to be paramount no matter what financial decisions I\u2019m making, outside of going to the grocery store,\u201d he said. \u201cMy car, my house... Your credit rating becomes a social stratifier.\u201d",

They say consumers plan to spend an average of $199.38 on their dads and father figures this year.",

That is a 21% smaller gap than the $12.8 billion difference there was between Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day spending in 2023.",

      "Water guns are back squirting at unsuspecting tourists in Barcelona",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Protesters used water guns against unsuspecting tourists in Barcelona and on the Spanish island of Mallorca on Sunday as demonstrators marched to demand a rethink of an economic model they believe is fueling a housing crunch and erasing the character of their hometowns.",
      "The marches were part of the first coordinated effort by activists concerned with the ills of overtourism across southern Europe's top destinations. While several thousands rallied in Mallorca in the biggest gathering of the day, hundreds more gathered in other Spanish cities, as well as in Venice, Italy, and Portugal's capital, Lisbon.",
      "\u201cThe squirt guns are to bother the tourists a bit,\u201d Andreu Mart\u00ednez said in Barcelona with a chuckle after spritzing a couple seated at an outdoor caf\u00e9. \u201cBarcelona has been handed to the tourists. This is a fight to give Barcelona back to its residents.\u201d",
      "Mart\u00ednez, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, is one of a growing number of residents who are convinced that tourism has gone too far in the city of 1.7 million people. Barcelona hosted 15.5 million visitors last year eager to see Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade.",
      "Mart\u00ednez says his rent has risen over 30% as more apartments in his neighborhood are rented to tourists for short-term stays. He said there is a knock-on effect of traditional stores being replaced by businesses catering to tourists, like souvenir shops, burger joints and \u201cbubble tea\u201d spots.",
      "\u201cOur lives, as lifelong residents of Barcelona, are coming to an end,\" he said. \"We are being pushed out systematically.\u201d",
      "Around 5,000 people gathered in Palma, the capital of Mallorca, with some toting water guns as well and chanting \u201cEverywhere you look, all you see are tourists.\u201d The tourists who were targeted by water blasts laughed it off. The Balearic island is a favorite for British and German sun-seekers. Housing costs have skyrocketed as homes are diverted to the short-term rental market.",
      "Hundreds more marched in Granada, in southern Spain, and in the northern city of San Sebasti\u00e1n, as well as the island of Ibiza.",
      "In Venice, a couple of dozen protesters unfurled a banner calling for a halt to new hotel beds in the lagoon city in front of two recently completed structures, one in the popular tourist destination\u2019s historic center where activists say the last resident, an elderly woman, was kicked out last year.",
      "Protesters in Barcelona blew whistles and held up homemade signs saying \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident.\u201d They stuck stickers saying \u201cCitizen Self-Defense,\u201d in Catalan, and \u201cTourist Go Home,\u201d in English, with a drawing of a water gun on the doors of hotels and hostels.",
      "There was tension when the march stopped in front of a large hostel, where a group emptied their water guns at two workers positioned in the entrance. They also set off firecrackers next to the hostel and opened a can of pink smoke. One worker spat at the protesters as he slammed the hostel\u2019s doors.",
      "American tourists Wanda and Bill Dorozenski were walking along Barcelona\u2019s main luxury shopping boulevard where the protest started. They received a squirt or two, but she said it was actually refreshing given the 83 degree Fahrenheit (28.3 degrees Celsius) weather.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s lovely, thank you sweetheart,\u201d Wanda said to the squirter. \u201cI am not going to complain. These people are feeling something to them that is very personal, and is perhaps destroying some areas (of the city).\u201d",
      "There were also many marchers with water guns who didn't fire at bystanders and instead solely used them to spray themselves to keep cool.",
      "Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with mass tourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Spain, where protesters in Barcelona first took to firing squirt guns at tourists during a protest last summer.",
      "There has also been a confluence of the pro-housing and anti-tourism struggles in Spain, whose 48 million residents welcomed record 94 million international visitors in 2024. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Spanish authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry while not hurting an industry that contributes 12% of gross domestic product.",
      "Last month, Spain\u2019s government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform that it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told The Associated Press shortly after the crackdown on Airbnb that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being. Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "The boldest move was made by Barcelona's town hall, which stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing last year the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "That sentiment was back in force on Sunday, where people held up signs saying \u201cYour Airbnb was my home.\u201d",
      "The short-term rental industry, for its part, believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb\u2019s general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago recently told the AP.",
      "That argument either hasn\u2019t trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn\u2019t resonating.",
      "Txema Escorsa, a teacher in Barcelona, doesn\u2019t just oppose Airbnb in his home city, he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\u201cIn the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\u201d he said.",

      "With other leaders wanting to talk to Trump in an effort to talk him out of imposing tariffs, the summit risks being a series of bilateral conversations rather than a show of unity.",
      "Trump is the summit wild card. He arrived at the international summit sporting a \u201cMake America Great Again\" hat. He was greeted by four Mounties. Looming over the meeting are his inflammatory threats to make Canada the 51st state and take over Greenland. French President Emmanuel Macron visited Greenland on Sunday for a highly symbolic stop on his way to Canada. Macron warned that Greenland is \u201cnot to be sold\u201d nor \u201cto be taken.\"",
      "\u201cEverybody in France, the European Union thinks that Greenland is not to be sold, not to be taken,\u201d he said during a news conference, applauded by the local crowd.",

      "Trump's plane landed in Alberta late Sunday. He will have a bilateral meeting with Carney on Monday morning before the summit program begins.",
      "Leaders who are not part of the G7 but have been invited to the summit by Carney include the heads of state of India, Ukraine, Brazil, South Africa, South Korea, Australia, Mexico and the UAE. Avoiding tariffs will continue to be top of mind.",
      "Asked if he planned to announce any trade agreements at the G7 as he left the White House on Sunday, Trump said: \u201cWe have our trade deals. All we have to do is send a letter: \u2018This is what you\u2019re going to have to pay.\u2019 But I think we\u2019ll have a few, few new trade deals.\u201d",
      "Bilateral meetings with the American president can be fraught as Trump has used them to try to intimidate the leaders of Ukraine and South Africa.",
      "Former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien told a panel this week that if Trump does act out, leaders should ignore him and remain calm like Carney did in his recent Oval Office meeting.",
      "\u201cHe tends to be a bully,\u201d Chr\u00e9tien said. \u201cIf Trump has decided to make a show to be in the news, he will do something crazy. Let him do it and keep talking normally.\u201d",
      "Last month Britain and the U.S. announced they had struck a trade deal that will slash American tariffs on U.K. autos, steel and aluminum. It has yet to take effect, however, though British officials say they are not concerned the Trump administration might go back on its word.",
      "Starmer\u2019s attempts to woo Trump have left him in an awkward position with Canada, the U.K.\u2019s former colony, close ally and fellow Commonwealth member. Starmer has also drawn criticism \u2014 especially from Canadians \u2014 for failing to address Trump\u2019s stated desire to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Asked if he has told Trump to stop the 51st state threats, Starmer told The Associated Press: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the precise conversations I\u2019ve had, but let me be absolutely clear: Canada is an independent, sovereign country and a much-valued member of the Commonwealth.\u201d",
      "The war in Ukraine will be on the agenda. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to attend the summit and is expected to meet with Trump, a reunion coming just months after their bruising Oval Office encounter which laid bare the risks of having a meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "Starmer met with Carney in Ottawa before the summit for talks focused on security and trade, in the first visit to Canada by a British prime minister for eight years.",
      "German officials were keen to counter the suggestion that the summit would be a \u201csix against one\u201d event, noting that the G7 countries have plenty of differences of emphasis among themselves on various issues.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration directed immigration officers to pause arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels, after President Donald Trump expressed alarm about the impact of aggressive enforcement, an official said Saturday.",
      "The move follows weeks of increased enforcement since Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and main architect of Trump's immigration policies, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers would target at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Trump's second term.",

This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\u201d",
      "While ICE's presence in Los Angeles has captured public attention and prompted Trump to deploy the California National Guard and Marines, immigration authorities have also been a growing presence at farms and factories across the country.",
      "Farm bureaus in California say raids at packinghouses and fields are threatening businesses that supply much of the country\u2019s food. Dozens of farmworkers were arrested after uniformed agents fanned out on farms northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County, which is known for growing strawberries, lemons and avocados. Others are skipping work as fear spreads.",

      "Tom Homan, the White House border czar, has repeatedly said ICE will send officers into communities and workplaces, particularly in \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions that limit the agency's access to local jails.",

If we can\u2019t arrest them in community, we\u2019re going to increase work site enforcement operation. We\u2019re going to flood the zone.\u201d",

      "They can become public, but it's almost always disclosed by a party in the transaction, such as a company \u2014 like U.S. Steel \u2014 that is publicly held, Brower said.",
      "The mechanics of how a golden share would work will depend on the national security agreement, but in such agreements it isn't unusual to give the government approval rights over specific activities, Brower said.",
      "U.S. Steel made no filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.",
      "Nippon Steel originally offered nearly $15 billion to purchase U.S. Steel in an acquisition that had been delayed on national security concerns starting during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel gradually increased the amount of money it was pledging to invest into U.S. Steel. American officials now value the transaction at $28 billion, including the purchase bid and a new electric arc furnace \u2014 a more modern steel mill that melts down scrap \u2014 that they say Nippon Steel will build in the U.S. after 2028.",
      "Nippon Steel had pledged to maintain U.S. Steel\u2019s headquarters in Pittsburgh, put U.S. Steel under a board with a majority of American citizens and keep plants operating.",
      "It also said it would protect the interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters and it wouldn\u2019t import steel slabs that would compete with U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.",
      "Trump opposed the purchase while campaigning for the White House, and using his authority Biden blocked the transaction on his way out of the White House. But Trump expressed openness to working out an arrangement once he returned to the White House in January.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he would as president have \u201ctotal control\u201d of what U.S. Steel did as part of the investment.",
      "Trump said then that the deal would preserve \u201c51% ownership by Americans,\u201d although Nippon Steel has never backed off its stated intention of buying and controlling U.S. Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary.",
      "\u201cWe have a golden share, which I control,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump added that he was \u201ca little concerned\u201d about what presidents other than him would do with their golden share, \u201cbut that gives you total control.\u201d",
      "The proposed merger had been under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, during the Trump and Biden administrations.",

      "The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched consumer sentiment index, released Friday, jumped 16% from 52.2 to 60.5. The large increase followed steady drops that left the preliminary number last month at the second-lowest level in the nearly 75-year history of the survey.

      "BRUSSELS -- Less than two weeks before a NATO summit, Sweden and the Netherlands said Friday that they intend to increase defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, in line with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demands.",
      "Trump and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in the Netherlands on June 24-25, where they\u2019re due to agree a new defense spending target. He insists that Europe must look after its own security, while Washington focuses on China and its own borders.",
      "Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said that \u201cSweden will reach a new NATO spending target to 5% of GDP, where at least 3.5% of GDP will be allocated towards core defense requirements to fulfill NATO\u2019s new capability targets.\"",
      "\u201cWe are in a specific geographical situation where we need to meet the future threats from Russia,\u201d Kristersson told reporters in Stockholm, standing alongside NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.",
      "After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, NATO's 32 allies agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP on their military budgets. But NATO\u2019s new plans for defending Europe and North America against a Russian attack require investment of at least 3%.",
      "The aim now is to raise the bar to 3.5% for core defense spending on tanks, warplanes, air defense, missiles and hiring extra troops. A further 1.5% would be spent on things like roads, bridges, ports and airfields so armies can deploy more quickly, as well as preparing societies for possible attack.",
      "According to the most recent NATO figures, Sweden was estimated to have spent 2.25% of its GDP on defense last year. The Netherlands spent 2.06%, among 22 of the 32 allies who reached NATO\u2019s old benchmark.",
      "The Dutch caretaker government announced on Friday that it would increase spending on defense to 3.5% of GDP in an effort to meet the 5% goal. It\u2019s not clear where the approximately 18 billion euros ($20 billion) will come from.",

      "In landlocked Arizona, where the Colorado River crisis has put water use under a microscope, a new inland desert fish farm is growing barramundi \u2014 a tropical species native to Australia",
      "DATELAND, Ariz. -- Storks scatter, white against blue water, as Dan Mohring's pickup truck rumbles down the dirt road. He's towing a trailer full of ground-up beef, chicken, fish and nutrient bits behind him, ready to be shot out of a cannon into the ponds below.",
      "It's time to feed the fish.",
      "Mohring fires up the machine and the food flies out in a rainbow arc. Then the water comes alive. Hundreds of thrashing, gobbling barramundi wiggle their way to the surface, all fighting for a piece. Until, in a few months, they will become food themselves.",
      "In the desert of landlocked Arizona, where the Colorado River crisis has put water use under a microscope, Mainstream Aquaculture has a fish farm where it's growing the tropical species barramundi, also known as Asian sea bass, for American restaurants.",
      "Mainstream sees it as a sustainable alternative to ocean-caught seafood. They say chefs and conscious consumers like that the food has a shorter distance to travel, eliminating some of the pollution that comes from massive ships that move products around the world. And they and some aquaculture experts argue it's efficient to use the water twice, since the nutrient-rich leftovers can irrigate crops like Bermuda grass sold for livestock feed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the business of water,\u201d said Matt Mangan, head of Australia-based Mainstream\u2019s American business. \u201cWe want to be here in 20 years', 30 years' time.\u201d",
      "But some experts question whether growing fish on a large scale in an arid region can work without high environmental costs.",
      "That question comes down to what people collectively decide is a good use of water. In Arizona, some places manage water more aggressively than others. But the whole state is dealing with the impacts of climate change, which is making the region drier and water only more precious.",
      "The farm uses groundwater, not Colorado River water. It's a nonrenewable resource, and like mining, different people and industries have different philosophies about whether it should be extracted.",
      "\u201cAs long as groundwater is treated as an open resource in these rural parts of Arizona, they\u2019re susceptible to new industries coming in and using the groundwater for that industry,\u201d said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University's Morrison Institute.",
      "Some scientists believe aquaculture can play a role in protecting wild ocean ecosystems from overfishing. And it might play at least a small role in smoothing any supply problems that result from the Trump administration's tariffs on imports from dozens of countries, including those that send the U.S. about 80% of its seafood, per the United States Department of Agriculture.",
      "In the greenhouses at University of Arizona professor Kevin Fitzsimmons' lab in Tucson, tilapia circle idly in tanks that filter down into tubs full of mussels and floating patches of collard greens and lettuce. Fitzsimmons mentored the student who started the tilapia farm eventually bought by Mainstream about three years ago where they now raise barramundi.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think desert agriculture is going away,\" he said. \u201cObviously, we want to do it as water-efficient as possible.\"",
      "But not everyone agrees it's possible.",
      "\u201cArtificial ponds in the desert are stupid,\u201d said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at ASU and director of science for the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative. He worried about heavy water losses to evaporation.",
      "Mangan says that evaporation hasn't been an issue so much as the loss of heat in the wintertime. That has required pumping more water since its warmth when it arrives at the surface helps keep the barramundi cozy. But Mangan says they've been improving pond design to retain heat better and have found, after the last year of research and development, that they can cut their water requirement by about half as a result.",
      "Plus, he argues, the water coming out of the fish ponds is \"essentially liquid fertilizer,\" and though it's slightly salty, they use it for crops that can tolerate it, like Bermuda grass dairy cows can eat.",
      "But that's supporting the cattle industry, which contributes more than its share of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, Famiglietti said.",
      "\u201cDoing two suboptimal things doesn't make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Purple flowers sprout alongside paddle wheels. Fish bones crunch underfoot. The faint odor of brackish water and ammonia catches in the breeze.",
      "Without groundwater, none of it would be possible.",
      "Some farmers in Arizona rely on water from the Colorado River, but many others use well water to irrigate crops like alfalfa for the dairy industry or the lettuce, cucumbers and melons shipped nationwide year-round.",
      "Arizona has seven areas around the state where groundwater is rigorously managed. Dateland doesn't fall into one of those, so the only rule that really governs it is a law saying if you land own there, you can pump a \u201creasonable\u201d amount of groundwater, said Rhett Larson, who teaches water law at ASU.",
      "What might be considered \u201creasonable\u201d depends from crop to crop, and there's really no precedent for aquaculture, an industry that hasn't yet spread commercially statewide.",
      "Using numbers provided by Mainstream, Porter calculated that the fish farm would demand a \u201cvery large amount\u201d of water, on par with a big ranch or potentially even more than some suburbs of Phoenix. And she noted that although the water use is being maximized by using it twice, it's still depleting the aquifer.",
      "When the company scoped out Arizona to expand, Mangan said they didn\u2019t see nearly the same kinds of regulations as back in Australia.",
      "As part of its growth strategy, Mainstream is also hoping to work with other farmers in the area so more can use nutrient-rich fish pond wastewater to produce hay. They say a few have expressed interest.",
      "The seafood industry needs to reduce its reliance on catching small wild fish to feed bigger farmed ones that humans eat, said Pallab Sarker, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies sustainability in the aquaculture industry. He said seabirds and mammals rely on small species like anchovies and mackerel commonly used in fish meal.",
      "\u201cWe should not rely on ocean fish to grow fish for aquaculture to meet the demand for humans,\u201d Sarker said.",
      "Mainstream gets its fish feed from two suppliers, Skretting and Star Milling, but Mangan and Mohring said they didn't know for certain where those suppliers got their base ingredients from.",
      "Fitzsimmons, of the University of Arizona, also pointed out that between pollution, overfishing and oceanfront development for recreation, the commercial fishing industry had already been facing problems. He doesn't think that Trump's moves this spring to open up marine protected areas for commercial fishing will improve that situation the way aquaculture could.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hunting and gathering from the ocean,\u201d Fitzsimmons said.",

      "Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS fell nearly 3% in morning trading as they made their debut Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "Trading in New York is a long-held goal for JBS, which was founded 72 years ago and is now one of the world's largest meat companies. Half of its annual revenue comes from the U.S., where it has more than 72,000 employees. JBS is America\u2019s top beef producer and its second-largest producer of poultry and pork.",
      "JBS's minority shareholders voted last month to approve the company's plan to list its shares both in Sao Paulo and New York, casting aside opposition from environmental groups, U.S. lawmakers and others who noted JBS\u2019 record of corruption, monopolistic behavior and environmental destruction.",
      "JBS said a dual listing would give it broader access to investors and more competitive interest rates, which would help it finance its growth. It has also said a U.S. listing would subject it to more oversight from regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved JBS's planned listing last month.",
      "Still, the proposed listing has received significant pushback. Earlier this week, Mighty Earth, an environmental group, said it sent a letter to the NYSE board urging it to decline the listing. Mighty Earth contends that JBS is illegally profiting from deforested land in Brazil.",
      "Glass Lewis, an influential independent investor advisory firm, was also among those recommending that JBS's shareholders reject the planned listing.",
      "In its report, Glass Lewis said the recent return of brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista to the JBS board should concern investors. The brothers, who are the sons of JBS\u2019 founder, were briefly jailed in Brazil in 2017 on bribery and corruption charges.",
      "Glass Lewis also objected to the company\u2019s plan for dual share classes, which give the Batistas and other controlling shareholders more voting power.",
      "JBS said the outcome showed shareholders were confident in the benefits a dual listing would bring.",

      "AHMEDABAD, India -- The Air India plane crash this week was one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters, killing 241 people on board and several people on the ground.",
      "Indian authorities said Friday the investigation into the crash was underway, which is expected to include experts from the plane's maker Boeing and U.S. aviation regulators.",
      "The Air India plane crashed minutes after takeoff Thursday afternoon in the northwestern city of Ahmedabad. Surreal images captured both the plane's last moments and the horror of the crash site, with rescuers picking through smoking debris as they searched for survivors.",
      "Here's what is known about the crash:",
      "The lone survivor was a passenger, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, a British national of Indian origin.",
      "Ramesh was thrown from the aircraft and walked to an ambulance, according to Dr. Dhaval Gameti, who treated Ramesh. The doctor told The Associated Press that Ramesh was disoriented, with multiple injuries, but that he seemed to be out of danger.",
      "Another medic said Ramesh told him that immediately after the plane took off, it began descending and suddenly split in two, throwing him out before a loud explosion.",
      "The airline said there were no other survivors among the 242 passengers and crew on board.",
      "Security camera footage verified by The Associated Press showed the plane taking off and then veering slightly to the side. It then drops into a downward glide, disappears briefly from sight and hits the ground.",
      "Moments later, a huge orange and black fireball appears, rising high into the air.",
      "At the crash site, the tail cone of the aircraft with damaged stabilizer fins still attached was lodged near the top of a building. The plane's jagged cavity has torn into the facade. A web of cracks spirals outward from the plane's impact.",
      "The battered building in Ahmedabad was the dining area for medical students, and they were having lunch when the plane crashed.",
      "Indrajeet Singh Solanki, an eyewitness and rescuer, said that at first it was chaotic, smoke everywhere.",
      "\"We could see some small parts (of the plane) burning. Just like this wing lying over here,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough the smoke, we kept rescuing injured people and rushed them to the trauma center in the civil hospital in auto rickshaws. We rushed nine people to the hospital.\u201d",
      "The airline had been plagued by tragedy and financial losses under prior state ownership.",
      "In 2010, an Air India flight arriving from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, overshot the runway in Mangalore, India, and plunged over a cliff, killing 158 of the 166 people on board. In 2020, a flight for the Air India Express subsidiary skidded off a runway in southern India during heavy rain and cracked in two \u2014 killing 18 people and injuring more than 120 others.",
      "An Air India Boeing 747 flight crashed into the Arabian Sea in 1978, killing all 213 aboard.",
      "The carrier was under government control from 1953 through 2022.",
      "The Boeing 787 went into service in 2009. This was the first crash of the model, according to the Aviation Safety Network database.",
      "The 787 Dreamliner was the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium ion batteries, which are lighter, recharge faster and can hold more energy than other types of batteries. In 2013 the 787 fleet was temporarily grounded because of overheating of its lithium-ion batteries, which in some cases sparked fires.",
      "There was no information yet about possible causes of the crash. Authorities were searching the crash site Friday as part of the investigation, and there was no word whether the plane's black boxes \u2014 the flight data and cockpit voice recorders \u2014 had been recovered.",

      "Canada is hosting a Group of Seven meeting that will include U.S. President Donald Trump, who is waging a trade war against America\u2019s allies",
      "TORONTO -- U.S. President Donald Trump will arrive Sunday for a Group of Seven summit in a country he has suggested should be annexed and as he wages a trade war with America\u2019s longstanding allies.",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who won his office by pledging to confront the U.S. president\u2019s increased aggression, now hosts the G7 summit.",
      "Carney asserted this week that Washington no longer plays a predominant role on the world stage, imposing tariffs for access to its markets and reducing its contributions to collective security.",
      "Carney has decided to abandon the annual practice of issuing a lengthy joint statement, or communiqu\u00e9, at the summit\u2019s conclusion as French President Emmanuel Macron did at the G7 summit in France in 2019.",
      "The document typically outlines the consensus reached by leaders on summit issues and provides a roadmap for how they plan to tackle them.",
      "Trump roiled the 2017 meeting in Italy over the climate change passage in that summit\u2019s final statement. He then withdrew his support from the 2018 communiqu\u00e9 after complaining he had been slighted by then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the host that year.",
      "The leaders of the world's richest countries begin arriving Sunday in the resort town of Kananaskis, Alberta in the Canadian Rockies.",
      "The Group of Seven comprises Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Germany and Britain. The European Union also attends as well as other heads of state who are not part of the G7 but have been invited by Carney.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend and is expected to meet with Trump, a reunion coming just months after their contentious Oval Office encounter, which laid bare the risks of having a meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "Other world leaders will be meeting with Trump both in a group setting and for bilateral talks, which are often precarious as foreign leaders must navigate between placating and confronting him.",
      "\u201cAnything could happen. The Canadians would be crazy not to anticipate something. We can\u2019t tell. That\u2019s Trump stock and trade. He likes to keep everyone guessing,\u201d said Robert Bothwell, a University of Toronto professor of Canadian history and international relations.",
      "\u201cIt all depends what kind of theater he\u2019s going to want to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum will attend and said she expects to have her first in-person meeting with Trump. On his way to Canada, Macron is making a notable stop in Greenland, the semi autonomous Danish territory that the U.S. president has also suggested annexing.",
      "Among the other newcomers are German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "Starmer will meet with Carney on Saturday in Ottawa before flying to Alberta.",
      "Carney also invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite accusations from Canada's national police force that agents of Modi's government were involved in \u201cwidespread\u201d violence in Canada.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, was invited but will not attend.",
      "The 2018 G7 summit in Quebec was thrown into disarray after Trump called Trudeau \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cweak,\" while complaining that he had been blindsided by Trudeau\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s tariff threats at a summit-ending news conference. Trump pulled out of the G7 group statement just as it was released.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t too happy because we thought we managed to pull off a pretty good summit,\u201d said Peter Boehm, Canada\u2019s deputy minister for the Quebec summit.\" The reaction \u2014 and I was with Mr. Trudeau at the time \u2014 was a bit of disbelief.\"",
      "Boehm expects a chair's summary from Carney this year instead of a joint statement from the leaders.",
      "During the Quebec summit, Trump also insisted on Russia's readmission to the elite group, from which it was ousted in 2014 following President Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea.",
      "\u201cTrump raised that at the foreign policy dinner,\" Boehm recalled. \u201cIt was a bit awkward because British Prime Minister Theresa May was there and some British citizens had just been killed by Russian operatives using a toxic agent.\u201d",
      "Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were targeted in a nerve agent attack a few months before the Quebec summit in the English city of Salisbury.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra has said that Carney has been quietly holding direct talks with Trump about a trade deal in the lead up to the summit. Separately, top Canadian cabinet ministers have also been in Washington for negotiations in recent weeks.",
      "Trade tensions may be unavoidable. The United States runs trade deficits with all G7 countries except the United Kingdom. In an effort to balance what he describes as America\u2019s lopsided trade relations, Trump has imposed 10% import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on almost every country in the world. He also announced bigger tariffs, then suspended them, on countries that sell more to the United States than they buy.",
      "\u201cThe big X Factor (is) the looming tariffs,\u201d said Max Bergmann of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe G7 is supposed to provide global economic governance. And the way the Europeans see it right now is that the country that\u2019s the source of major instability in global economic affairs is the United States.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump\u2019s trade wars are already threatening the world economy. The World Bank on Tuesday sharply downgraded its forecast for global economic growth this year, citing \u201ca substantial rise in trade barriers.\u2019\u2019",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte will attend the G7 meeting ahead of this month's NATO summit and has said most U.S. allies in the alliance endorse Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense needs.",
      "Carney said this week Canada would meet NATO's current 2% target but seemed to suggest he would not support 5%, saying his goal is to protect Canadians, and not to satisfy NATO accountants.",
      "Law enforcement overseeing security expect large protests but say protesters won't be able to get anywhere near Kananaskis, as access roads to the summit will be closed to the public.",
      "The Mounties say there will be designated G7 demonstration zones in Calgary and Banff, Alberta that will have live audio and video feeds, which will be broadcast to G7 leaders and delegations at the summit. Kananaskis also hosted a G8 summit in 2002.",

There was no information on whether the black boxes \u2014 the flight data and cockpit voice recorders \u2014 had been recovered.",
      "The plane hit a building hosting a medical college hostel and burst into flames, killing several students, in the city that is the capital of Gujarat, Modi\u2019s home state.",
      "\u201cWe are all devastated by the air tragedy in Ahmedabad. The loss of so many lives in such a sudden and heartbreaking manner is beyond words,\u201d Modi said on social media after visiting the site. \u201cWe understand their pain and also know that the void left behind will be felt for years to come.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Phuket International Airport in southern Thailand said Friday it received a report that a pilot of Air India flight AI 379, which was bound for New Delhi, found a bomb threat message shortly after the morning flight took off.",
      "The plane requested an emergency landing back at Phuket and all 156 passengers were evacuated before authorities began an inspection of the plane, the airport said. The inspection results were not immediately announced.",
      "The survivor was seen in television footage meeting Modi at the government hospital where he was being treated for burns and other injuries.",
      "Viswashkumar Ramesh told India's national broadcaster he still can\u2019t believe he was alive. He said the aircraft seemed to become stuck immediately after takeoff. He said then the lights came on, and right after that it accelerated but seemed unable to gain height before it crashed.",
      "He said the side of the plane where he was seated fell onto the ground floor of a building and there was space for him to escape after the door broke open. He unfastened his seat belt and forced himself out of the plane.",
      "\u201cWhen I opened my eyes, I realized I was alive,\u201d he said.",
      "India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau is investigating, and the U.S. participants in the probe are expected to include people from the National Transportation Safety Board, Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing and General Electric.",
      "Medics are conducting DNA tests to identify those killed, the president of the Federation of All India Medical Association, Akshay Dongardiv, said. Meanwhile, grieving families gathered outside the Civil hospital in Ahmedabad on Friday.",
      "Two doctors at the hospital said the bodies of four medical students killed on the ground after the plane crash were handed to their families. They said at least 30 other injured students were still admitted in the hospital and at least four of them were critical.",
      "Modi held a meeting with senior officials Friday and met some of those injured on the ground during the hospital visit.",
      "Thursday\u2019s Air India crash involved a 12-year-old Boeing 787. Boeing planes have been plagued by safety issues on other types of aircraft.",
      "According to experts, there are currently around 1,200 of the 787 Dreamliner aircraft worldwide and this was the first deadly crash in 16 years of operation.",
      "Indian conglomerate Tata Sons took over Air India in 2022, returning the debt-saddled national carrier to private ownership after decades of government control. Since the takeover, Air India has ordered hundreds of new planes, redesigned its branding and livery and absorbed smaller airlines Tata held stakes in.",
      "Residents living in the vicinity, who were among the first to rush to the crash site and help with rescue, described the scale of damage like they had never seen.",
      "\u201cIn the beginning, I couldn\u2019t understand anything, it was only smoke everywhere. We could see some small parts (of the plane) burning,\u201d Indrajeet Singh Solanki said.",

      "The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 6,045.26. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2% to 42,967.62, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.2% to 19,662.48.",

      "Stocks broadly got some help from easing Treasury yields in the bond market following the latest update on inflation. Thursday\u2019s update said inflation at the wholesale level wasn\u2019t as bad last month as economists expected, and it followed a report on Wednesday saying something similar about the inflation that U.S. consumers are feeling.",
      "Wall Street took it as a signal that the Federal Reserve will have more leeway to cut interest rates later this year in order to give the economy a boost.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been hesitant to lower interest rates, and it\u2019s been on hold this year after cutting at the end of last year, because it\u2019s waiting to see how much President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs  will hurt the economy and raise inflation. While lower rates can goose the economy by encouraging businesses and households to borrow, they can also accelerate inflation.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.35% from 4.41% late Wednesday and from roughly 4.80% early this year.",
      "Besides the inflation data, a separate report on jobless claims also helped to weigh on Treasury yields. It said slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits  last week than economists expected, and the total number remained at the highest level in eight months. That could be an indication of a rise in layoffs.",
      "The Fed\u2019s next meeting on interest rates is scheduled for next week, but the nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street is that it will stand pat again. Traders are betting it\u2019s likely to begin cutting in September, according to data from CME Group.",
      "Trump\u2019s on-and-off tariffs have raised worries about higher inflation and a possible recession, which had sent the S&P 500 roughly 20% below its record a couple months ago. But stocks have since rallied nearly all the way back on hopes that Trump will lower his tariffs after reaching trade deals with other countries.",
      "Many of Trump\u2019s tariffs are on hold at the moment to give time for negotiations, but Trump added to the uncertainty late Wednesday when he suggested the United States could send letters to other countries at some point \u201csaying this is the deal.

      "Meta is making a $14.3 billion investment in artificial intelligence company Scale and recruiting its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing \u201csuperintelligence\u201d at the tech giant.",
      "The deal announced Thursday reflects a push by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to revive AI efforts at the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as it faces tough competition from rivals such as Google and OpenAI.",
      "Meta announced what it called a \u201cstrategic partnership and investment\u201d with Scale late Thursday. Scale said the $14.3 billion investment puts its market value at over $29 billion.",
      "Scale said it will remain an independent company but the agreement will \u201csubstantially expand Scale and Meta\u2019s commercial relationship.\u201d Meta will hold a 49% stake in the startup.",
      "Wang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale\u2019s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company\u2019s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats and Axon.",
      "Zuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014 is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.",
      "It won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. Microsoft hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft's AI division.",
      "Google pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept\u2019s AI systems and datasets.",
      "Wang was a 19-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he and co-founder Lucy Guo started Scale in 2016.",
      "They won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.",
      "Scale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors and Toyota have been among Scale's customers.",
      "What Scale offered to AI developers was a more tailored version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which had long been a go-to service for matching freelance workers with temporary online jobs.",
      "More recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models \u2014 the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama \u2014 brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams. The company claims to service \u201cevery leading large language model,\u201d including from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, by helping to fine tune their training data and test their performance. It's not clear what the Meta deal will mean for Scale's other customers.",
      "Wang has also sought to build close relationships with the U.S. government, winning military contracts to supply AI tools to the Pentagon and attending President Donald Trump's inauguration. The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.",
      "Meta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it's also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs.",
      "It hasn't yet released its purportedly most advanced model, Llama 4 Behemoth, despite previewing it in April as \"one of the smartest LLMs in the world and our most powerful yet.\u201d",
      "Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who in 2019 was a winner of computer science's top prize for his pioneering AI work, has expressed skepticism about the tech industry's current focus on large language models.",
      "\u201cHow do we build AI systems that understand the physical world, that have persistent memory, that can reason and can plan?\u201d LeCun asked at a French tech conference last year.",
      "These are all characteristics of intelligent behavior that large language models \u201cbasically cannot do, or they can only do them in a very superficial, approximate way,\u201d LeCun said.",
      "Instead, he emphasized Meta's interest in \u201ctracing a path towards human-level AI systems, or perhaps even superhuman.\u201d When he returned to France's annual VivaTech conference again on Wednesday, LeCun dodged a question about the pending Scale deal but said his AI research team's plan has \u201calways been to reach human intelligence and go beyond it.\u201d",

      "Fergus wrote on LinkedIn last month that Meta's commitment to long-term AI research \u201cremains unwavering\u201d and described the work as \u201cbuilding human-level experiences that transform the way we interact with technology.\u201d",

      "Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill plans to send a cease and desist letter to CVS for mass text messages sent to customers lobbying against legislation and is opening an investigation into whether the pharmaceutical giant improperly used customers\u2019...",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers' personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.",
      "Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.",
      "As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.",
      "\u201cLast minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy \u2014 your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,\u201d one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.",
      "The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.",
      "The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country\u2019s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.",
      "\u201cThese powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,\u201d a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.",
      "CVS says on its website that it \u201cnegotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.\u201d",
      "The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.",
      "\u201cThe proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients\u2019 ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThey would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care \u2013 the consequences would be dire.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers \u201cmay shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo we\u2019re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,\u201d McMakin said.",
      "Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.",
      "\u201cIt's in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve now taken that to send me political texts.\u201d",
      "CVS sent messages to \u201clarge numbers\" of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company's pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.",
      "Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information \u201cfor their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,\u201d Murrill told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s not why anybody gave them their phone number.\u201d",
      "Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.",
      "The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee \u2014 a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.",
      "\u201cWe believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,\u201d Thibault said in an email. \u201cOur communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state's legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.",
      "The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.",
      "Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS's lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn't be able to access their medications.",
      "\u201cCVS \u2026 you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,\u201d Landry said.",
      "The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.",
      "Landry said he plans to call a special session in hopes of passing similar legislation.",
      "\u201cYes we will have a special to lower prescription drugs for our citizens,\" Landry said a statement. \"It\u2019s that important.\u201d",

    "summary": "China has approved &ldquo;a certain number&rdquo; of export permits for rare earth elements and related items, its commerce ministry spokesman said on Thursday",
    "story": [
      "China has approved \u201ca certain number\u201d of export permits for rare earth elements and related items, its commerce ministry spokesman said on Thursday",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The high-level negotiations over China's export controls of rare earths is giving U.S. businesses some relief, even though it may be only for now.",
      "China has approved \u201ca certain number\u201d of export permits for rare earth elements and related items, its commerce ministry said on Thursday, one day after U.S. President Donald Trump declared that Beijing would supply to the U.S. companies those key elements and the magnets made from them following a two-day trade talk in London.",
      "\u201cI will be one of the happiest people out there if, if in fact, China starts to, to release some of those heavy rare earths and allows them to get into the world economy because the world economy is going to shut down without those heavy rare earths,\u201d said Mark Smith, chief executive officer of NioCorp., which is developing a new mine in Nebraska to produce niobium, scandium, titanium and an assortment of rare earths.",
      "Export controls of the minerals apparently eclipsed tariffs in the latest round of trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington, after China imposed permitting requirements on seven rare earth elements in April, threatening to halt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "Negotiators from the two governments said they reached a framework to move forward, with details yet to be agreed to by Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, but businesses welcomed the developments, even though uncertainties persist.",
      "Rare earth elements are some of the most sought-after critical minerals. Despite the name, they aren't actually rare, but it is hard to find them in high enough concentrations to make mining them economical. They are also difficult to extract from the ore, and China over the past several decades has built dominance in the processing capacity, supplying nearly 90% of the world's rare earths.",
      "In the heat of the tariff war with Trump, Beijing on April 4 announced permitting requirements for seven heavy rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium, citing the need to \u201cbetter safeguard national security and interests and to fulfill global duties of non-proliferation.\u201d",
      "The elements China has restricted, such as terbium and dysprosium, are key ingredients needed to make permanent rare earth magnets withstand high temperatures. That is crucial for a variety of uses in electric vehicles, wind turbines and military uses like jet engines and nuclear submarines.",
      "Some of the other rare earths needed for those magnets are produced at the only operating U.S. rare earths mine run by MP Materials in California, but China remains the only source of nearly all of what\u2019s known as the heavy rare earths. MP Materials previously sent the heavy rare earths that it mines to China for processing but it halted that in April amid the tariffs. The company is working to expand its own processing capability as soon as possible, and it is building a new magnet plant in Texas.",
      "Neha Mukherjee, rare earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, had previously predicted that most companies wouldn\u2019t start to run short of rare earths until later this year, but it appears some companies already have problems.",
      "\u201cThe overall market stockpile exists, but looks like a lot of OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), especially auto manufacturers, were not prepared, especially in Europe,\u201d Mukherjee said. Some American companies have stockpiled, but they \u201cmight start experiencing constraint if this continues.\u201d",
      "\u201cLooks like most of the stockpile is still in China hence the bottleneck in supply,\u201d Mukherjee said.",
      "On June 4, the European Association of Automotive Supplies said the industry was \u201calready experiencing significant disruption\u201d due to China\u2019s export restrictions on rare earths and magnets. \u201cThese restrictions have led to the shutdown of several production lines and plants across Europe, with further impacts expected in the coming weeks as inventories deplete,\u201d the group said.",
      "Details are still scarce on any agreement on rare earths shipments from China.",
      "On Thursday, He Yadong, spokesman for the Chinese commerce ministry, said China will \u201csufficiently consider the reasonable needs and concerns by all countries in the civilian field\" in reviewing applications of export permits for rare earths and related items.",
      "He said that it is consistent with international practice to put export controls on rare earths because they can be used for both civilian and military purposes.",
      "In a note, Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, wrote that even though there is an agreement for now, \u201csupply cutoffs will remain an ever-present threat.\u201d That's because China\u2019s licensing regime for the export of the seven heavy rare earths and related magnets is permanent, despite perceptions at the time that it was an act of retaliation, he wrote.",
      "China \"will probably not approve exports in sufficient quantity to allow U.S. customers to stockpile, ensuring that Beijing\u2019s leverage remains undiminished,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBeijing may approve few if any exports to U.S. defense companies and their suppliers.\u201d",
      "Smith of NioCorp. said even if the Chinese are offering a reprieve from their restrictions on rare earths, they will likely still keep limits in place on U.S. military uses.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m in the military and flying a jet or running a nuclear class submarine or a guided missile, I don\u2019t want that to fail because of high temperatures. So we have to have these heavy rare earths,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith said he hopes to find a solution to the problem of America being almost entirely dependent on China for these elements.",
      "\u201cI sincerely hope from the bottom of my heart that we use this situation as our final learning,\" Smith said. \u201cLet\u2019s take care of what we know needs to be taken care of.\u201d",

      "Morrison went 7 2/3 innings for his longest outing in over two months. The 6-foot-8, 245-pound right-hander retired 16 straight over the middle innings and left with two outs in the eighth after allowing five hits, walking none and striking out seven.",
      "\u201cFor us to play like that on this stage, pretty darn remarkable,\u201d coach Kevin Schnall said. \u201cThese guys were unbelievable tonight and then Jacob Morrison \u2014 winner's win.\u201d",

Turley hit his 20th homer leading off the bottom of the ninth against Hayden Johnson, and the Chanticleers had to call on closer Ryan Lynch to get the last out when the Beavers put two runners on base.

    "story": [
      "Famed Oakmont bared its teeth on the back nine at the U.S. Open",
      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- Tyrrell Hatton, in the mix in the final round of a major for the first time in the late Sunday gloom at the U.S. Open, watched his tee shot on the 17th hole drift to the right and exhaled.",
      "If there was a place to \u201cmiss,\u201d Hatton knew it was to the right of the green on the uphill, 314-yard par 4.",
      "And he was right. At just about every place but Oakmont.",
      "When Hatton reached the top of the hill, the fiery Englishman whose emotions are never too far from his sleeve discovered his ball had settled into the course's signature knotty rough on a downslope above a greenside bunker.",
      "Just about anywhere else, the shot rolls into the sand below, and he splashes out with a chance to maybe even take the lead. Only there isn't anywhere else like the iconic links-style course carved out of the Western Pennsylvania hills.",
      "Hatton's pitch from an impossible downhill lie didn't reach the green, and he slammed his club into the ground in protest. A chip and two putts later, he was two back. When his tee shot on the par-4 18th sailed into the rough again, it was over.",
      "\u201cWhat happened on 17 is going to hurt a lot for a long time,\u201d Hatton said after tying for fourth at 3-over 283, four back of winner J.J. Spaun. \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019ve been in contention in a major, and that was exciting, and unfortunately, I feel like through a bit of bad luck I had momentum taken away from me and ultimately ended up not being my day.\u201d",
      "Asked about what exactly constituted the \u201cbad luck,\u201d Hatton bristled but only briefly. He'd made his frustration about a course design that includes having most of its 160-plus bunkers well-guarded by an already penal rough well known on Saturday, when he was forced to take an awkward stance to hack out of a sand trap alongside the 15th green on Saturday, leading to a bogey.",
      "What happened in the waning minutes of a rain-delayed and chaos-filled final 18 holes of the championship was just more of the same.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve missed it in the right spot and got punished, which ultimately I don\u2019t think ends up being fair,\u201d Hatton said.",
      "That's Oakmont. Besides, Hatton was hardly the only one who found himself creeping up the leaderboard as the frontrunners faltered, only to ultimately succumb themselves.",
      "Carlos Ortiz, a member of LIV Golf like Hatton, was part of a five-way tie for the lead on the back nine. Ortiz's tee shot on the 503-yard par-4 15th sailed left, forcing him to punch out to the fairway. A wedge from 134 yards landed 40 feet short of the cup. Three putts later, he was on his way to a 3-over 73 finish and a tie for fourth.",
      "\u201cIt was a great week, but obviously I\u2019m disappointed right now the way it happened,\" said Ortiz, who became the first Mexican player since 1972 to place inside the top 10. \u201cI did everything I can.\u201d",
      "Viktor Hovland, who was out on the practice range nearly until dusk on Saturday night trying to find something \u2014 anything really \u2014 to build on, began the day two shots off the lead but never managed to get to pull even with the scrum in front of him.",
      "The Norwegian, who was grouped with Spaun, \u201csaw a lot of stuff\u201d as the leaderboard continued to shuffle and re-shuffle over the final 90 minutes. Keeping track was difficult, particularly with the electronic boards having \u201cdangerous weather\" alerts splashed across them. Ultimately, Hovland couldn't find the rhythm necessary.",
      "Instead, it was Spaun who delivered with a pair of birdies, including a 64-footer on the 18th that immediately etched itself into U.S. Open lore. In a way, the ending helped. Spaun went out and took a tournament up for grabs and grabbed it.",
      "Hovland, who called the last of Spaun's 279 strokes \u201cabsolutely filthy,\u201d had to settle for third, his fourth finish inside the top three at a major. All without being the one standing on the green afterward with the trophy in hand.",

      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- Robert MacIntyre nearly matched the biggest final-round comeback in U.S. Open history.",
      "Instead, he had to settle for sole possession of second place, but on a day when so many contenders \u2014 including the winner \u2014 had their problems, MacIntyre handled both Oakmont and the weather with aplomb.",
      "MacIntyre shot a 2-under 68 on Sunday to finish the tournament at 1 over \u2014 two strokes behind J.J. Spaun. MacIntyre was seven strokes back of leader Sam Burns at the beginning of the day. He actually made up 10 shots on Burns but couldn't outlast Spaun.",
      "\u201cI think when I was walking up 14 or 12, and I seen a leaderboard that the leader was at even par. I kind of knew where I was at, I was at 3-over, I think, at the time,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cThe whole week, I\u2019ve said level par in my head. I\u2019m just looking for four even pars. Almost got there, but not quite.\u201d",
      "As MacIntyre spoke, Spaun was still out on the course. A playoff \u2014 or even an outright victory for MacIntyre \u2014 was still possible. When Spaun rolled in his majestic birdie putt on 18 to finish at 1 under, camera footage showed MacIntyre clapping.",
      "Arnold Palmer is still the only U.S. Open winner to come from seven strokes behind in the final round. He did it in 1960 at Cherry Hills.",
      "Palmer birdied six of his first seven holes that day. MacIntyre's rally was more about staying afloat and waiting for the leaders to fall back. The left-hander from Scotland actually bogeyed two of his first three holes to drop to 5 over, but a 58-foot putt for eagle on the par-5 fourth started him in the right direction.",
      "\u201cThat kind of settled me down,\u201d he said. \u201cThat got me into somewhat of a groove and back in the golf tournament. Then the back nine was just all about fighting.\u201d",
      "MacIntyre said he dried off his shirt and kept stretching during a 97-minute weather delay that interrupted the final round. Down the stretch he was sharp, hitting his tee shot just short of the green on the par-4 17th and moving to 1 over with a birdie there. He had a birdie putt from just over 30 feet on the last hole, but that one didn't drop, and Spaun finished the tournament with two straight birdies to win it.",
      "But MacIntyre did enough to make him earn it. Of the top six finishers, only MacIntyre shot under par on the final day. And the Scot was the only player in the field to shoot under par both Saturday and Sunday.",
      "\"Today was a day that I said to myself, Why not? Why not it be me today?\" he said. \u201cWhen I was going round, and I just trusted myself, trusted my caddie Mike (Burrow), trusted all the work that I\u2019ve done.\u201d",
      "MacIntyre was a member of Europe's victorious Ryder Cup team in 2023. He won his first two PGA Tour titles last year at the Canadian Open and Scottish Open.",
      "Although being from Scotland didn't necessarily give him an advantage in the wet weather at Oakmont.",
      "\u201cWhen that rain came on, I wouldn\u2019t be outside. I\u2019d be indoors like you guys,\u201d he said. \u201cFair-weather golfer now that I\u2019ve moved to the PGA Tour.\u201d",

      "The Boston Red Sox have traded Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants in a blockbuster deal",
      "BOSTON -- The Boston Red Sox traded slugger Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants on Sunday in a deal that could shake up pennant races on both coasts.",
      "San Francisco sent right-hander Jordan Hicks, lefty Kyle Harrison, outfield prospect James Tibbs III and minor league righty Jose Bello to Boston for the 28-year-old designated hitter, who had bristled at his demotion from third base this year.",
      "The Giants are two games back of NL West-leading Los Angeles after losing 5-4 to the Dodgers on Sunday night.",
      "Harrison was on his way to the bullpen to warm up for Sunday's start when he was called back to the clubhouse and informed of the trade. Reliever Sean Hjelle was told about 30 minutes before first pitch that he would start.",
      "\u201cYeah, it was a lot, and it was late, but you know what? This is something we really needed,\u201d Giants manager Bob Melvin said.",
      "\u201cTo get a guy like Devers \u2026 there\u2019s a lot you have to give up for him, but this fits us perfectly. It\u2019s a power left-handed bat, a guy that can go the other way and hit for power in our ballpark. I mean, it\u2019s tailor-made for us, so kudos to the front office to swing this.\u201d",
      "A three-time All-Star who signed a 10-year, $313.5 million contract with the Red Sox in 2023, Devers is batting .272 with 15 homers and 58 RBIs in 73 games, including a solo shot in Boston\u2019s 2-0 victory over the New York Yankees on Sunday that completed a three-game sweep.",
      "But his relationship with the team began to deteriorate when the team signed Gold Glove third baseman Alex Bregman during spring training and asked Devers to move to DH; he balked before agreeing to the switch. When first baseman Triston Casas sustained a season-ending knee injury, the Red Sox approached Devers about playing the field and he declined, saying the front office \u201c should do their jobs \u201d and look for another player.",
      "A day after Devers\u2019 comments to the media about playing first, Red Sox owner John Henry, team president Sam Kennedy and chief baseball officer Craig Breslow flew to Kansas City to meet with Devers and manager Alex Cora.",
      "The situation became more difficult when Bregman sustained what the team called a significant right quadriceps injury on May 23.",
      "\u201cEverybody around the league, I think, was paying attention to that. When any team is having some kind of drama like that, with a player like Devers \u2014 he basically was the face of the franchise,\" San Francisco shortstop Willy Adames said in an on-field interview during the ESPN broadcast.",
      "Buster Posey, a seven-time All-Star who took over as San Francisco\u2019s president of baseball operations in September, said he reached out to Craig Breslow, Boston's chief baseball officer, about two weeks ago. Trade talks picked up momentum over the past few days.",
      "Posey and Melvin declined to address what position Devers would play in San Francisco \u2014 \"That's a conversation for myself, Bob and Zack (general manager Zack Minasian) to have with him,\" Posey said \u2014 but they are convinced Devers' bat will have a significant impact on a lineup that has produced only 16 homers from the left side this season.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re excited about adding one of the best hitters in all of major league baseball to our lineup,\u201d Posey said. \u201cWe're obviously taking on a lot of dollars, but there\u2019s a belief that adding a guy like this puts us in a good position keep winning ballgames, get into the playoffs and try to win a World Series, which is our ultimate goal.\u201d",
      "The Red Sox have won five out of six against the rival Yankees over the last two weekends to improve to 37-36, but they are still fourth in the AL East, 6 1/2 games behind division-leading New York.",
      "Devers was 20 when he made his major league debut with the Red Sox in 2017. He helped the Red Sox win the 2018 World Series and led the team in RBIs for five consecutive seasons from 2020-24. He has finished in the top 20 in voting for AL MVP five times.",
      "The Giants have lacked slugging since Barry Bonds hit 45 homers in 2004; they are the only team in the majors who have not had a batter hit 30 homers since then. Devers has hit at least 30 homers in three different seasons.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tough losing (Harrison and Hicks) \u2026 but we\u2019re getting a guy back who changes the lineup, who\u2019s probably a top-10 hitter in baseball every year,\u201d Giants pitcher Logan Webb said.",
      "\u201cAny time you add a player of that caliber, I think you give yourself a chance every day.\u2029I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s gonna hit, but I don\u2019t think it really matters. The guy\u2019s a stud, plain and simple. I\u2019m excited about it.\u201d",
      "Devers is not the first Red Sox All-Star to be traded away: The team sent Mookie Betts to the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 2020 season in a salary dump -- just a year after he won the AL MVP award and led Boston to a franchise-record 108 wins and its fourth World Series title since 2004.",
      "But the Devers deal is perhaps most reminiscent of the 2004 midseason shakeup when Boston traded disgruntled shortstop \u2014 and fan favorite \u2014 Nomar Garciaparra.",
      "The Red Sox went on to win the World Series that year, ending their 86-year championship drought.",
      "The acquisition of Devers is the latest big move by Posey, 38. He signed Justin Verlander to a $15 million, one-year contract in January and Adames to a $182 million, seven-year deal in December.",
      "Harrison, 23, is 9-9 with a 4.48 ERA and 178 strikeouts in 39 games for the Giants over three seasons. Hicks, 28, was 5-12 with a 4.83 ERA and 139 strikeouts in 42 games over two seasons. Tibbs, 22, was the 13th overall pick in last year's draft; he is hitting .246 with 12 homers and 32 RBIs in 57 games for Single-A Eugene of the Northwest League this season. Bello, 20, is 1-0 with a 2.00 ERA in eight games for the Giants' rookie league team in Scottsdale, Arizona.",

      "The New Zealander led 60 of 100 laps Sunday at Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez to earn his first Cup victory since he won in his NASCAR debut at the inaugural 2023 street course race in Chicago. That victory changed his career trajectory and Van Gisbergen left Australia V8 Supercars, where he was a multiple champion, for a full-time move to NASCAR.",
      "Although he had success in the Xfinity Series \u2014 he won three races last year as Trackhouse Racing developed him for a Cup Series ride \u2014 Van Gisbergen has struggled this year at NASCAR's top level.",
      "He started the race ranked 33rd in the Cup standings with only one top-10 finish through the first 15 races of the season. But his victory in Mexico City earned him an automatic berth into NASCAR's playoffs with a shot to race for the Cup Series championship.",
      "Van Gisbergen benefitted from an early pop-up rain shower on the first lap of the race because he's an exceptionally skilled driver on a wet surface. His win at Chicago was in monsoon-like conditions.",
      "He won the pole in Mexico City and started the race as the BetMGM betting favorite, particularly since rain was in the forecast. He had to contend with several challengers, Ty Gibbs and Christopher Bell of Joe Gibbs Racing among them, but took the lead for good with 31 laps remaining.",
      "Trackhouse now has two of its drivers \u2014 Ross Chastain and Van Gisbergen \u2014 locked into the playoffs. But it was a bit of a disappointment for Daniel Suarez, the Monterrey native who thrilled the hometown crowd with a win in the Xfinity Series race on Saturday, as he failed to challenge his teammate for the win and finished 19th.",
      "Suarez, who appeared to be blinking back tears as he sang along with the Mexican national anthem in pre-race ceremonies, desperately wanted the home win in this contract year with Trackhouse. He was the face of this event as NASCAR ventured outside the U.S. with its top series for the first time since 1958.",

Chase Briscoe of JGR was seventh and followed by Cole Custer for Haas Factory as the highest-finishing Ford driver.

      "Shohei Ohtani is going to be the starting pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday night against San Diego, 21 months after the two-way star had elbow surgery",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Shohei Ohtani is going to be the starting pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday night against San Diego, 21 months after the two-way star had elbow surgery.",
      "The Dodgers made the announcement after Sunday night's 5-4 win over San Francisco. Ohtani likely will be used as an opener as the NL West leaders kick off a four-game set against the visiting Padres.",
      "\u201cShohei is getting antsy, which is a good thing for us,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before the team announced Ohtani would get the ball on Monday night.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be one or two innings, but my guess is probably an inning to start. But it\u2019s a good thing. The live, simulated, or whatever, sort of ran its course. He\u2019s ready to make his debut on the mound.\u201d",
      "Ohtani has not pitched in a game since Aug. 23, 2023, when he got hurt during a start for the Los Angeles Angels against Cincinnati. He had Tommy John surgery on Oct. 1, 2018, and is recovering from right elbow surgery on Sept. 19, 2023.",
      "In the second season of a $700 million, 10-year contract, he paused his pitching work after a mound session on Feb. 25 to prepare for opening day as a hitter, then started bullpen sessions on March 29 and batting practice on May 25.",
      "Roberts said he is excited to see Ohtani pitch in a big league game again.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of anticipation,\u201d he said. \"I think we\u2019ve done it the right way as far as our process, communicating with Shohei and feeling good. ... It\u2019s good for our team. Our guys are excited about this potential. And obviously, most important, I\u2019m excited for Shohei.\u201d",
      "A three-time MVP, Ohtani is hitting .297 with an NL-leading 1.035 OPS, 25 homers and 41 RBIs. A batter only last year in his first season with the Dodgers, Ohtani hit .290 with 54 homers, 130 RBIs and 59 stolen bases.",
      "On Sunday, Roberts said rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki appears likely to be sidelined for a lengthy stretch. With Sasaki (right shoulder impingement), Blake Snell (left shoulder inflammation) and Tyler Glasnow (right shoulder inflammation) on the injured list, the Dodgers have resorted to bullpen games.",
      "Sasaki has not pitched in a game since May 9 and is not part of the team\u2019s long-term pitching plans this season.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s what the mindset should be,\u201d Roberts said before the game. \"Being thrust into this environment certainly was a big undertaking for him, and now you layer in the health part and the fact he\u2019s a starting pitcher, knowing what the build-up (required to return) entails \u2026 I think that\u2019s the prudent way to go about it.\u201d",
      "Sasaki, 23, went 1-1 with a 4.72 ERA in eight starts after joining the Dodgers from the Pacific League's Chiba Lotte Marines, averaging less than 4 1/3 innings per start. His walked 22 and struck out 24 in 34 1/3 innings and his fastball averaged 95.7 mph, down 3-4 mph from his average in Japan.",
      "Roberts said Sasaki was pain-free when he resumed throwing in early June, but the pitcher was shut down after feeling discomfort this past week. Sasaki recently received a cortisone injection in the shoulder; Roberts said no further scans are planned.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s pain,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s discomfort, if it\u2019s tightness, if he\u2019s just not feeling strong, whatever the adjective you want to use. That\u2019s more of a question for Roki, as far as the sensation he\u2019s feeling.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just not feeling like he can ramp it up, and we\u2019re not going to push him to do something he doesn\u2019t feel good about right now.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "J",
      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- J.J. Spaun endured the toughest test in golf on the toughest course in America in the worst kind of conditions. And then he turned this miserable, wet Sunday at Oakmont into a finish as memorable as any in the U.S. Open.",
      "The champion not many expected delivered two shots no one will forget.",
      "First came his driver on the 314-yard 17th hole onto the green for a two-putt birdie that gave him the lead. Then, needing two putts from 65 feet on the 18th to win, he finished his storybook Open by holing the longest putt all week at Oakmont for birdie and a 2-over 72.",
      "For all the mess Oakmont became in a series of downpours, for all the bad breaks and bad lies and bad shots that cost so many contenders, Spaun overcame a start that would have ended hopes of more seasoned players and weathered the pressure to claim his greatest prize.",
      "\u201cI never thought I would be here holding this trophy,\u201d said Spaun, who finished last year at No. 119 in the world and moved up to No. 8 with his U.S. Open victory. \"I always had aspirations and dreams. I never knew what my ceiling was. I\u2019m just trying to be the best golfer I can be.",
      "\u201cI'm happy to display that here at Oakmont.\u201d",
      "He finished at 1-under 279, the sole survivor to par, and won by two shots over Robert MacIntyre of Scotland, who watched the finish from a scoring room and could only applaud the stunning conclusion.",
      "Five players shared the lead with an hour to go. Four players were still tied as the U.S. Open made its way to the final four holes that frustrated Sam Burns and Tyrrell Hatton, and crushed the hopes of Adam Scott and Carlos Ortiz.",
      "The last man standing was Spaun, the 34-year-old Californian with an eerie resemblance to the late Pittsburgh Steelers great Franco Harris.",
      "Never mind that Spaun lacked the pedigree of so many players groomed in elite competition, that he had only one PGA Tour title until Sunday, was playing in only his second U.S. Open and had never cracked the top 20 in his previous eight majors.",
      "The ending was magical. The road leading to his U.S. Open title was hard work and resiliency, especially Sunday. One shot behind to start the final round, he had five bogeys in six holes, including a shot that hit the pin on No. 2 and caromed 35 yards back into the fairway, turning birdie into a bogey.",
      "\u201cIt felt like as bad as things were going, I just still tried to just commit to every shot. I tried to just continue to dig deep. I\u2019ve been doing it my whole life,\u201d Spaun said. \u201cI think that\u2019s been the biggest difference this year has been being able to do that. Fortunately, I dug very deep on the back nine, and things went my way, and here we are with the trophy.\u201d",
      "It was calamity for so many others.",
      "Burns had a two-shot lead going to the 11th tee, made a double bogey from a divot in the first cut on No. 11 and from a lie in the fairway on No. 15 so wet he thought he deserved relief. He shot 78.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tough golf course, and I didn\u2019t have my best stuff, and clearly it showed,\u201d he said.",
      "Scott, trying to become the first player to go more than 11 years between major titles, was tied for the lead with five holes to play. One of the best drivers could no longer find the fairway. He played them in 5 over and shot 79.",
      "\u201cI missed the fairway. I hadn\u2019t done that all week really. Then I did, and I paid the price and lost a lot of shots out there,\u201d Scott said.",
      "Ortiz and Hatton also slashed away in slushy lies, all making mistakes that cost them a chance to survive this beast of day.",
      "The rain that put Oakmont on the edge of being unplayable might have saved Spaun.",
      "He was four shots behind and facing the tough ninth hole. And then came a rain delay of 1 hour, 37 minutes.",
      "\u201cThe weather delay changed the whole vibe of the day,\u201d Spaun said.",
      "Remarkably, he made only one bogey the rest of the way.",
      "But oh, that finish.",
      "MacIntyre, the 28-year-old from Oban toughened by the Scottish game of Shinty, became the new target. He also struggled at the start and fell nine shots behind at one point. But he birdied the 17th and split the fairway on the 18th for a key par, a 68 and the clubhouse lead.",
      "Three groups later, Spaun delivered what looked like the winner on the 17th, a powerful fade that rolled onto the green like a putt and settled 18 feet behind the cup.",
      "On the final putt, he was helped by Viktor Hovland being on the same line and going first. Spaun rapped it through the soaked turf, walked to the left to watch it break right toward the hole and watched it dropped as thousands of rain-soaked spectators erupted.",
      "He raised both arms and tossed his putter, jumping into the arms of caddie Mark Carens.",
      "The celebration carried into those who lost the battle.",
      "Hatton was talking with reporters, bemoaning a bad break on the 17th ended his chances of winning. He watched the Spaun's putt and it brightened his mood.",
      "\u201cUnbelievable. What a putt to win. That\u2019s incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sad about how I finished, but I\u2019m very happy for J.J. To win a major in that fashion is amazing.\u201d",
      "Hovland, who shot 73 to finish third, saw it all \u2014 the putt at the end, the bogeys at the start.",
      "\u201cAfter his start, it just looked like he was out of it immediately,\u201d Hovland said. \"Everyone came back to the pack. I wasn\u2019t expecting that really. I thought I had to shoot maybe 3-under par today to have a good chance, but obviously the conditions got really, really tough, and this golf course is just a beast.\u201d",
      "Hatton (72) and Ortiz (73), both part of LIV Golf and in serious contention at a major for the first time, tied for fourth along with Cameron Young (70). The consolation for Ortiz was getting into the Masters next year.",
      "Scottie Scheffler, 10 shots behind early in the final round, was somehow still part of the conversation on the back nine. But he missed far too many birdie chances even three-putting from 12 feet no the 11th hole. The world's No. 1 player finished with a 70 to tie for seventh with Jon Rahm (67) and Burns, his best friend who will feel the sting.",
      "He had a double bogey by missing the green into a bad lie on the slope of a bunker. He missed a pair of 6-foot birdie putts to seize control. And when he made a mess of the 15th for another double bogey.",
      "Through it all, Spaun emerged as a U.S. Open champion hardly anyone saw coming \u2014 not at the start of the year, not at the start of the round.",

      "The ratings are down for these NBA Finals, as was expected",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- The ratings are down for these NBA Finals, as was expected. Oklahoma City vs. Indiana is a small-market series and the numbers reflect that, with viewership down about 20% from last season and on pace for the poorest TV turnout since the pandemic \u201cbubble\u201d finals in 2020.",
      "Don't blame the Thunder and Pacers for that.",
      "It's been a back-and-forth over the first four games \u2014 and now, a best-of-three will decide the NBA title. Game 5 is in Oklahoma City on Monday night, with the Thunder trying to take their first lead of the series and the Pacers trying to head back home one win away from a championship.",
      "\u201cI do not care, to be honest with you,\" Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton said when asked what he'd say to those who, for whatever reason, haven't tuned into the series. \u201cThis is high-level basketball and I'm excited to be a part of it.\u201d",
      "Game 1 had a frantic Indiana comeback and a Haliburton buzzer-beater. Game 2 saw Oklahoma City do what it has done in the majority of games all season: take full control early and roll to a win. Game 3 in Indiana had the Pacers' bench fueling a win. And Game 4 saw the MVP do MVP things, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scoring 15 points in the final five minutes to carry the Thunder to a comeback win.",
      "Add it up, and it's Thunder 2, Pacers 2. The Thunder are outscoring the Pacers by 3.3 points per game; the Pacers are outshooting the Thunder by 1.4%. It's only the third time in the last 15 years that the finals have had all that through four games \u2014 2-2 tie, 3.3-point differential or less, shooting within 1.4% of each other. Golden State-Boston had it in 2022, and Dallas-Miami had it in 2011.",
      "It all seems pretty even, and the looks aren't deceiving.",
      "\u201cIt's good for y\u2019all,\" Thunder guard Alex Caruso said. \u201cGood for me, we\u2019d be getting ready for a parade right now.\u201d",
      "Parades in Indianapolis or Oklahoma City are going to have to wait at least until this coming weekend. This series seems like it could have debunked some of the tired complaints about the game in recent years: the nobody-plays-defense, too-much-isolation, too-many-3s arguments that have been out there.",
      "\u201cI think from an outside perspective it\u2019s great for the league,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for basketball. I think these two teams play stylistically the best versions of basketball right now as far as pressure and being influencing and aggressive on defense \u2014 causing turnovers, making stuff hard and then offensively free-flowing, shot making, passing the ball. ... A great brand of basketball.\u201d",
      "And that means it could end up as a great finals, whether more people start watching or not.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate the opportunity to play this deep into the season,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cIf you\u2019re playing this deep into the season, your opponent is going to be really good. They have won 12 games to get to this point just like we have. You just know it\u2019s going to be an unbelievable level. There are definitely times in it where (you're saying), \u2018Man, this is a high, high level.\u2019\"",
      "This marks the 32nd time that a finals has been 2-2 going into Game 5. The winner of Game 5 has gone on to ultimately prevail in 23 of the 31 previous occasions.",
      "\u201cWe are both two games away,\" Haliburton said. \u201cAnything can happen here.\u201d",

      "A new poll finds Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his public falling-out with President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.",
      "Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog \u201cvery favorably\u201d compared with April, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation \u2014 and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts \u2014 may have cost him some enthusiasm within the party.",
      "\u201cSome things have happened lately that have changed how I feel about him a little,\u201d said Alabama Republican Katye Long, whose feelings for Musk have cooled to \u201csomewhat favorable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked what he was doing when he was helping. But now I feel like he\u2019s kind of hurting,\u201d said the 34-year-old automotive component factory employee and mother of three from Woodstock, Alabama. \u201cI also don\u2019t feel like he matters that much. He\u2019s not actually part of the government. He\u2019s just a rich guy who pushes his opinions.\u201d",
      "Musk's overall popularity hasn't shifted, the poll found, and most of the shift among Democrats and Republicans was between \u201cvery\u201d and \u201csomewhat\u201d strong opinions. Americans are less likely to view him favorably than his electric vehicle company, Tesla. That said, about half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla, highlighting another challenge for Musk when the company has dropped in value and been the target of protests in the U.S. and Europe. About one-third have a favorable view of Tesla, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.",
      "Even a subtle shift in the intensity of Republicans\u2019 feelings about Musk could be important as the electric car and aerospace mogul weighs a second political act after spending about $200 million in service of Trump\u2019s 2024 election effort.",
      "After decrying the GOP\u2019s massive tax and budget policy bill as \u201ca disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, \u201cIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\u201d",
      "The poll suggests the messy feud with Trump may have rubbed some Republicans the wrong way, as the share of Republicans viewing Musk as \u201cvery favorable\u201d has dropped from 38% in April to 26% now. At the same time, antipathy toward Musk among Democrats has waned a little. About two-thirds, 65%, of Democrats have a very negative view of Musk, down slightly from about three-quarters, 74%, in April.",
      "Musk's bitter back-and-forth with Trump has business implications, too. Tesla was already struggling with a backlash against Musk's association with Trump. Sales across Europe plunged by half in May, even as growth in the electric car market accelerated. Then the company's shares plunged in value when Musk began sparring publicly with the president.",
      "Victoria Brown, of Kansas City, Kansas, rated Tesla \u201csomewhat unfavorable\u201d because she objects to how Trump is conducting his administration and links the company\u2019s owner with the president\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t favor Trump. So, pretty much the fact that they have been working together means I don\u2019t care too much for Tesla,\u201d said Brown, 63, a political independent and an insurance agent.",
      "While the intensity of people's feelings about Musk may have changed, their overall opinions have not. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Musk, compared with about 6 in 10 who hold an unfavorable view, while about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. That's unchanged from the April poll.",
      "The new poll was conducted June 5-9, after Musk left his government role and began attacking Trump's marquee legislative priority.",
      "Musk's public clash with Trump began four days after Trump honored Musk effusively during an Oval Office event discharging him from duties as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "After first tearing down the budget bill, Musk two days later complained he had never seen the language, and he aimed his fire at Trump, suggesting the president didn't sufficiently appreciate the role Musk assumed as the chief benefactor to Trump's reelection effort.",
      "\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cSuch ingratitude.\u201d",
      "Musk went on to claim without evidence that the federal government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Musk deleted the post, and early Wednesday he stepped back from his attacks on Trump, writing on X that he regretted some of his posts and they \u201cwent too far.\u201d",
      "Tesla endured a difficult first quarter in 2025, with its sales falling while the world\u2019s leading electric car manufacturer faced protests in showrooms. The new poll also shows that Tesla is viewed far more negatively than some of its peers \u2014 notably, Ford, Toyota and General Motors.",
      "Only about one-third of U.S. adults have a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable view of Tesla. About half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans. Democrats, at 66%, are more than twice as likely as Republicans to have a negative view of Tesla. But even among Republicans, Tesla is viewed less favorably than the other brands.",
      "Marisa Mills is no Musk fan. The 41-year-old teacher from Oakland, California, objects to his association with Trump and what the Democrat sees as their misguided notion that government is always well served by operating like a business.",
      "And yet she was once proud to have Tesla building cars in her own county. She soured on the company in 2020, when Musk sued Alameda County over its workplace restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, before he moved the company to Texas in 2021.",
      "\u201cMy government is supposed to serve the people, not his company. We were all glad to see him go,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI do regret that we now have feelings of regret for the Tesla car product. We were once so proud.\u201d",

      "Meta is making a $14.3 billion investment in artificial intelligence company Scale and recruiting its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing \u201csuperintelligence\u201d at the tech giant.",
      "The deal announced Thursday reflects a push by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to revive AI efforts at the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as it faces tough competition from rivals such as Google and OpenAI.",
      "Meta announced what it called a \u201cstrategic partnership and investment\u201d with Scale late Thursday. Scale said the $14.3 billion investment puts its market value at over $29 billion.",
      "Scale said it will remain an independent company but the agreement will \u201csubstantially expand Scale and Meta\u2019s commercial relationship.\u201d Meta will hold a 49% stake in the startup.",
      "Wang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale\u2019s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company\u2019s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats and Axon.",
      "Zuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014 is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.",
      "It won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. Microsoft hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft's AI division.",
      "Google pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept\u2019s AI systems and datasets.",
      "Wang was a 19-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he and co-founder Lucy Guo started Scale in 2016.",
      "They won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.",
      "Scale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors and Toyota have been among Scale's customers.",
      "What Scale offered to AI developers was a more tailored version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which had long been a go-to service for matching freelance workers with temporary online jobs.",
      "More recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models \u2014 the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama \u2014 brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams. The company claims to service \u201cevery leading large language model,\u201d including from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, by helping to fine tune their training data and test their performance. It's not clear what the Meta deal will mean for Scale's other customers.",
      "Wang has also sought to build close relationships with the U.S. government, winning military contracts to supply AI tools to the Pentagon and attending President Donald Trump's inauguration. The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.",
      "Meta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it's also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs.",
      "It hasn't yet released its purportedly most advanced model, Llama 4 Behemoth, despite previewing it in April as \"one of the smartest LLMs in the world and our most powerful yet.\u201d",
      "Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who in 2019 was a winner of computer science's top prize for his pioneering AI work, has expressed skepticism about the tech industry's current focus on large language models.",
      "\u201cHow do we build AI systems that understand the physical world, that have persistent memory, that can reason and can plan?\u201d LeCun asked at a French tech conference last year.",
      "These are all characteristics of intelligent behavior that large language models \u201cbasically cannot do, or they can only do them in a very superficial, approximate way,\u201d LeCun said.",
      "Instead, he emphasized Meta's interest in \u201ctracing a path towards human-level AI systems, or perhaps even superhuman.\u201d When he returned to France's annual VivaTech conference again on Wednesday, LeCun dodged a question about the pending Scale deal but said his AI research team's plan has \u201calways been to reach human intelligence and go beyond it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just that now we have a clearer vision for how to accomplish this,\u201d he said.",
      "LeCun co-founded Meta's AI research division more than a decade ago with Rob Fergus, a fellow professor at New York University. Fergus later left for Google but returned to Meta last month after a 5-year absence to run the research lab, replacing longtime director Joelle Pineau.",
      "Fergus wrote on LinkedIn last month that Meta's commitment to long-term AI research \u201cremains unwavering\u201d and described the work as \u201cbuilding human-level experiences that transform the way we interact with technology.\u201d",

      "New research says long-billed curlews listen to alarm barks from prairie dog colonies to protect themselves from predators",
      "WASHINGTON -- Prairie dogs are the Paul Reveres of the Great Plains: They bark to alert neighbors to the presence of predators, with separate calls for dangers coming by land or by air.",
      "\u201cPrairie dogs are on the menu for just about every predator you can think of\u201d\u2014 golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, foxes, badgers, even large snakes \u2014 said Andy Boyce, a research ecologist in Montana at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.",
      "Those predators will also snack on grassland nesting birds like the long-billed curlew.",
      "To protect themselves, the curlews eavesdrop on the alarms coming from prairie dog colonies, according to research published Thursday in the journal Animal Behavior.",
      "Previous research has shown birds frequently eavesdrop on other bird species to glean information about potential food sources or approaching danger, said Georgetown University ornithologist Emily Williams, who was not involved in the study. But, so far, scientists have documented only a few instances of birds eavesdropping on mammals.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s rare in the wild,\u201d she said, \u201cit just means we haven\u2019t studied it yet.\u201d",
      "Prairie dogs live in large colonies with a series of burrows that may stretch for miles underground. When they hear one each other\u2019s barks, they either stand alert watching or dive into their burrows to avoid approaching talons and claws.",
      "\u201cThose little barks are very loud \u2014 they can carry quite a long way,\u201d said co-author Andrew Dreelin, who also works for the Smithsonian.",
      "The long-billed curlew nests in short-grass prairie and incubates eggs on a ground nest. When one hears the prairie dog alarm, she responds by pressing her head, beak and belly close to the ground.",
      "In this crouched position, the birds \u201crely on the incredible camouflage of their feathers to become essentially invisible on the Plains,\u201d Dreelin said.",
      "To test just how alert the birds were to prairie dog chatter, researchers created a fake predator by strapping a taxidermied badger onto a small remote-controlled vehicle. They sent this badger rolling over the prairie of north-central Montana toward curlew nests \u2014 sometimes in silence and sometimes while playing recorded prairie dog barks.",
      "When the barks were played, curlews ducked into the grass quickly, hiding when the badger was around 160 feet (49 meters) away. Without the barks, the remote-controlled badger got within about 52 feet (16 meters) of the nests before the curlews appeared to sense danger.",
      "\u201cYou have a much higher chance of avoiding predation if you go into that cryptic posture sooner \u2014 and the birds do when they hear prairie dogs barking,\u201d said co-author Holly Jones, a conservation biologist at Northern Illinois University.",
      "Prairie dogs are often thought of as \u201cenvironmental engineers,\u201d she said, because they construct extensive burrows and nibble down prairie grass, keeping short-grass ecosystems intact.",
      "\u201cBut now we are realizing they are also shaping the ecosystems by producing and spreading information,\u201d she said.",

This book collection goes \"all the way back to the physical copy that was scanned by the institutions that actually collected those items,\u201d he said.",
      "Before ChatGPT sparked a commercial AI frenzy, most AI researchers didn\u2019t think much about the provenance of the passages of text they pulled from Wikipedia, from social media forums like Reddit and sometimes from deep repositories of pirated books.

      "Harvard\u2019s new AI training collection has an estimated 242 billion tokens, an amount that's hard for humans to fathom but it's still just a drop of what's being fed into the most advanced AI systems. Facebook parent company Meta, for instance, has said the latest version of its AI large language model was trained on more than 30 trillion tokens pulled from text, images and videos.",

      "\u201cOpenAI had this interest in massive amounts of training data. We have an interest in massive amounts of digital objects. So this is kind of just a case that things are aligning,\u201d Chapel said.",
      "Digitization is expensive. It\u2019s been painstaking work, for instance, for Boston's library to scan and curate dozens of New England\u2019s French-language newspapers that were widely read in the late 19th and early 20th century by Canadian immigrant communities from Quebec. Now that such text is of use as training data, it helps bankroll projects that librarians want to do anyway.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a public library,\u2019\" Chapel said. \u201cOur collections are held for public use, and anything we digitized as part of this project will be made public.\u201d",
      "Harvard's collection was already digitized starting in 2006 for another tech giant, Google, in its controversial project to create a searchable online library of more than 20 million books.",
      "Google spent years beating back legal challenges from authors to its online book library, which included many newer and copyrighted works. It was finally settled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "Now, for the first time, Google has worked with Harvard to retrieve public domain volumes from Google Books and clear the way for their release to AI developers. Copyright protections in the U.S. typically last for 95 years, and longer for sound recordings.",
      "How useful all of this will be for the next generation of AI tools remains to be seen as the data gets shared Thursday on the Hugging Face platform, which hosts datasets and open-source AI models that anyone can download.",
      "The book collection is more linguistically diverse than typical AI data sources. Fewer than half the volumes are in English, though European languages still dominate, particularly German, French, Italian, Spanish and Latin.",
      "A book collection steeped in 19th century thought could also be \u201cimmensely critical\u201d for the tech industry's efforts to build AI agents that can plan and reason as well as humans, Leppert said.",
      "\u201cAt a university, you have a lot of pedagogy around what it means to reason,\u201d Leppert said. \u201cYou have a lot of scientific information about how to run processes and how to run analyses.\u201d",
      "At the same time, there's also plenty of outdated data, from debunked scientific and medical theories to racist narratives.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with such a large data set, there are some tricky issues around harmful content and language,\" said Kristi Mukk, a coordinator at Harvard's Library Innovation Lab who said the initiative is trying to provide guidance about mitigating the risks of using the data, to \u201chelp them make their own informed decisions and use AI responsibly.\u201d",

      "MILAN -- A salvage company expects to lift the wreck of the luxury Bayesian yacht in late June from the seafloor off Sicily where it sank last summer, killing seven people, according to a recovery plan agreed with Italian maritime and investigating authorities, the TMC salvage company said Wednesday.",
      "Salvage teams in the past week have recovered 17 pieces of suspected Bayesian debris from the sea floor identified using a remote-controlled submersible. They have been transferred to shore in Termini Imerese as part of the investigation.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "Several days before the 56-meter (183-foot) long 473-ton yacht is lifted to the surface, crews will use precision tools to remove the 72-meter mast. After that, the Bayesian will be set upright and then gradually lifted to the surface with eight main steel lifting strops that will be installed under the hull. The whole process is expected to take several days.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, which is on the seafloor at a depth of about 49 meters (160 feet.) The operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later, and the new recovery plan was approved on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe salvage teams will now hopefully be able to make more systematic progress in preparations for the ultimate safe recovery of Bayesian, whilst ensuring the safety of those working on this very complex lifting and recovery operation,\u2019\u2019 said Marcus Cave, a TMC Marine director.",
      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch\u2019s acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June. Fifteen people survived the accident.",

      "Czech President Petr Pavel has sworn in a new justice minister amid a political crisis caused by a bitcoin-related scandal",
      "PRAGUE -- Czech President Petr Pavel swore in a new justice minister on Tuesday, another step in a political crisis caused by a bitcoin-related scandal.",
      "Pavel appointed Eva Decroix after her predecessor Pavel Bla\u017eek resigned from the post on May 30. He was under fire from the opposition because his ministry accepted a donation of bitcoins and sold them for almost 1 billion Czech koruna ($46 million) earlier this year.",
      "Bla\u017eek said that he wasn\u2019t aware of any wrongdoing, but didn\u2019t want the four-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala to be harmed by the scandal. Fiala said that he appreciated his resignation and believed that Bla\u017eek acted with goodwill.",
      "Bla\u017eek was a close ally of Fiala in the government and also in his conservative Civic Democratic Party. The new minister is from the same party.",
      "Decroix said she will order an independent probe into the ministry\u2019s activities in the case.",
      "\u201cThe public trust in the institutions and the state is at stake,\u201d Pavel said.",
      "The issue focused on the fact that the bitcoins were donated to the ministry by a person who was previously convicted of drug dealing and other crimes while it was not clear why he did it.",
      "The opposition has accused Bla\u017eek of possible money laundering, because it wasn\u2019t clear where the bitcoins originated.",
      "The opposition parties demand the resignation of the entire government and are planning to request a parliamentary no-confidence vote. It could take place later in June.",
      "The issue has been investigated by the national police's organized crime unit.",
      "The scandal is taking place just months before the Oct 3-4 parliamentary election. The main opposition ANO (YES) party led by former populist Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 is predicted to win the vote.",

      "Satellite photos show emperor penguins in one region of Antarctica declined 22% in the past 15 years",
      "WASHINGTON -- The population of emperor penguins in one part of Antarctica appears to be declining faster than previously thought, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday.",
      "The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that's shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It's unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said.",
      "\u201cSea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,\u201d said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data.",
      "Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,\u201d said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they're detected in a single satellite photo taken each year.",
      "The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds.",
      "\u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell.",
      "Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.",

      "The red fox is such a fixture of life in London that it has its own ambulance service",
      "PADDOCK WOOD, England -- The injured fox is cornered in a cage, teeth bared and snarling at the woman trying to help it.",
      "Nicki Townsend is unfazed. Wearing only rubber gloves and an outfit suitable for a yoga class, she approaches with soothing words. \u201cAll right, baby,\" she coos as she deftly drapes a towel over his head, grabs him by the scruff of his neck, scoops up his wounded legs and moves him to a clean cage.",
      "It\u2019s not the way her day typically begins, but there\u2019s nothing routine about rescuing foxes.",
      "\u201cYou can never predict what you\u2019re going to arrive at,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "While not as visible as phone boxes or double-decker buses, the red fox is a fixture in London, a city not known for its wildlife. But living on the streets, alleys and back gardens of a dense urban environment can be rough and when foxes need help, they have their own ambulance service \u2014 and Townsend may be on her way.",
      "The foxes didn't invade London so much as adapt and expand their range inward as the city spread to their habitat in the 1930s and suburbs grew.",
      "But people and the bushy-tailed member of the canine family have not always lived in harmony, and the species has admirers and adversaries.",
      "For everyone enchanted seeing a fox trotting nonchalantly down their street at dusk or basking in a sunny backyard, there are plenty who see them as pests. They poop where they like, tear into garbage and the vixens in heat let out terrifying shrieks in the dead of winter when attracting a mate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like Marmite with foxes,\u201d Townsend said, referring to the food spread that is an acquired and divisive taste. \u201cYou either love them or hate them.\u201d",
      "The divide between the two camps led Trevor Williams to found what became The Fox Project nearly 35 years ago.",
      "Once a bass player in the rock group Audience that opened for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, Williams had been active in the campaign to stop fox hunting when he redirected his protection efforts to the city, where foxes were once routinely killed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the myths that have occurred over the years, there\u2019s still a lot of suspicion about what foxes might be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to bite the baby, they\u2019re going to eat the cat, they\u2019re going to run away with your husband.\u201d",
      "The project has since grown from providing information on deterring foxes to rescuing 1,400 a year, including 400 cubs, though only about half survive to be released.",
      "There are estimated to be 15,000 foxes in London. The project covers a swath of south London and its leafy suburbs while other organizations not devoted solely to foxes handle other parts of the city.",
      "While the omnivores survive on small animals, bugs and berries in the wild, they favor easily scavenged leftovers in the city and handouts that make them more dependent on humans.",
      "Their main urban menaces are cars, getting snagged in soccer nets or getting stuck in tight spaces. In their effort to get free, they often get nasty abrasions that can become infected. Many also suffer from mange, a parasitic infestation that leads to all kinds of problems.",
      "Townsend pilots her VW Caddy on city streets, highways and narrow lanes that roll through lush hills, responding to calls about injured or ill foxes or cubs that have lost their mothers.",
      "She's seen a bit of everything since her first humbling call 2 1/2 years ago when the supposedly injured fox bolted.",
      "\u201cIn my inexperience, I chased after him, which is comical because you\u2019re never going to outrun a fox,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he ran very fast and I looked silly running after him.\u201d",
      "Despite many challenging situations \u2014 she once managed to rescue a fox that lost its footing atop a fence and ended upside down at eye level with its paw lodged between boards \u2014 she's only been bitten once.",
      "Her van carries the distinctly musky scent of foxes. The odor becomes unpleasant when an anxious passenger in a litter of cubs relieves itself enroute to being delivered to a foster care pen where they will stay until being released in the wild.",
      "\u201cFeel free to open the window,\u201d said Townsend, who is accustomed to the stench. \u201cThis is a stinky job.\"",
      "On a recent day, she was dispatched to meet a heartbroken couple who found a cub with a puncture wound collapsed on their back lawn.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was asleep at first, so we went to go and have a close look because we love them,\" Charlotte English said. \u201cThen he just didn\u2019t move, so we knew something was wrong.\u201d",
      "That cub had to be put to sleep, as did the adult Townsend transferred at the start of her shift.",
      "Cubs that recover are socialized in packs of five until they mature and are then released in a rural location while the adults are freed in the neighborhoods where they were found.",
      "Given a second chance, it's not clear how well the foxes fare, because they are rarely tracked. A 2016 study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science found that rehabilitated foxes were more likely to behave as if they had been displaced when returned to their original territory. They were tracked wandering farther away, potentially exposing them to more traffic and greater stress.",
      "\u201cIt is a gap in the knowledge and there\u2019s an assumption that when you release them, they thrive and I think that that assumption needs to be challenged more,\u201d said Bryony Tolhurst, a University of Brighton honorary research fellow and lead author of the study.",
      "For Townsend, fox deaths are offset by the joy of seeing little ones venture into the unknown or an adult darting into a neighborhood it instantly recognizes.",
      "\u201cSometimes they look back and people like to romanticize that they\u2019re saying \u2018thank you,'\" she said. \"They\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re not chasing after them.\u201d",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Delgado spokesperson Barbara Waiters said responsibility for approving loans ultimately lies with federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and serious matter, but it is not the direct or indirect result of Delgado\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Waiters said.",
      "In San Francisco, the loans taken out in Brady's name are in a grace period, but still on the books. That has not been her only challenge. A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",
      "After a few weeks, Brady finally was able to sign up for a class. The professor apologized for the delay in spots opening up: The college has been struggling with fraudulent applications.",

The lawsuit comes as a biotechnology company seeks the court's approval to buy the struggling firm.",

Customers should have the right to control such deeply personal information and it cannot be sold like ordinary property, it said.",

Founded in 2006, the company also conducted health research and drug development. But it struggled to find a profitable business model since going public in 2021.

      "The companies buy bitcoin for different reasons: Some hold it as a hedge against inflation or to signal support for the cryptocurrency industry, while some firms have made using debt and stock sales to buy bitcoin their primary business strategy.",
      "\u201cThe world at large has no idea what\u2019s happening and they\u2019re in for a big shock,\u201d Dylan LeClair, an executive at the Japan-based Metaplanet, which recently went from being a budget hotel firm to a bitcoin treasury company, said at a recent crypto conference. \u201cThis is a one-way train, nothing is going to stop this.\u201d",
      "The massive increases in some firms\u2019 stock price may seem to validate LeClair\u2019s bravado, but there are plenty of warnings that a downturn in bitcoin\u2019s prices could lead to large selloffs.",

      "That\u2019s how many bitcoins owned by MicroStrategy \u2013 the undisputed goliath of bitcoin treasury companies.",
      "With nearly 3% of the total bitcoin supply, MicroStrategy owns more bitcoins than every other bitcoin treasury company combined. It also owns more bitcoin than every nation state combined, according to the tracking site bitcointreasuries.net.",
      "Now called Strategy, the software company first started buying bitcoin in 2020 with reserve cash. Now, its software business is a small part of a perpetual bitcoin-buying machine that uses a variety of strategies \u2013 like selling shares or issuing debt \u2013 to keep growing its bitcoin holdings.",
      "That\u2019s how much MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price has increased in the last five years, compared to around 1,000% gain in bitcoin and the 1,500% jump for chipmaker and stock market darling Nvidia during that same period.",

      "That\u2019s the average purchase price of bitcoin for half of the 61 publicly traded bitcoin strategy companies, excluding bitcoin mining companies and bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a recent analysis by Standard Chartered.",
      "Geoff Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.",
      "He added that bitcoin\u2019s volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price.",
      "\u201cThe question then becomes, how much pain can companies withstand before being forced to sell their BTC?\u201d Kendrick said, referring to the symbol for bitcoin.",

    "summary": "The recent shootings of lawmakers in Minnesota are part of a disturbing trend toward politically linked violence, ABC News analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "Violence has expanded its scope in recent years.",
      "The shooting of two Minnesota state lawmakers has sent shockwaves across the nation. This grim development marks a disturbing escalation: while violence is not new, its recent migration to the state and local level represents a concerning trend.",
      "Violence against public officials has been increasing in recent years, including the two recent assassination attempts in 2024 against President Donald Trump. The 2011 assassination attempt on Rep. Gabby Giffords, initially perceived as an anomaly at the time, now appears to have been a precursor to a rising tide of threats against an expanding sphere of elected officials.",
      "This trend was further highlighted in 2017 when a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, was targeted by an individual motivated by political grievances. Five people were wounded, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise, when the gunman unleashed a hail of 70 rounds.",
      "In many of these cases, investigations consistently revealed that the suspects harbored either real or perceived grievances against the politician or their political beliefs, and subsequently acted upon those grievances.",
      "A 2015 study by the U.S. Secret Service, examining attacks against the federal government, shed light on the perpetrators. It found that offenders choose their targets for reasons including retaliation, the furtherance of ideological beliefs, personal gain, or seeking fame and attention. Nearly half of these offenders exhibited evidence of fixation \u2013 an intense or obsessive preoccupation with an individual, activity, or idea. Over half had prior arrests or criminal charges, and more than half had a history of violence towards others.",
      "Furthermore, the study found, almost half communicated their intentions to others about the target or directly with their targets. A third of the offenders made threats or veiled references of harm through online postings, verbal comments, personal manifestos, letters, and other means. Only three offenders communicated threats verbally and in-person directly to their targets.",
      "The 2025 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Homeland Threat Assessment underscored these concerns, stating that \"the 2024 election cycle will be an attractive target for many adversaries.\"",
      "\"Some domestic violent extremists (DVEs) likely view a wide range of targets indirectly and directly associated with elections as viable targets for violence with the intent of instilling fear among voters, candidates, and election workers, as well as disrupting election processes leading up to and after the November election,\" the assessment added.",
      "So, why is this rise in targeted violence occurring?",
      "A June 2024 Chapman University study suggests \"declining levels of confidence in some of our most important social institutions and growing political divisions across society\" as a possible cause. The study notes a steady increase in threats against public officials since 2017, coinciding with a general rise in polarization following the 2016 presidential election. It further posits that \"the growing number of threats may represent a growing tolerance for violence among Americans and the formation of 'a culture that helps normalize their use to express certain ideas and emotions.'\"",
      "The study identifies what it says are significant obstacles to effective responses, including the blurry line between protected speech and criminal threats and the anonymity facilitated by digital technology.",
      "As the study points out, the digital age, with its access to the \"dark web,\" violent online content, and the ease with which individuals can identify public officials, their residences, and their activities, has created unprecedented targeting opportunities. This helps explain the observed increase in violence across all levels of government, including state and local officials, a trend that unfortunately appears to be continuing.",
      "For those in the public sphere, prioritizing personal protection and implementing basic security measures are crucial. These include alarm systems at home, security cameras to identify visitors, and controlling who comes into contact with them. While being a public official and ensuring safety can be conflicting and elusive goals in this climate, these fundamental steps can significantly enhance their security.",
      "Donald J. Mihalek is an ABC News contributor, retired senior Secret Service agent and regional field training instructor who served during two presidential transitions. He was also a police officer and served in the U.S. Coast Guard.",
      "Richard Frankel is an ABC News contributor and retired FBI special agent who was the special agent in charge of the FBI's Newark Division and prior to that, the FBI's New York Joint Terrorism TASK force.",

      "Klobuchar: Minnesota lawmakers \"didn't deserve this to happen to them.\"",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar mourned the two Minnesota state lawmakers shot early Saturday at their homes in what leaders are calling an \"act of targeted political violence,\" calling them \"friends\" and \"decent people\" who were simply \"trying to represent the people that they were elected to represent.\"",
      "The Minnesota Democrat told ABC News' \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that people should \"know\" the victims of political violence and threats -- in this case, state Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was killed alongside her husband, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, who underwent surgery after the attack.",
      "\"She was a true leader, and I loved her work, but was always so grounded and such a decent person. I think that's probably the best word to describe her. You look at her pictures and you know what she was about. So we miss her greatly, and so when you hear about statistics about political violence and threats, I just want people to know who we're talking about,\" Klobuchar said about Hortman.",
      "\"Or Senator Hoffman. Equally respected. Got into politics because his daughter has spina bifida and she couldn't get insurance, and he wanted to advocate for her. Decent people who didn't deserve this to happen to them,\" Klobuchar continued.",
      "Authorities have identified 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter as the suspected gunman and are continuing to search for him.",
      "Klobuchar described Hortman as an illustrious lawmaker and compassionate public servant, who began her career in public service as a mother with young children who had a background working at her father's auto parts company. Hortman easily juggled teaching Sunday school, leading a Girl Scout troop and training service dogs for veterans, Klobuchar said.",
      "The senator said she first got to know Hortman when she was a young lawmaker and she was struck with how she was able to know \"practically every person in her district.\"",
      "\"Melissa Hortman was a woman that I wish everyone around the country knew,\" Klobuchar told Raddatz. \"When you think about a true public servant who goes into it for the right reasons, it's Melissa.\"",
      "Klobuchar said that Hortman's ability to \"juggle it all\" may have contributed to the political success she'd been able to notch, especially in the past year with a divided legislature, when she worked alongside the state Senate's Republican leader to artfully negotiate a budget and avoid government shutdown.",
      "When she was the Speaker of the House, Hortman also spearheaded landmark legislation like paid family leave and free lunch for students, Klobuchar said.",
      "Klobuchar called the suspect \"evil,\" and \"smart\" on Sunday.",
      "\"He's evil. He is smart. He has killed without a second thought, and there's a $50,000 reward,\" she told Raddatz.",
      "The Minnesota Democrat lauded the cooperation between Minnesota leaders and state law enforcement.",
      "\"We couldn't be getting more help from law enforcement,\" Klobuchar said, applauding also local police officers' swift work on the ground, when they checked in on Hortman soon after getting called to Hoffman's house.",
      "\"Those local police officers at that moment not only appear to have saved [Hoffman] and his wife's life, but also had given us major leads to who he was and why he was doing this,\" Klobuchar said.",
      "Klouchar said she \"hasn't seen\" the target list written by the gunman, something that law enforcement sources say had dozens of Minnesota Democrats on it.",
      "Those on the list included Minnesota lawmakers Gov. Tim Walz, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, U.S. Sen. Tina Smith and state Attorney General Keith Ellison, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the matter.",
      "Klobuchar called political violence a \"rampant problem\" and said she \"believes\" that could have been one of the gunman's motivations for the Minnesota lawmaker shootings.",
      "\"I believe that there's some things in the manifesto that would lead you down that trail to believe that this was one of his motivating forces,\" Klobuchar said.",
      "She also highlighted the bipartisan statement against political violence that the Minnesota congressional delegation released after the shootings on Saturday.",
      "\"You speak with one voice to condemn this political violence. There's no place for this politically motivated violence in our democracy,\" Klobuchar said on Sunday. \"This is a rampant problem that the public and all of us have to deal with -- and also against judges, and all of us should condemn all of that violence,\" she said.",

      "President Donald Trump said Sunday the United States is not involved in Israel's military strikes against Iran, but \"it's possible we could get involved.\"",
      "That comes after reports that Israel had urged the U.S. to join the conflict with Iran to eliminate its nuclear program.",
      "In an interview with ABC News' Rachel Scott, Trump declined to comment on whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a personal plea for the U.S. to get more involved.",
      "\"We're not involved in it. It's possible we could get involved. But we are not at this moment involved,\" the president said.",
      "Trump also shared that he had a lengthy call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday to discuss, in large part, the conflict in the Middle East.",
      "The president told ABC News he would be \"open\" to Putin's idea to serve as a mediator between Iran and Israel.",
      "\"I would be open to it. [Putin] is ready. He called me about it. We had a long talk about it. We talked about this more than his situation. This is something I believe is going to get resolved,\" Trump stated.",
      "The president's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, was set to travel to Oman on Sunday for another round of nuclear talks with Iranian officials. But following Israel's strikes, Iran called off the meeting.

    "published": "Sun, 15 Jun 2025 15:52:44 -0400",
    "summary": "Thousands of \"No Kings Day\" protests are set to be held throughout the country on Saturday to protest the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Protests are set to take place in more than 2,000 communities around the U.S.",
      "Thousands of \"No Kings Day\" protests are set to be held throughout the country on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump's administration and to counterprogram the military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the U.S. Army's 250th birthday.",
      "Here's what to know about the protests.",
      "What is the idea behind \"No Kings Day\"?",
      "\"'No Kings Day' is the largest single-day, peaceful protest in recent American history, made up of millions of normal, everyday Americans who are showing up in more than 2,000 communities around the country to say, 'we don't do kings in America,'\" Ezra Levin, the co-executive director of progressive organizing group Indivisible, told ABC News on Thursday.",
      "Indivisible and other organizations involved with the coalition coordinating the protests have said that the protests are meant to protest what they say is overreach by the Trump administration on immigration enforcement and deportations, civil rights and cuts to the federal government.",
      "They've also pointed to how the military parade is being held on Trump's birthday. Trump has denied any connection between the parade's timing and his birthday, pointing to how June 14 is Flag Day.",
      "The groups coordinating the protests originally announced the initiatives in early May, after reports of the upcoming military parade, but organizers have said that the protests against immigration enforcement in Los Angeles and the response from the federal government have driven much more interest to the events.",
      "Where and when will the protests be?",
      "The protests will be held across the country and even beyond the United States, with a flagship event held in Philadelphia. Levin told ABC News there are now more than 2,000 events planned \"just about everywhere, everywhere but downtown D.C. -- intentionally so.\"",
      "According to Levin, the organizers did not want to give Trump a rationale to retaliate against peaceful protests in D.C. or to say that the protesters were protesting the military.",
      "\"We are ceding downtown D.C. Trump can have it for that day, and instead, we're organizing literally everywhere else,\" Levin said.",
      "Most of the protests around the country will be held in the morning, ahead of the parade. Some in the western part of the country may occur concurrently with the parade, which is set to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET.",
      "What has Trump said about the protests?",
      "Asked on Thursday about his thoughts on the \"No Kings\" protests planned across the country for Saturday, Trump said he did not feel like a king.",
      "\"I don't feel like a king. I have to go through hell to get stuff approved,\" he said.",
      "\"A king would say, 'I'm not gonna get this'... he wouldn't have to call up Mike Johnson and Thune and say, 'Fellas, you got to pull this off' and after years we get it done. No, no, we're not a king, we're not a king at all,\" he added, referencing the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate Majority leader, respectively.",
      "Trump, on Tuesday, had threatened to use \"heavy force\" against \"any\" protesters at the military parade in the nation's capital; White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said that \"of course\" the president supports peaceful protestors. Organizers of the No Kings protests have continuously emphasized they are not planning protests in Washington.",
      "Are there safety concerns surrounding the protests?",
      "Organizers have emphasized that the protests should remain peaceful and nonviolent, pointing to various trainings they've held this week about safety and deescalation.",
      "Levin said there were some concerns about outside agitators trying to disrupt protests, but he said people shouldn't feel \"as if we're going into battle. That's not what this is about. This is peaceful protest. People are going to have funny signs, people are going to be dancing, people are going to be chanting, people are going to be expressing their First Amendment rights.\"",
      "At Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's recommendation, all \"No Kings\" events not already underway were canceled due to \"the individual who assassinated a Democratic lawmaker\" still being at large, according to the \"No Kings\" website.",
      "At least two states, Texas and Missouri, have said they are calling up the National Guard in their states as a precaution against the potential for any violence at protests on Saturday. The governors of both states affirmed that peaceful protests are legal.",
      "Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Ericka Miller told ABC News that the Capitol and Capitol grounds were evacuated at 1 p.m. local time due to a \"credible threat against state lawmakers planning to attend\" the No Kings protest. The event was supposed to begin at 5 p.m.",
      "\"We are working to address the threat,\" Miller said.",
      "What comes next?",
      "The events on Saturday are not meant to be the be-all end-all of the groups' efforts to protest the Trump administration, Levin said.",
      "\"I think sometimes folks think a protest has to be everything. It's got to solve all your problems ... We need persistent, peaceful, people-powered organizing them on the ground in blue states, red states and purple states that allow people to push back against the escalating overreach from this administration,\" Levin said.",
      "ABC News' Hannah Demissie, Lalee Ibssa and Kelsey Walsh contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Ahead of President Trump's military parade, a transgender service member who was barred from the military, reflects on \"patriotism\" and her fight against the ban.",
    "story": [
      "As the U.S. military prepares to celebrate the legacy of the Army with a massive parade in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, some transgender service members are grappling with an involuntary end to their careers after the Trump administration banned them from the military.",
      "\"I'm heartbroken,\" said Cmdr. Emily Shilling, a decorated Navy pilot who is also the lead plaintiff in Shilling vs. Trump -- one of three federal lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's executive order barring transgender service members.",
      "Shilling, who is based in the D.C. area, is also the president of Sparta Pride -- an organization advocating for 2,400 transgender people in the military and those who hope to join.",
      "Reflecting on the upcoming parade commemorating the 250th anniversary of the Army's founding, Shilling, who has served since 2005, told ABC News that \"military might does not equal patriotism.\"",
      "\"The members who take an oath and dedicate their lives to service -- that's patriotism, whether or not we have tanks or rocket launchers, that has nothing to do with it,\" Shilling said.",
      "And according to Shilling, for active duty members of Sparta, who were faced with the \"heartbreaking\" decision to voluntarily separate from the military or get kicked out, abandoning their commitment to serving their country is what's \"keeping them up at night.\"",
      "\"When I sit in these town halls that we do with Sparta, people are really struggling with the idea of giving up or quitting, or, you know, not fulfilling their oath,\" she said. \"And that's actually what's keeping these men, women and folks you know, up at night. They feel like they have a duty to keep serving and keep fighting.\"",
      "The Pentagon's new ban went into effect in early May shortly after the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could enforce the ban on transgender people in the military while legal challenges proceed in lower courts.",
      "After the Supreme Court ruling, the Pentagon issued a memo giving active duty service members until June 6 -- last Friday -- to self-identify and begin the voluntary separation process. Transgender service members in the reserve forces have until July 7 to voluntarily separate.",
      "The memo also stated that after June 6, military commanders will be told to identify people in their units who have a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria. The move would initiate a referral to an annual health check-up that would begin what could be a lengthy process for each individual that could lead to their removal from the military.",
      "Shilling, who will be eligible for retirement at 20 years in September, told ABC News that faced with these options, she chose to self-identify and begin the process of voluntarily separating from the military, but noted that she made the decision \"under duress.\"",
      "\"I hit my retirement date in September. So if I didn't volunteer at that time, I could theoretically be kicked out between June and September and lose everything,\" she said. \"So it was very much a decision made under duress. You know, I was coerced into it because we knew that the voluntary separation would give me an honorable discharge with some portion of my retirement, and I'd be able to keep all of my benefits.\"",
      "The Pentagon incentivized service members with gender dysphoria to voluntarily separate ahead of the June 6 deadline by offering benefit payment packages that would be more than double what would be received if they were to separate involuntarily. Those who voluntarily separated would not have to risk paying back the recruitment or retention bonuses they may have earned during their military service.",
      "Its policy came after the Trump administration announced a ban on transgender service members in a Jan. 27 executive order, where President Donald Trump directed the Defense Department to revise the policy allowing transgender troops to openly serve.",
      "\"Expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service,\" the order said.",
      "The order further argued that receiving gender-affirming medical care is one of the conditions that is physically and mentally \"incompatible with active duty.\"",
      "Defense officials estimate that as of last December, about 4,240 current active-duty, National Guard and Reserve service members had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "There are more than 2.1 million military service members serving on active-duty, National Guard and the Reserves. Advocacy groups have put the actual number of transgender service members as being much higher, at around 15,000.",
      "\"There's a lot of fear,\" Shilling said, reflecting on service members like herself who are losing their jobs.",
      "She also said that being banned from the military has taken an emotional toll on the community -- some of whom have left \"rough homes\" and found a family in the military.",
      "\"For a lot of people, this was, you know, the dream they've always wanted, and now their family is saying, you're not good enough. They're being rejected again by another family,\" she said. \"And that's pretty brutal.\"",
      "When asked how she feels about her decision to voluntarily separate from the military, Shilling said that she is at \"peace\" because she knows that the fight is not over.",
      "\"I'm at peace,\" she said. \"I'm going to thrive, and I'm going to be able to fight this \u2026 and continue to fight for that America that I believe in -- that good, righteous America, and a lot of these service members feel very much the same.\"",

      "California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla has continued to defend himself and refute claims by the Trump administration that he \"crashed\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference before federal officers shoved him outside the room, pushed him to the floor and handcuffed him.",
      "Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, provided more details about the incident Thursday night during an interview on MSNBC -- in which he said he was not a threat and had merely raised his voice to ask a question.",
      "The senator claimed he did not barge into the news conference, as alleged by Noem, but rather he was in the federal building for an approved scheduled briefing with representatives of the Northern Command. He said that meeting was delayed by Noem's news conference in a nearby room, where she was discussing the administration's use of the National Guard to respond to protests over President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.",
      "Padilla said he decided to go to listen to Noem's news conference and asked the National Guard member and FBI agent escorting with him if he could go.",
      "\"We're, the whole time, being escorted in this federal building by somebody from the National Guard, somebody from the FBI. I've gone through screening. This is a federal building. And so, I tell them, 'Let's go listen to the press conference.' They escort me over to that room,\" Padilla told MSNBC.",
      "\"The folks that were escorting me in the building walked me over. I didn't even open the door. The door was opened for me. And I spent a few minutes in the back of the room just listening in until the rhetoric, the political rhetoric got to be too much to take. So, I spoke up,\" he later added.",
      "During her news conference, Noem claimed she was going to \"liberate\" Los Angeles \"from the socialists and the burdensome leadership this governor and mayor have placed on this country and this city.\"",
      "Padilla told MSNBC that he felt he needed to speak out, said he introduced himself and started asking a question before the officers pushed him out of the room as news cameras, reporters and onlookers recorded the incident.",
      "Noem said law enforcement reacted as they did because Padilla came toward her without identifying himself. She told Fox News Thursday that no one knew who he was and that he was \"lunging forward.\"",
      "Video of the incident captures Padilla identifying himself and saying he wanted to ask a question as he is pushed out of the room; it's not clear from the video if he identified himself before that point, including as he came forward toward the podium. Padilla was wearing a navy blue polo shirt with a small U.S. Senate logo, but it was covered under a navy blue jacket. He said he was not wearing a U.S. Senate security pin at the time of the incident.",
      "After he was quickly released, he and Noem had a private conversation for \"10-15 minutes\" after the incident, according to both the senator and the secretary.",
      "Noem said that Padilla will likely not be charged.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday said Padilla should be \"ashamed of his childish behavior.\"",
      "\"He crashed the middle of an official press conference being held by a cabinet secretary, recklessly lunged toward the podium where @Sec_Noem was speaking, and then refused to leave the room and follow the directions of law enforcement officers,\" Leavitt posted to X.",
      "Outraged Democratic senators quickly came to Padilla's defense Thursday, claiming Noem and the officers mistreated the senator.",
      "\"This is an administration that has no respect for our democracy, for our institutions, for the separation of powers, for a co-equal branch of government,\" California Sen. Adam Schiff said.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told reporters, \"I've seen that one clip. It is horrible. It is shocking at every level. It's not the America I know.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans chastised Padilla, with Johnson going so far as saying censure might be needed. A vote to censure does not hold any power beyond a public condemnation of the member's behavior and it does not deny the member privileges.",
      "Sen. Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Thursday evening that he had spoken with Padilla and the Senate Sergeant At Arms and had attempted to reach Noem in an effort to gather the facts.",
      "\"We want to get the full scope of what happened and do what we would do in any incident like this involving a senator, that is, try to gather all of the relevant information,\" he said.",

      "A growing number of Spaniards are souring on the country's highly successful tourism industry which is being blamed for a stubborn housing crisis",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- In Barcelona's residential Gr\u00e0cia neighborhood known for its quaint squares, Txema Escorsa feels he is being left behind.",
      "The friendly faces of neighbors in his apartment building have been replaced by a non-stop flow of hard-partying foreigners, and his teacher's salary can't keep pace with the rising rent.",
      "\"It is tough for me to imagine what to do next,\u201d he told The Associated Press in the living room of his two-bedroom apartment. \u201cIf I leave, will I be contributing to Barcelona losing its essence that comes from its locals? But there comes a time when I'm fed up.\u201d",
      "Escorsa, 33, is just one of many residents who believe tourism has gone too far in the city famed for Antoni Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade, running roughshod over communities and exacerbating a housing crisis.",
      "It's not just a Spanish problem. Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with overtourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Barcelona, where protesters plan to take to the streets on Sunday.",
      "Similar demonstrations are slated in several other Spanish cities, including on the Balearic islands of Mallorca and Ibiza, as well as in the Italian postcard city of Venice, Portugal's capital Lisbon and other cities across southern Europe \u2014 marking the first time a protest against tourism has been coordinated across the region.",
      "A poll in June 2022 found just 2% of Spaniards thought housing was a national problem. Three years later, almost a third of those surveyed said it is now a leading concern. (Both polls were of 4,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6%)",
      "Spaniards have staged several large protests in Barcelona, Madrid and other cities in recent years to demand lower rents. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Last year, Barcelona seemed to reach a tipping point when a rally in favor of \u201cdegrowing tourism\u201d ended with some protestors shooting water pistols at unsuspecting tourists. Images of those incidents went around the world, and more such scenes are expected on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt is very likely the water pistols will be back,\" said Daniel Pardo, one of the organizers of the Barcelona protest. \"In fact, we encourage people to bring their own.\u201d",

      "Spain's municipal and federal authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry and are taking appropriate action to put the tourism industry on notice, despite the fact it contributes 12% of national GDP.",
      "Almost two-thirds of those who took part in a poll conducted last year in Barcelona said tourist apartments led to bothersome behavior. Two months later, the city stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "A survey by Spain's public opinion office last year showed more than three-quarters of respondents favored tighter regulations on tourist apartments. Spain\u2019s left-wing government approved regulations making it easier for owners of apartments to block others from renting to tourists in their building, as well as approving measures to allow cities like Barcelona to cap rents. And last month, it ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules.",

      "The resulting Juneteenth holiday \u2014 it's name combining \u201cJune\u201d and \u201cnineteenth\u201d \u2014 has only grown in one-and-a-half centuries. In 2021, President Joe Biden designated it a federal holiday \u2014 expanding its recognition beyond Black America.",
      "This year will be the first Juneteenth under President Donald Trump's second administration, which has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government. This has included removing Black American history content from federal websites. Trump officials have also discouraged some federal agencies from recognizing other racial heritage celebrations.",
      "Still, many people anticipate getting Juneteenth off work. There are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events planned throughout the week leading into the holiday. But with the current political climate, some may wonder if their company will honor it.",
      "\u201cI don't think anyone should be intimidated or obligated into not celebrating the day,\u201d said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. \u201cI've not heard of anyone being denied. I think it would be absolutely reprehensible.\u201d",
      "People who never gave the occasion more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \u201cright\u201d way to celebrate Juneteenth?",
      "For beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:",
      "It depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and picnics. Originally celebrated as Black Americans\u2019 true Independence Day, outdoor events allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \u201cBlack Codes,\u201d enforced in Confederate states. Codes controlled whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.",
      "Last year, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.",
      "Plans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided, according to the White House press office.",
      "Others may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing everyone should do is be able to quickly answer the question \u2018What is Juneteenth?\u2019\u201d Morial said.",
      "Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn\u2019t learn about it until his 30s.",
      "\u201cI think many folks haven\u2019t known about it \u2014 who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn\u2019t celebrate it,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt was like just a part of history. It wasn\u2019t a celebration of history.\u201d",
      "For many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn\u2019t have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.",
      "Search online and you will find gatherings nationwide varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you\u2019ll likely find information on health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black creativity. There will also be panels to educate about Juneteenth\u2019s history.",
      "The National Park Service is again making entry into all sites free on the holiday, according to its website.",
      "The red, black and green African Liberation Flag, also known as the Pan-African flag, has historically been displayed at both Black History Month and Juneteenth celebrations. Red represents bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. Black symbolizes Black people. Green represents richness of the land in Africa.",
      "More people, however, have leaned into the Juneteenth flag created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith, who founded the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. Like the American flag, it is red, white and blue to indicate those freed are also Americans. The five-point white star in the middle is a tribute to Juneteenth's birthplace of Texas. It is encircled by another white starry line that represents the spreading of freedom.",
      "Aside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.",
      "In recent years, Juneteenth has become more commercialized with national chains selling Juneteenth party supplies, T-shirts and other merchandise. However, this year, Juneteenth items appear to be fewer or only online. Morial says he would be disappointed if companies decided selling Juneteenth items out in the open was too risky because of politics. At the same time, it might be a good opportunity for consumers.",
      "\u201cI would also encourage people to go online and look for an African American vendor,\u201d Morial said. \u201cIf you got to participate in that (commercialism), that's what I would do.\u201d",
      "Dr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there\u2019s no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you\u2019re not Black. In fact, embrace it.",
      "\u201cI would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn\u2019t this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\u201d",
      "Over the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.",
      "\u201cBecause 1776, Fourth of July, where we\u2019re celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBlack people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s typical to wish people a \u201cHappy Juneteenth\u201d or \u201cHappy Teenth,\u201d according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organized a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island. The day after he will host a stand-up comedy and jazz show at his Houston restaurant and lounge, the Frisky Whisky.",

Records show Boelter registered to vote as a Republican while living in Oklahoma in 2004 before moving to Minnesota where voters don\u2019t list party affiliation.",
      "Near the scene at Hortman\u2019s home, authorities say they found an SUV made to look like those used by law enforcement. Inside they found fliers for a local anti-Trump \u201cNo Kings\u201d rally scheduled for Saturday and a notebook with names of other lawmakers. The list also included the names of abortion rights advocates and health care officials, according to two law enforcement officials who could not discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.",
      "Both Hortman and Hoffman were defenders of abortion rights at the state legislature.",
      "Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said at a briefing on Sunday that Boelter is not believed to have made any public threats before the attacks. Evans asked the public not to speculate on a motivation for the attacks. \u201cWe often want easy answers for complex problems,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThose answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation.\u201d",
      "Friends told the AP that they knew Boelter was religious and conservative, but that he didn't talk about politics often and didn't seem extreme.",
      "\"He was right-leaning politically but never fanatical, from what I saw, just strong beliefs,\u201d said Paul Schroeder, who has known Boelter for years.",
      "Boelter, who worked as a security contractor, gave a glimpse of his beliefs on abortion during a trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2023. While there, Boelter served as an evangelical pastor, telling people he had first found Jesus as a teenager.",
      "\u201cThe churches are so messed up, they don\u2019t know abortion is wrong in many churches,\u201d he said, according to an online recording of one sermon from February 2023. Still, in three lengthy sermons reviewed by the AP, he only mentioned abortion once, focusing more on his love of God and what he saw as the moral decay in his native country.",
      "He appears to have hidden his more strident beliefs from his friends back home.",
      "\u201cHe never talked to me about abortion,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cIt seemed to be just that he was a conservative Republican who naturally followed Trump.\u201d",
      "A married father with five children, Boelter and his wife own a sprawling 3,800-square-foot house on a large rural lot about an hour from downtown Minneapolis that the couple bought in 2023 for more than a half-million dollars.",
      "He worked for decades in managerial roles for food and beverage manufacturers before seeking to reinvent himself in middle age, according to resumes and a video he posted online.",
      "After getting an undergraduate degree in international relations in his 20s, Boelter went back to school and earned a master\u2019s degree and then a doctorate in leadership studies in 2016 from Cardinal Stritch University, a private Catholic college in Wisconsin that has since shut down. While living in Wisconsin, records show Boelter and his wife Jenny founded a nonprofit corporation called Revoformation Ministries, listing themselves as the president and secretary.",
      "After moving to Minnesota about a decade ago, Boelter volunteered for a position on a state workforce development board, first appointed by then-Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, in 2016, and later by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. He served through 2023.",
      "In that position, he may have crossed paths with one of his alleged victims. Hoffman served on the same board, though authorities said it was not immediately clear how much the two men may have interacted.",
      "Records show Boelter and his wife started a security firm in 2018. A website for Praetorian Guard Security Services lists Boelter\u2019s wife as the president and CEO while he is listed as the director of security patrols. The company\u2019s homepage says it provides armed security for property and events and features a photo of an SUV painted in a two-tone black and silver pattern similar to a police vehicle, with a light bar across the roof and \u201cPraetorian\u201d painted across the doors. Another photo shows a man in black tactical gear with a military-style helmet and a ballistic vest with the company\u2019s name across the front.",
      "In an online resume, Boelter also billed himself as a security contractor who worked oversees in the Middle East and Africa. On his trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, he told Chris Fuller, a friend, that he had founded several companies focused on farming and fishing on the Congo River, as well as in transportation and tractor sales.",
      "\u201cIt has been a very fun and rewarding experience and I only wished I had done something like this 10 years ago,\u201d he wrote in a message shared with the AP.",
      "But once he returned home in 2023, there were signs that Boelter was struggling financially. That August, he began working for a transport service for a funeral home, mostly picking up bodies of those who had died in assisted living facilities \u2014 a job he described as he needed to do to pay bills. Tim Koch, the owner of Metro First Call, said Boelter \u201cvoluntarily left\u201d that position about four months ago.",
      "\u201cThis is devastating news for all involved,\u201d Koch said, declining to elaborate on the reasons for Boelter\u2019s departure, citing the ongoing law enforcement investigation.",
      "Boelter had also started spending some nights away from his family, renting a room in a modest house in northern Minneapolis shared by friends. Heavily armed police executed a search warrant on the home Saturday.",
      "In the hours before Saturday\u2019s shootings, Boelter texted two roommates to tell them he loved them and that \u201cI\u2019m going to be gone for a while,\u201d according to Schroeder, who was forwarded the text and read it to the AP.",
      "\u201cMay be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn\u2019t gone this way,\u201d Boelter wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything more and implicate you in any way because you guys don\u2019t know anything about this. But I love you guys and I\u2019m sorry for the trouble this has caused.\u201d",

      "FBI officials say two detainees who escaped from a federal immigration detention center in New Jersey last week have been recaptured, while another two remain at large",
      "NEWARK, N.J. -- Two detainees who escaped from a federal immigration detention center in New Jersey last week have been recaptured, while another two remain at large, FBI officials said Sunday.",
      "The four men busted out of the Delaney Hall detention center in Newark during reports of disorder there by breaking through an interior wall that led to an exterior one, and were able to escape from a parking lot, according to U.S. Sen. Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, and Homeland Security officials.",
      "The FBI said Joel Enrique Sandoval-Lopez and Joan Sebastian Castaneda-Lozada were taken back into custody since Friday, while Franklin Norberto Bautista-Reyes and Andres Felipe Pineda-Mogollon were still on the lam. Officials did not immediately say how or where the two who are back in custody were caught. All four men were in the country illegally and had previously been charged with crimes by local police in New Jersey and New York City, Homeland Security officials said.",
      "Sandoval-Lopez, from Honduras, was charged with unlawful possession of a handgun in October and aggravated assault in February, officials said. Castaneda-Lozada, from Colombia, was charged with burglary, theft and conspiracy, authorities said.",
      "Bautista-Reyes, from Honduras, was charged in May with aggravated assault, attempt to cause bodily injury, terroristic threats and a weapon crime. Pineda-Mogollon, from Colombia, was charged with minor larceny and burglary crimes. The FBI has announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of each man.",
      "A spokesperson for the New Jersey public defenders' office, which represented Sandoval-Lopez, did not immediately return an email seeking comment Sunday. Attorney information for the other three men could not be located on online court records.",
      "Newark\u2019s mayor, Ras Baraka, a Democrat who\u2019s been critical of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, cited reports of a possible uprising and escape after disorder broke out at the facility Thursday night and protesters outside the center locked arms and pushed against barricades as vehicles passed through gates. Much is still unclear about what unfolded there.",
      "But GEO Group, the company that owns and operates the detention facility for the federal government, said in a statement that there was \u201cno widespread unrest\u201d at the facility.",
      "Delaney Hall has been the site of clashes this year between Democratic officials who say the facility needs more oversight and the Trump administration and those who run the facility.",
      "Baraka was arrested May 9, handcuffed and charged with trespassing. The charge was later dropped and U.S. Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver was later charged with assaulting federal officers stemming from a skirmish that happened outside the facility. She has denied the charges.",

      "A man who was believed to be part of a peacekeeping team for the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest in Salt Lake City shot at a person who was brandishing a rifle at demonstrators, striking both the rifleman and a bystander who later died at the hospital, authorities said Sunday.",
      "Police took the alleged rifleman, Arturo Gamboa, 24, into custody Saturday evening on a murder charge, Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said at a Sunday news conference. The bystander was Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, 39, a fashion designer from Samoa.",
      "Detectives don't yet know why Gamboa pulled out a rifle or ran from the peacekeepers, but they accused him of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo's death. The Associated Press did not immediately find an attorney listed for Gamboa or contact information for his family in public records.",
      "Redd said the man believed to be part of the peacekeeping team, dressed in a neon green vest, fired three shots from a handgun at Gamboa, inflicting a relatively minor injury but fatally shooting Ah Loo. Redd did not share the man's name.",
      "Volunteer peacekeeping teams are common for protests, said Sarah Parker, a national coordinator for 50501 Movement, which was a partner in the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest. But the organizers ask attendees, including the peacekeepers, not to bring weapons, she said. Still, Parker said they stopped what could've been a larger mass casualty event.",
      "\u201cOur safety team did as best as they could in a situation that is extremely sad and extremely scary,\" said Parker.",
      "Ah Loo, known as Afa, was a husband and father to two children and a fashion designer who leaned into his Samoan heritage, according to a GoFundMe page organized to support his family. Ah Loo founded Creative Pacific, an event celebrating the diversity of the Pacific Islands, with workshops, artists and a fashion runway. He was on Season 17 of the fashion design reality TV show \u201cProject Runway.\u201d",
      "The gunshots sent hundreds of protesters running, some hiding behind barriers and fleeing into parking garages and nearby businesses, police said in a statement. \u201cThat's a gun. Come on, come on, get out,\" someone can be heard saying in a video posted to social media that appears to show the events.",
      "\u201cNo Kings\u201d protests swept across the country on Saturday, and organizers said millions rallied against what they described as President Donald Trump's authoritarian tendencies.",
      "Confrontations were largely isolated. In Riverside, California, authorities said a driver of an SUV struck a woman who was participating in a demonstration and sped away. The woman had \u201csignificant injuries\u201d but was stable, police said, adding that they were still searching for the driver.",
      "Outside the Arizona statehouse, a social media video showed protesters Saturday jeering at and then skirmishing with a masked man, who eventually pulled out a handgun, causing the crowd to scatter. Another video showed Arizona Department of Public Safety officers taking the man into custody.",
      "The shooter and another person in a neon vest allegedly saw Gamboa separate from the crowd of marchers in downtown Salt Lake City, move behind a wall and withdraw a rifle around 8 p.m., Redd said.",
      "When the two men in vests confronted Gamboa with their handguns drawn, witnesses said Gamboa raised his rifle into a firing position and ran toward the crowd, said Redd.",
      "That's when one of the men dressed in the vests shot three rounds, hitting Gamboa and Ah Loo, said Redd. Gamboa, who police said didn't have a criminal history, was wounded and treated before being booked into jail.",
      "Redd said that the peacekeepers\u2019 actions are also part of the investigation.",
      "Police said they recovered an AR-15 style rifle, a gas mask and a backpack at the scene.",

      "Flash flooding caused by torrential rains killed five people in northern West Virginia and rescue crews were searching for three other people who were missing Sunday as authorities assessed damage to roads, bridges, natural gas lines and other infrastructure.",
      "Officials said 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of Wheeling and Ohio County within about a half hour on Saturday night.",
      "\u201cWe almost immediately started getting 911 calls for rescue of people being trapped,\u201d Lou Vargo, Ohio County's emergency management director, said at a news conference Sunday. \u201cDuring this time, we had major infrastructure damage to roads, bridges, and highways where we couldn't respond to a lot of incidents. So we were delayed in getting there because there was just so much damage.\"",
      "Vargo added: \u201cIt happened so quickly and so fast. \u2026 I\u2019ve been doing this for 35 years. I\u2019ve seen major floods here in the city and the county. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d",
      "Authorities said vehicles were swept into swollen creeks, some people sought safety in trees and a mobile home caught fire.",
      "Similarly, swift flash flooding arrived in Marion County, south of Wheeling and Ohio County, early Sunday afternoon, causing extensive damage to bridges, roads and some homes, the county's Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Management said in a Facebook post. The county's 911 line has already processed at least 165 calls for service since the storms began.",
      "Gov. Patrick Morrisey declared a state of emergency in Marion County Sunday evening.",
      "Jim Blazier, the fire chief in Wheeling in the state\u2019s northern panhandle, said crews performed rescue operations into Sunday's early morning hours. He said first responders regrouped Sunday morning and were focused on an area from the Ohio state line across the Ohio River to Wheeling Creek.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re searching the banks, we\u2019re searching submerged vehicles, any debris we find along the trail and so forth,\u201d Blazier said. \u201cWe\u2019re using drones, search dogs and swift water personnel, and we have teams organized that are searching sectors that we\u2019re trying to recover anybody that\u2019s missing.\u201d",
      "There were about 2,500 reported power outages in the county Sunday, Morrisey confirmed in a news release Sunday evening, which updated the number of people confirmed dead to five, with three more missing. He has declared a state of emergency in Ohio County and mobilized the National Guard to support emergency operations.",
      "\"In many respects, this is kind of a unicorn event, because a lot of the rain had very narrow areas and there were roughly 3 to 4 inches of water that fell in the area in less than an hour,\" Morrisey said at a press conference earlier Sunday. \"That\u2019s very, very difficult to deal with.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cYour friends, your neighbors, your first responders and people in the community, they\u2019re out working very hard to find people. That\u2019s our No. 1 task right now, trying to identify anyone who may still be out there.\u201d",
      "The West Virginia rains followed heavy downpours in San Antonio on Thursday that killed 13 people. More than 7 inches (18 centimeters) of rain fell over a span of hours in the Texas city, causing fast-rising floodwaters to carry more than a dozen cars into a creek.",

      "BELLE PLAINE, Minn. -- Authorities searched a vehicle on a rural road outside Minneapolis on Sunday that they believe had been used by the man wanted in the shootings of two Democratic lawmakers, as a state on edge struggled to make sense of the brazen political violence that left one leader dead.",
      "Former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were killed in their Brooklyn Park home early Saturday. Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were injured at their Champlin home, about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away.",
      "Authorities named 57-year-old Vance Boelter as a suspect, saying he wore a mask as he posed as a police officer, even allegedly altering a vehicle to make it look like a police car.",
      "More than 24 hours after authorities first confronted him outside Hortman's home, Boelter was still on the loose after fleeing on foot. The FBI issued a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest and conviction. They circulated a photo taken Saturday of Boelter wearing a tan cowboy hat and asked the public to report sightings.",
      "Investigators found a cowboy hat near the vehicle and were working to determine whether it belongs to Boelter. Law enforcement officers were searching the area, including nearby homes. The officials could not discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "The search was happening in rural Sibley County, roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Minneapolis, where Boelter had a home with his wife and five children. Residents in the area received an emergency alert about the located vehicle that warned them to lock their doors and cars.",
      "A crowd of officers were seen congregated on a dirt road near the abandoned dark sedan believed to have been used by Boelter. Doors on both sides of the car were splayed open, with discarded items scattered near the vehicle. Some officers broke off and walked into a wooded area off the road. The car was later towed away.",
      "\u201cWe believe he\u2019s somewhere in the vicinity and that they are going to find him,\u201d U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cBut right now, everyone\u2019s on edge here, because we know that this man will kill at a second.\u201d",
      "The shootings come as political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions. Lawmakers said they were disturbed by the attacks as Twin Cities residents mourned.",
      "Brightly colored flowers and small American flags were placed Sunday on the gray marbled stone of the Minnesota State Capitol along with a photo of the Hortmans. People scrawled messages on small notes including, \u201cYou were our leader through the hardest of times. Rest in Power.\u201d",
      "Pam Stein came with flowers and kneeled by the memorial. An emotional Stein called Hortman an \u201cabsolute powerhouse\u201d and \u201cthe real unsung hero of Minnesota government.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe had a way of bringing people to the table and getting things done like no one else could do,\u201d said Stein, a retired lawyer.",
      "The Hoffmans were recovering from surgery, according to their nephew, Mat Ollig.",
      "Authorities have not yet given details on a motive.",
      "A list of about 70 names was found in writings recovered from the fake police vehicle that was left at the crime scene, the officials said. The writings and list of names included prominent state and federal lawmakers and community leaders, along with abortion rights advocates and information about healthcare facilities, according to the officials.",
      "A Minnesota official told the AP that lawmakers who had been outspoken in favor of abortion rights were on the list. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.",
      "The attacks prompted warnings to other state elected officials and the cancellation of planned \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstrations against President Donald Trump, though some went ahead anyway, including one that drew tens of thousands to the State Capitol in St. Paul. Authorities said the suspect had \u201cNo Kings\u201d flyers in his car.",
      "Law enforcement agents recovered several AK-style firearms from the suspect\u2019s vehicle, and he was believed to still be armed with a pistol, a person familiar with the matter told AP. The person could not publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Boelter is a former political appointee who served on the same state workforce development board as Hoffman, records show, though it was not clear if or how well they knew each other.",
      "Around 6 a.m. Saturday, Boelter texted friends to apologize for his actions, though he didn't say what he had done.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn\u2019t gone this way. \u2026 I\u2019m sorry for all the trouble this has caused,\" he wrote in messages viewed by the AP.",
      "Police first responded to reports of gunfire at the Hoffmans\u2019 home shortly after 2 a.m. Saturday and found the couple with multiple gunshot wounds.",
      "Local police from Brooklyn Park were assisting with the call and decided to proactively check on Hortman's home nearby, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said Saturday.",
      "There, they encountered what appeared to be a police vehicle and a man dressed as an officer leaving the house. Officers confronted him, he fired at them and officers returned fire. The suspect then retreated back into the home and fled on foot, Bruley said. He left behind the vehicle designed to look like a police car where authorities later found writings.",
      "On social media, Gov. Tim Walz remembered Hortman Sunday as, \u201cThe most consequential Speaker in state history.\u201d",
      "Hortman, 55, had been the top Democratic leader in the state House since 2017. She led Democrats in a three-week walkout at the beginning of this year\u2019s session in a power struggle with Republicans. Under a power-sharing agreement, she turned the gavel over to Republican Rep. Lisa Demuth and assumed the title speaker emerita.",
      "Hortman used her position as speaker in 2023 to champion expanded protections for abortion rights, including legislation to solidify Minnesota\u2019s status as a refuge for patients from restrictive states who travel to the state to seek abortions \u2014 and to protect providers who serve them.",
      "The couple had two adult children.",

      "\u201cGoliath is my hero, and I am sure he will soon be an inspiration to many others!\u201d Zoo Miami spokesman Ron Magill said in a statement. \u201cHe is living proof that where there is a will, there is a way and to never give up!\u201d",
      "One egg out of a clutch of eight laid on Jan. 27 successfully hatched on June 4, officials said. Besides being Goliath's first offspring, it's also the first time one of the endangered reptiles has hatched at Zoo Miami. The animals' numbers were drastically reduced before the 20th century by human exploitation and the introduction of invasive species to the Galapagos Islands. Modern threats include climate change and habitat loss.",
      "According to Goliath\u2019s official record, he hatched on the island of Santa Cruz in the Galapagos on June 15, between 1885 and 1890. The island group is located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean, several hundred miles west of mainland Ecuador.",
      "Goliath arrived at the Bronx Zoo in 1929 and moved to Zoo Miami in 1981. He has bred with several different females during his time at Zoo Miami, but he has never sired an offspring. The new hatchling's mother, Sweet Pea, is estimated to be between 85 and 100 years old.",
      "Both parents are doing well in their public habitat, officials said. The hatchling appears to be healthy in a separate enclosure. Wild hatchlings are not raised by their parents.",

      "The prospect of a work requirement for able-bodied Medicaid recipients is sparking fears",
      "It took Crystal Strickland years to qualify for Medicaid, which she needs for a heart condition.",
      "Strickland, who's unable to work due to her condition, chafed when she learned that the U.S. House has passed a bill that would impose a work requirement for many able-bodied people to get health insurance coverage through the low-cost, government-run plan for lower-income people.",
      "\u201cWhat sense does that make?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat about the people who can\u2019t work but can\u2019t afford a doctor?\u201d",
      "The measure is part of the version of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful\u201d bill that cleared the House last month and is now up for consideration in the Senate. Trump is seeking to have it passed by July 4.",
      "The bill as it stands would cut taxes and government spending \u2014 and also upend portions of the nation\u2019s social safety net.",
      "For proponents, the ideas behind the work requirement are simple: Crack down on fraud and stand on the principle that taxpayer-provided health coverage isn't for those who can work but aren\u2019t. The measure includes exceptions for those who are under 19 or over 64, those with disabilities, pregnant women, main caregivers for young children, people recently released from prisons or jails \u2014 or during certain emergencies. It would apply only to adults who receive Medicaid through expansions that 40 states chose to undertake as part of the 2010 health insurance overhaul.",
      "Many details of how the changes would work would be developed later, leaving several unknowns and causing anxiety among recipients who worry that their illnesses might not be enough to exempt them.",
      "Advocates and sick and disabled enrollees worry \u2014 based largely on their past experience \u2014 that even those who might be exempted from work requirements under the law could still lose benefits because of increased or hard-to-meet paperwork mandates.",
      "Strickland, a 44-year-old former server, cook and construction worker who lives in Fairmont, North Carolina, said she could not afford to go to a doctor for years because she wasn't able to work. She finally received a letter this month saying she would receive Medicaid coverage, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's already kind of tough to get on Medicaid,\u201d said Strickland, who has lived in a tent and times and subsisted on nonperishable food thrown out by stores. \u201cIf they make it harder to get on, they're not going to be helping.\u201d",
      "Steve Furman is concerned that his 43-year-old son, who has autism, could lose coverage.",
      "The bill the House adopted would require Medicaid enrollees to show that they work, volunteer or go to school at least 80 hours a month to continue to qualify.",
      "A disability exception would likely apply to Furman's son, who previously worked in an eyeglasses plant in Illinois for 15 years despite behavioral issues that may have gotten him fired elsewhere.",
      "Furman said government bureaucracies are already impossible for his son to navigate, even with help.",
      "It took him a year to help get his son onto Arizona's Medicaid system when they moved to Scottsdale in 2022, and it took time to set up food benefits. But he and his wife, who are retired, say they don't have the means to support his son fully.",
      "\u201cShould I expect the government to take care of him?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I do expect them to have humanity.\u201d",
      "About 71 million adults are enrolled in Medicaid now. And most of them \u2014 around 92% \u2014 are working, caregiving, attending school or disabled. Earlier estimates of the budget bill from the Congressional Budget Office found that about 5 million people stand to lose coverage.",
      "A KFF tracking poll conducted in May found that the enrollees come from across the political spectrum. About one-fourth are Republicans; roughly one-third are Democrats.",
      "The poll found that about 7 in 10 adults are worried that federal spending reductions on Medicaid will lead to more uninsured people and would strain health care providers in their area. About half said they were worried reductions would hurt the ability of them or their family to get and pay for health care.",
      "Amaya Diana, an analyst at KFF, points to work requirements launched in Arkansas and Georgia as keeping people off Medicaid without increasing employment.",
      "Amber Bellazaire, a policy analyst at the Michigan League for Public Policy, said the process to verify that Medicaid enrollees meet the work requirements could be a key reason people would be denied or lose eligibility.",
      "\u201cMassive coverage losses just due to an administrative burden rather than ineligibility is a significant concern,\u201d she said.",
      "One KFF poll respondent, Virginia Bell, a retiree in Starkville, Mississippi, said she's seen sick family members struggle to get onto Medicaid, including one who died recently without coverage.",
      "She said she doesn't mind a work requirement for those who are able \u2014 but worries about how that would be sorted out. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to determine who needs it and who doesn't need it,\u201d she said.",
      "Lexy Mealing, 54 of Westbury, New York, who was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2021 and underwent a double mastectomy and reconstruction surgeries, said she fears she may lose the medical benefits she has come to rely on, though people with \u201cserious or complex\u201d medical conditions could be granted exceptions.",
      "She now works about 15 hours a week in \u201cgig\u201d jobs but isn't sure she can work more as she deals with the physical and mental toll of the cancer.",
      "Mealing, who used to work as a medical receptionist in a pediatric neurosurgeon\u2019s office before her diagnosis and now volunteers for the American Cancer Society, went on Medicaid after going on short-term disability.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine going through treatments right now and surgeries and the uncertainty of just not being able to work and not have health insurance,\u201d she said.",
      "Felix White, who has Type I diabetes, first qualified for Medicaid after losing his job as a computer programmer several years ago.",
      "The Oreland, Pennsylvania, man has been looking for a job, but finds that at 61, it's hard to land one.",
      "Medicaid, meanwhile, pays for a continuous glucose monitor and insulin and funded foot surgeries last year, including one that kept him in the hospital for 12 days.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way I could have afforded that,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have lost my foot and probably died.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- There were funnel cakes, stands of festival bling and American flags aplenty. There were mighty machines of war, brought out to dazzle and impress. And there was the spray of tear gas against demonstrators in Los Angeles and Atlanta, and rolling waves of anti-Trump resistance coast to coast.",
      "In scenes of celebration, protest and trepidation Saturday, masses of Americans cheered for a rousing Army parade like none seen in Washington in generations. Masses more rallied across the country against a president derided by his critics as an authoritarian, would-be king.",
      "On Saturday, the U.S. Army turned 250 and President Donald Trump 79. The double birthday bash energized crowds of well-wishers and military families in the capital while others decried the militarization of city streets \u2014 in Los Angeles, where a federalized National Guard and U.S. Marines remained deployed against unrest, and in Washington for the parade.",
      "In these times, the fault lines of American life were evident.",
      "\u201cOne nation under distress,\u201d read a sign carried in a crowd of 1,000 protesters on the grounds of Florida\u2019s old Capitol in Tallahassee. Forewarned of a heavy state response if the crowd caused any trouble, organizers implored the peaceful protesters to not so much as jaywalk.",
      "Yet, in his Trump 2024 shirt, retired American Airlines pilot Larry Stallard happily lived out \u201cone thing on my bucket list\u201d from his perch on the parade route. Stallard, 82, came from Kansas City for the event. He declared Trump \u201cone of the best presidents in my lifetime\u201d and concluded, \u201cIt's been a long day, but it's worth it.\u201d",
      "Trump's remarks, about eight minutes, were brief for him as he capped the showy parade he had longed for in his first term and, early in his second, finally got.",
      "\u201cThere is no earthly force more powerful than the brave heart of the U.S. military or an Army Ranger paratrooper or Green Beret,\u201d he told the crowd. From Bunker Hill to the mountains of Afghanistan, the president said, \u201cthe Army has forged a legacy of unmatched courage, untold sacrifice.\u201d",
      "Spirited \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests unfolded in cities and towns across the American republic. But in Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz asked people to stay away from anti-Trump demonstrations after the assassination of state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, by a gunman still on the loose.",
      "In Los Angeles, epicenter of days-long protests sparked by Trump's crackdown on immigrants, police on horseback charged a previously calm crowd, firing tear gas and crowd control projectiles. \"We weren\u2019t doing anything but standing around chanting peaceful protest,\u201d said Samantha Edgerton, a 37-year-old bartender.",
      "Law enforcement officers in Atlanta deployed tear gas to divert several hundred nonviolent protesters heading toward Interstate 285 in the northern part of the city. In Culpeper, Virginia, one person was struck by an SUV that police say was intentionally accelerated into the crowd as protesters were leaving an event.",
      "In Washington, more than 6,000 soldiers marched in period-by-period uniforms, dating back to the garb of the ragtag Continental Army and the rise of a nation that would become the world\u2019s most potent military power. In the mix: tanks, parachute jumps and flyovers by more than 60 aircraft.",
      "With evening thunderstorms in the forecast, the parade started well ahead of schedule. In the first 40 minutes, it sped through more than 200 years of Army history, from 1775 to 1991.",
      "Vietnam-era helicopters, including the Huey, roared overhead, as did World War II-vintage aircraft. Sherman tanks, used extensively in that war's European theater, rumbled in the procession along with modern machinery. The Army's Golden Knights parachute team jumped early, releasing streaks of red smoke across the sky and making the crowd scream with excitement as they floated to the ground.",
      "At the festival earlier, attendees sported apparel celebrating both the Army and Trump. Vendors moved through the crowd, selling Trump-themed merchandise, while others offered gear commemorating the Army\u2019s milestone.",
      "It was all too much for Wind Euler, 62, who flew from Arizona to join the protesters. \u201cMy father was a Marine in Iwo Jima, and he was a Republican,\" Euler said. \"I think he would be appalled by the fascist display this parade shows.\u201d",
      "In a camouflage jacket and Army baseball hat, Army veteran Aaron Bogner of Culpeper, Virginia, decried how he believes Trump is using the U.S. military to advance a personal agenda. \u201cI think it\u2019s shameful,\" Bogner said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an engineered birthday party. It\u2019s an excuse to have tanks in your streets like North Korea.\u201d",
      "Above all, Bogner said, he came to protest the deployment of U.S. troops in Los Angeles after lawlessness broke out in pockets of the city along with peaceful demonstrations. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to understand when it became unpatriotic to protest,\u201d he said.",
      "In Atlanta, police yelled \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d and \u201cyou must disperse\u201d into megaphones as they used tear gas to divert protesters off the road. The tear gas caused the crowd to disperse away from the interstate. Two police helicopters flew above as the crowd moved.",
      "Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, used bicycles to corral marchers. After the main \u201cNo Kings\u201d march ended in Charlotte, a second, unpermitted march began, producing a police confrontation.",
      "Officers formed a barricade with bicycles and yelled \u201cmove back\u201d as protesters attempted to march through uptown Charlotte. In response, demonstrators chanted \u201clet us walk\u201d as police continued to shift them back. Protesters also shouted \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d and \u201cno more Nazis.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "President Donald Trump has long bet that he can scare allies into submission \u2014 a gamble that is increasingly being tested ahead of the Group of Seven summit beginning Monday in Canada.",
      "He's threatened stiff tariffs in the belief that other nations would crumple. He's mused about taking over Canada and Greenland. He's suggested he will not honor NATO's obligations to defend partners under attack. And he's used Oval Office meetings to try to intimidate the leaders of Ukraine and South Africa.",
      "But many world leaders see fewer reasons to be cowed by Trump, even as they recognize the risks if he followed through on his threats. They believe he will ultimately back down \u2014 since many of his plans could inflict harm on the U.S. \u2014 or that he can simply be charmed and flattered into cooperating.",
      "\u201cMany leaders still seem intimidated by Trump, but increasingly they are catching on to his pattern of bullying,\u201d said Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn places as diverse as Canada, Iran, China and the EU, we are seeing increasing signs that leaders now recognize that Trump is afraid of anything resembling a fair fight. And so they are increasingly willing to stand up to him.\u201d",
      "In the 22 instances in which Trump has publicly threatened military action since his first term, the U.S. only used force twice, according to a May analysis by Shapiro.",
      "Ahead of the G7 summit, there are already signs of subtle pushback against Trump from fellow leaders in the group. French President Emanuel Macron planned to visit Greenland over the weekend in a show of European solidarity. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said the U.S. is no longer the \u201cpredominant\u201d force in the world after Trump's tariffs created fissures in a decades-long partnership between the U.S. and its northern neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe stood shoulder to shoulder with the Americans throughout the Cold War and in the decades that followed, as the United States played a predominant role on the world stage,\" Carney said this past week in French. \"Today, that predominance is a thing of the past.\u201d",
      "The new prime minister added that with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the U.S. became the global hegemon, a position of authority undermined by Trump's transactional nature that puts little emphasis on defending democratic values or the rule of law.",
      "\u201cNow the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony: charging for access to its markets and reducing its relative contributions to our collective security,\u201d Carney said.",
      "Israel\u2019s attack on Iran has added a new wrinkle to the global picture as the summit leaders gather to tackle some of the world\u2019s thorniest problems",
      "A senior Canadian official said it was decided early on that the G7 won\u2019t be issuing a joint communiqu\u00e9 as it has at past summits \u2014 an indication of how hard it can be to get Trump on the same page with other world leaders. The White House said individual leader statements will be issued on the issues being discussed.",
      "Speaking last month at a conference in Singapore, Macron called France a \u201cfriend and an ally of the United States\u201d but pushed back against Trump's desire to dominate what other countries do. Macron said efforts to force other nations to choose between the U.S. and China would lead to the breakdown of the global order put in place after World War II.",
      "\u201cWe want to cooperate, but we do not want to be instructed on a daily basis what is allowed, what is not allowed, and how our life will change because of the decision of a single person,\u201d Macron said.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pushed back against Trump's agenda of levying higher tariffs on imported goods, arguing it would hurt economic growth. The Japanese leader specifically called Trump ahead of the summit to confirm their plans to talk on the sidelines, which is a greater focus for Japan than the summit itself.",
      "\u201cI called him as I also wanted to congratulate his birthday, though one day earlier,\u201d Ishiba said.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the summit was an opportunity for Trump to \u201cmend\u201d relationships with other countries so China would be unable to exploit differences among the G7.",
      "She said other foreign leaders are \u201cnot intimidated\u201d by Trump's actions, which could be driving them away from tighter commitments with the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe conversations that I\u2019ve had with those leaders suggest that they think that the partnership with the United States has been really important, but they also understand that there are other opportunities,\u201d Shaheen said.",
      "The White House did not respond to emailed questions for this story.",
      "Having originally made his reputation in real estate and hospitality, Trump has taken kindly to certain foreign visitors, such as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.",
      "Starmer has sought to keep Trump in line with Europe in supporting Ukraine and NATO instead of brokering any truces that would favor Russia. He has echoed the president\u2019s language about NATO members spending more on defense. But in his Oval Office visit, Starmer also pleased Trump by delivering an invite for a state visit from King Charles III.",
      "The German government said it, too, wanted to send a public signal of unity, saying that while Trump's recent meeting with Merz at the White House went harmoniously, the next test is how the relationship plays out in a team setting.",
      "There will also be other world leaders outside of the G7 nations attending the summit in mountainous Kananaskis, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump dressed down in the Oval Office.",
      "Italy's Meloni has positioned herself as a \u201cbridge\u201d between the Trump administration and the rest of Europe. But Italy\u2019s strong support of Ukraine and Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs on European goods have put Meloni, the only European leader to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration, in a difficult position.",
      "Mark Sobel, U.S. chair of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, an independent think tank, said Trump's \u201ctrade policies, backing for right wing European movements, seeming preference for dealing with authoritarians and many of his other actions are alienating our G7 allies,\u201d even if the U.S. president is correct that Europe needs to do more on defense.",
      "But even as other G7 leaders defuse any public disputes with Trump, the U.S. president's vision for the world remains largely incompatible with they want.",
      "\u201cIn short, behind the curtains, and notwithstanding whatever theater, the Kananaskis summit will highlight a more fragmented G7 and an adrift global economy,\" Sobel said.",

      "Democrats in Virginia are holding primary elections Tuesday, and one name is getting talked about a lot: President Donald Trump",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- RICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014",
      "Two Virginia Democrats are battling Tuesday to be their party's nominee for attorney general. Yet, the name mentioned most in their campaigns is not that of their opponent, but rather a man who lives just over the Arlington Memorial Bridge: President Donald Trump.",
      "The barrage of changes Trump has wrought to American culture in the first few months of his second White House residency has ignited the campaigns of Virginia Democrats Jay Jones and Shannon Taylor as they appeal unrelentingly to the most devout swaths of their base ahead of down-ballot primary elections. The primary will also determine the party\u2019s nominations this year for lieutenant governor and some contested seats in the House of Delegates.",
      "In one of only two states electing governors in November \u2014 the other is New Jersey \u2014 the caustic anti-Trump rhetoric could be a hint of what voters nationwide will hear from Democrats in next year's midterm elections, when the stakes will be higher.",
      "Virginia's nominees for governor have been settled by default. Democrat Abigail Spanberger became her party's nominee after running unopposed, and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears was the only contender who gathered enough signatures to be on the ballot. The other statewide races are for attorney general and lieutenant governor, and Democrats in both contests seem to be vying to top each other with anti-Trump rhetoric and caustic ads.",
      "Republicans are not hosting statewide primaries this year, so only Democrats will pick a nominee for lieutenant governor. It's a part-time position that pays about $36,000 a year but is often a stepping stone to higher office. Six Democrats want the job, and most of them have pushed ad after ad on the airwaves and online about their commitment to taking on Trump if elected to the mostly ceremonial role.",
      "In the contest for attorney general, Jones and Taylor are competing in much the same way. Turnout is likely to be sluggish, which means firing up base voters is widely seen as the way to go. The last time a left-wing candidate for governor ran unopposed, roughly 142,000 Democrats voted for an attorney general nominee compared with more than 485,000 this past election cycle.",
      "Still, the AG's race has been spicy, more so when the candidates' criticism isn't directed at each other. Jones and Taylor have lambasted the White House and argued that the administration\u2019s actions should be litigated in court. When they are not lamenting Trump, their attacks are directed toward incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking reelection.",
      "In their respective campaigns, the Democrats argue that Miyares submits to the president by not suing him. They say that sets him apart from more progressive attorneys general across the United States, who are going to court over such things as birthright citizenship and elections. Their main message: A Democrat will take the White House to trial when Miyares won\u2019t \u2014 and saving democracy starts there.",
      "\u201cThe job is to protect Virginians, to fight for them, to work for them, to keep us safe,\u201d Jones said while campaigning in June in Falls Church, Virginia, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he is not going after them.\u201d",
      "Last month, Taylor told a room full of Democratic voters that Miyares would enable Trump\u2019s overreaches in Virginia, and potentially double down on institutions that don\u2019t comply with the president.",
      "Either way, \u201cthe result is the same for Virginians: getting hurt,\u201d she said.",
      "In a wide-ranging interview in May, Miyares said he identifies as a balls-and-strikes Republican. The former Virginia Beach state delegate, elected top prosecutor in 2021, worked to reduce violent crime. He sought settlements from Big Pharma. When he felt President Joe Biden\u2019s administration overstepped, he went to court.",
      "But as Trump was ushered into office for a second term, Miyares entered new political terrain. Unlike most other states, Virginians will elect their attorney general this November, nearly a year after the country voted for the president and his consequential agenda.",
      "Miyares has waded into the political arena. He often spars on social media with progressive prosecutors throughout Virginia for being too lenient in prosecuting criminal cases.",
      "Still, Miyares rebuffed the notion that suing Trump is his top concern. He said the Democrats looking to replace him fail to understand the nature of his position.",
      "The attorney general touted meaningful work his office has shouldered: holding listening sessions for crime victims, designating resources to support law enforcement and beefing up his office\u2019s prosecutions of child support cases.",
      "He flashed his law enforcement badge, tucked within a leather wallet, and described the emblem as a guidepost for being an effective people\u2019s prosecutor.",
      "\u201cThey seem very obsessed with Donald Trump, whereas I\u2019m obsessed with how am I going to keep Virginians safe?\u201d Miyares said.",

      "On the second weekend, in the same town: a public show of strength and nationalism constructed on a foundation of military might, law and order, a tour de force of force.",
      "And on the days in between: a city 2,000 miles from the capital locked in pitched battles over the use \u2014 abuse, many contend \u2014 of federal power and military authority to root out, detain and oust people who the current administration says do not belong.",
      "Today's United States \u2014 its possibility, its strength, its divisiveness, its polarization and fragmentation \u2014 is encapsulated in a single week in June 2025, its triumphs and frictions on vivid display.",
      "As events both planned and chaotically spontaneous play out, many Americans are frantically and sometimes furiously pondering assorted iterations of two questions: What is this country right now? And what should it be?",
      "Consider two quotes from recent days from two very different Americans.",
      "The first came last weekend, during World Pride in Washington, when a 58-year-old gay man from Philadelphia named David Begler summed up what many were messaging in the days leading up to it after months of Donald Trump's increasing attempts to target the LGBTQ community: \"I want us to send a message to the White House to focus on uplifting each other instead of dividing.\u201c",
      "The second came days ahead of the military parade planned Saturday for the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, from the mouth of the president on whose 79th birthday it will be held: \u201cIf there\u2019s any protester that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force,\u201d Donald Trump said. \u201cI haven\u2019t even heard about a protest, but you know, this is people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force.\u201d",
      "Among the competing visions of America in 2025: the desire to protest and seek a redress of grievances against the government vs. the desire for control, order \u2014 and a respect for the government and for authority.",
      "The volatile combination of demonstrations and the U.S. military is a potent one, with its most recent roots in the protest movement of the 1960s against the Vietnam War. A young generation that would later be known as baby boomers regularly squared off against police and sometimes the military over U.S. involvement in what was framed as a war against communism in Southeast Asia. Historians give those protesters a fair bit of the credit for that war ultimately ending in 1975. President Jimmy Carter ultimately pardoned more than 200,000 people who had dodged the draft for that conflict.",
      "Then, as now, many in the establishment criticized protesters bitterly, saying they were undermining a nation to which they should be grateful. Questions of loyalty and betrayal were thrown around. The role of the military in quelling civilian protests was bitterly contested, particularly after Ohio National Guardsmen opened fire and killed four students during antiwar protests in May 1970 at Kent State University.",
      "There are echoes of that this week, not only in Los Angeles but now in Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the deployment of 5,000 state National Guard troops ahead of the \u201cNo Kings Day of Defiance\u201d against the Trump administration's ongoing immigration raids. And as protesters in Los Angeles taunt the military and say guardsmen should be \u201cashamed\u201d to face off against what they call a just cause, it's easy to wonder: How can patriotism and protest coexist?",
      "Democracy has always been messy and resistant to consensus. That's part of why the national slogan of the United States is \u201ce pluribus unum\u201d \u2014 \u201cout of many, one.\u201d And Washington, D.C., as the nation's capital, has long been the place where the many have come to make themselves known as part of the one \u2014 and to be noticed.",
      "It was where the \u201cBonus Army\" of World War I veterans marched in 1932 to demand their promised postwar payments and be heard in a demonstration that ended violently. It was where the first National Boy Scout Jamboree was held on the National Mall in 1937. It was where the \u201cMarch on Washington,\u201d a centerpiece of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, ended with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s renowned \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. It was where, in 1995, the \u201cMillion Man March\u201d was held to address concerns of the American Black community, and where hundreds of thousands of women came to Washington largely in protest of Trump, just a day after his first inauguration.",
      "It is also the place where Americans remember, where the memorials to World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War sit. It is where the country erected stone shrines in various shapes and sizes to the presidents it most admired \u2014 Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt. It is the site of museums containing some of the most distilled expressions of culture \u2014 from the Holocaust Museum to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum to the National Museum of African American History.",
      "Is it so hard to believe, then, that two events as opposite as World Pride and a military parade unfold here, within blocks of each other, within a week's time? At a politically fractious moment when some families can hardly break bread without political arguments erupting over Trump, Gaza and Israel, immigration and LGBTQ rights, isn't it possible that the weird and downright uncomfortable juxtaposition of these two starkly different events might be the most American thing of all?",
      "Walt Whitman, one of the most famous poets in American history, had this to say about the the diversity of America when he wrote \u201cI Hear America Singing\u201d to underscore that its citizens all contribute to the nation's song: \u201cI am large. I contain multitudes.\u201d",
      "And in one week in June, at a time when the fate of the United States is being discussed in every direction we turn, the capital of Whitman's nation has become a showcase in displaying those messy democratic multitudes to the world. For better or for worse.",

      "Her testimony echoed what the jury heard in the trial's first week when Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura testified for four days that she engaged in hundreds of multiday \u201cfreak-offs\u201d while they dated from 2007 to 2018, having sex with male sex workers in front of Combs, who masturbated, filmed the encounters, and verbalized what he wanted to see sexually.",
      "Jane said she and Combs split up from Halloween 2023 until February 2024. During the break, she said, she flew on another famous rapper's private jet to Las Vegas, joining the celebrity to celebrate his romantic partner's birthday for a night that included dinner, a stripper's club visit and a hotel room party.",
      "In the hotel room, Jane testified, the rapper who was close friends with Combs made a pass at her amid flirtatious banter, saying he had always wanted to have sex with her. She said she danced in the hotel room, where a male sex worker was having sex with a woman, and at some point Jane flashed her breasts.",
      "Jane agreed with a lawyer's assessment that the famous rapper was \u201can individual at the top of the music industry as well ... an icon in the music industry.\u201d",

      "\u201cI believe they were asking me because maybe they just picked up the energy from me or I just maybe assumed that maybe they had already got an inclination that me and Sean had been doing kind of similar things,\u201d she said, noting that she referred a male sex worker she knew.",
      "A day after Jane finished testifying, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, made a surprise appearance at the courthouse and quickly learned what a tough ticket it is to get into the courtroom where his good friend Combs is on trial.",
      "Ye, wearing all white, was ushered by courthouse security to an overflow courtroom to watch the trial on a video monitor along with others who were unable to get into the courtroom. He lasted only a few minutes there before he made his courthouse exit, saying nothing during his trip except that he was there to support Combs.",
      "It turns out that Combs, the subject of several true-crime TV documentaries, is a bit of a true-crime fan himself.",
      "Jane revealed this week that his favorite show is \u201cDateline,\u201d the magazine-style NBC stalwart that is heavy on murders and mysteries.",
      "She told jurors that, in their alone time together, she and Combs would watch \u201cDateline\u201d for hours \u201ctill we fell asleep.\u201d",
      "Other activities when it was just the two of them included hugging, cuddling and bathing Combs, and giving him foot rubs, Jane testified.",
      "Jane testified that she last saw Combs in August, when they were in their \u201csame routine having sex and everything\u201d when Combs suggested that she invite over the very first male sex worker she had sex with in front of Combs.",

      "\u201cWhy not?\u201d she was asked before she responded: \u201cBecause he got arrested.\u201d",
      "The courtroom rules surrounding Jane's testimony were the strictest yet in a bid to protect her identity from becoming common knowledge.",

      "Agnifilo said the defense had consented to the \u201cpseudonymity\u201d of Jane.",

      "The fate of one anonymous juror was in limbo after the judge said Friday he will reconsider his decision to oust the juror even though he suspects he might have an \"agenda.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian said he had decided that conflicting answers from the juror about where he primarily lived \u2014 in New Jersey or New York \u2014 raised questions about his credibility and whether he was answering questions in a bid to stay on the jury. If the juror does primarily live with a girlfriend in New Jersey, he would be outside the court district and disqualified.",
      "Prosecutors said the juror's dismissal is required because of his conflicting answers. Defense lawyers argued that prosecutors were only trying to disqualify a Black juror and that his dismissal could spoil an otherwise diverse panel of jurors.",
      "The judge bristled at the suggestion that race was a factor, saying there was no support for claims that prosecutors did not use race-neutral arguments to exclude jurors during jury selection and now.",

      "A federal program that provides benefits to families of police officers and firefighters who die and become disabled on duty is rapidly growing while facing criticism for increasing delays in deciding claims.",
      "Congress created the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits program in 1976 to guarantee that the spouses and children of officers who put their lives on the line would receive financial support.",
      "But repeated expansions in eligibility approved by Congress, including three passed in the last five years, have made the program more popular and complex to administer. Critics say the program fails some families by taking too long to grant or deny benefits and making inconsistent rulings.",
      "An Associated Press analysis found that hundreds of families are waiting years to learn whether they qualify for payments, and more are ultimately being denied.",
      "New Jersey widow Sharline Volcy learned this month that she'd been awarded the benefits, more than 3 1/2 years after her husband, Ronald Donat, died while training at the Gwinnett County Police Academy in Georgia.",
      "Volcy said she was grateful for the aid, which will provide some financial security and help pay for her two daughters to go to college. But she said the long wait was stressful, when she was told time and again the claim remained under review and ultimately saw her inquiries ignored.",
      "\u201cThey told me they didn't know how long it would take because they don't have a deadline. That's the hardest thing to hear,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt defeated.\u201d",
      "She said lawyers didn't want to take the case, and a plea for help to her congressperson went nowhere. She said she'd given up hope and was lucky she had a job as an airport gate agent in the meantime.",
      "Volcy's experience isn't unique, and some cases take longer.",
      "As of late April, more than 120 claims by surviving relatives or disabled first responders have been awaiting initial determinations or rulings on their appeals for more than five years, according AP's findings. About a dozen have waited over a decade for an answer.",
      "The program has a goal of making determinations within one year but has not taken steps to track its progress, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report.",
      "But roughly three in 10 cases have not met that timeframe in recent years. As of late late April, 900 claims had been pending longer than one year. That includes claims from nearly every state.",
      "Republican lawmakers have introduced a bill to require the program to make determinations within 270 days.",
      "Over the last year, the denial rate has increased, with roughly one in three death and disability claims getting rejected.",
      "Applicants can appeal to a hearing officer and then the director if they choose, but that isn't common. Many say they can't afford attorneys or want to get on with their lives.",
      "Justice Department officials, who oversee the program, say they\u2019re making complicated decisions about whether cases meet legal criteria.",
      "\u201cDeath and disability claims involving complex medical and causation issues, voluminous evidence and conflicting medical opinions, take longer to determine, as do claims in various stages of appeal,\u201d they said in a statement.",
      "The program started as a simple $50,000 payout for the families of officers who were fatally shot on duty or died as a result of other violence or dangers.",
      "But Congress expanded the program in 1990 to cover some first responders who were disabled on duty, which made some determinations harder to reach. A 1998 law added educational benefits for the spouses and children of those deceased and disabled officers.",
      "Since 2020, Congress has passed three laws making many other types of deaths and disabilities eligible, including deaths related to COVID-19, deaths and injuries of those working rescue and cleanup operations after the September 2001 attacks, and responders who committed suicide under certain circumstances.",
      "Annual claims have more than doubled in the last five years, from 500 in 2019 to roughly 1,200 today.",
      "While many applicants have criticized the increasing delays, the leading group that represents the relatives of officers who die on duty has been silent.",
      "Critics say that\u2019s because the group, Concerns of Police Survivors, has a financial incentive not to criticize the program, which has awarded it tens of millions of dollars in grant funding in recent decades.",
      "The Missouri-based nonprofit recently received a new $6 million grant from the program to for its work with deceased officers\u2019 relatives, including counseling, hosting memorial events, educating agencies about the program and assisting with claims.",
      "The group\u2019s founder and retired executive director, Suzie Sawyer, said she was warned many years ago that fighting too hard for claimants could jeopardize its grant funding.",
      "But current spokesperson Sara Slone said advocacy isn't the group's mission and that it works \u201chand in hand\u201d with PSOB to assist applicants and provide education about benefits.",
      "Lisa Afolayan\u2019s husband died after a training exercise at the Border Patrol academy more than 16 years ago, but she\u2019s still fighting the program for benefits.",
      "An autopsy found that Nate Afolayan died from heat illness after completing a 1.5-mile test run in 88 degree heat, at a high altitude in the New Mexico desert.",
      "The program had awarded benefits to families after similar training deaths, dating back to an officer who died at an academy in 1988.",
      "But its independent investigation blamed Nate\u2019s death on sickle cell trait, a genetic condition that's usually benign but has been linked to rare exertion-related deaths in police, military and sports training.",
      "The program denied Lisa\u2019s claim and her subsequent appeals, arguing the death wasn't the result of heat along and didn't qualify.",
      "The program stood by its denial in 2024, even after a federal appeals court said it may have failed to adequately consider the weather\u2019s role and violated a law barring discrimination on the basis of genetic information.",
      "The appeals court is currently considering Lisa\u2019s second appeal, even as the couple\u2019s two children reach college age.",

      "The massive military parade that President Donald Trump has long wanted is set to step off from the Lincoln Memorial with tanks, bands and thousands of troops",
      "WASHINGTON -- The massive military parade that President Donald Trump has long wanted is set to step off from the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday evening, with tanks, bands and thousands of troops.",
      "And the biggest question marks are whether it will be overshadowed or delayed by either the weather in Washington or planned protests elsewhere around the country.",
      "Falling on Trump\u2019s 79th birthday, the parade was added just a few weeks ago to the Army\u2019s long-planned 250th anniversary celebration. It has triggered criticism for its price tag of up to $45 million and the possibility that the lumbering tanks could tear up city streets. The Army has taken a variety of steps to protect the streets, including laying metal plates down along the route.",
      "The daylong display of America\u2019s Army comes as Trump has shown his willingness to use his fighting forces in ways other U.S. presidents have typically avoided, inviting an array of lawsuits and accusations that he is politicizing the military.",
      "He has deployed the California National Guard and U.S. Marines to provide security during Los Angeles protests tied to immigration raids. It marks the first time in 60 years that a president activated the National Guard on federal orders inside a state without a governor\u2019s permission, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit to stop the deployments.",
      "Earlier in the week, Trump raised eyebrows during a speech at Fort Bragg when members of the 82nd Airborne Division were directed to stand behind Trump and they booed and cheered during his incendiary remarks, including condemnation of his predecessor, Joe Biden. There also was a pop-up \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d merchandise stand nearby selling souvenirs to troops in uniform.",
      "The Defense Department has a doctrine that prohibits troops from participating in political activity while in uniform. Members of Congress and military leaders have expressed concerns about the political displays during the speech at Fort Bragg.",
      "Trump so far has shrugged off concerns about the parade cost, the rainy forecast and the potential for protests.",
      "\u201cWhat a day it will be!!!\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site, adding later that he hoped the weather would cooperate but that if it doesn't, \u201cthat brings you good luck. That\u2019s OK too. Doesn\u2019t matter. Doesn\u2019t affect the tanks at all. Doesn\u2019t affect the soldiers. They\u2019re used to it. They\u2019re tough. Smart.\u201d",
      "As for the protests, he warned that \u201cthey will be met with very big force.\u201d",
      "The \u201cNo Kings\u201d rallies planned in hundreds of cities nationwide are meant to counter what organizers say are Trump\u2019s plans to feed his ego on his 79th birthday and Flag Day. No protests are scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C., however, and officials have said they so far have no indication of any security threat.",
      "About 6 in 10 Americans say Saturday\u2019s parade is \u201cnot a good use\u201d of government money, including the vast majority of people, 78%, who neither approve nor disapprove of the parade overall, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "The parade will wind down Constitution Avenue, which is already lined with security fencing and barriers. Army helicopters and aircraft will fly above, and the march will be capped off by a parachute jump, a concert featuring \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.\u201d singer Lee Greenwood and fireworks.",
      "With rain expected, there is a chance the parade could be interrupted by thunderstorms.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly has said the march will go on rain or shine. But it could be delayed if there is lightning, with authorities quick to empty the expansive National Mall if it happens during major events.",
      "The parade fulfills Trump's expressed desire for a big parade that he tried to get done in his first presidential term after seeing one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Trump said that after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, he wanted an even grander one on Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "The Army expects as many as 200,000 people could attend the festival and parade. The festival will begin around 9:30 a.m. EDT and feature fitness competitions, demonstrations, equipment displays, music and a cake-cutting ceremony.",
      "The parade is set to begin at 6:30 p.m. EDT, but parts of it \u2014 including the horse-drawn caissons and other units \u2014 start at the Pentagon, head over a bridge and meet up with some of the heavier tanks and equipment. Officials did not want the more-than-60-ton M1A1 Abrams tanks and Stryker vehicles crossing the bridge.",
      "Timed down to the minute, the march will be divided into sections by history \u2014 with equipment and troops in full dress from each period.",
      "It will include a total of 6,169 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery, while 62 aircraft fly overhead.",
      "At the end of the parade, Trump will swear in 250 new or reenlisting troops, and the Army's Golden Knights parachute team will jump onto the Mall. That will be followed by the concert and fireworks.",

      "In the new biography \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television\" (Simon & Schuster), Todd S. Purdum explores the impact on American culture by the Cuban-born entertainer who (as husband and business partner of Lucille Ball) changed the rules of TV.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Purdum on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" June 15!",
      "\"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television\"",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

    "summary": "The Cuban-born entertainer broke conventions when he co-starred with wife Lucille Ball in \"I Love Lucy,\" playing a straight-man sitcom dad. Now, a new biography reveals his lesser-known contributions to television.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 1951, television audiences were introduced to a show biz-obsessed redhead and her bandleader husband, played by the real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. While Lucy was undeniably the star on-camera, off-camera it was Desi, a refugee from Cuba with no connection to the world of entertainment, who would change the way television worked.",
      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

      "\"Mike and I started writing surf songs,\" he said. \"But I never surfed, and he never surfed, either.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Jun 2025 09:20:46 -0400",
    "summary": "Since his death in 1981 at age 38, the singer-songwriter's legacy has only grown beyond such emotional songs as \"Cat's in the Cradle\" and \"Taxi,\" to include charities he founded to address food insecurity, while living life with a simple credo: \"When in doubt, do something.\"",
    "story": [
      "Harry Chapin's #1 hit \"Cat's In the Cradle,\" from 1974, may be one of the most powerful songs ever written about fatherhood. It tells the tale of a very busy dad:",
      "My son turned ten just the other day He said, \"Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play Can you teach me to throw?\" I said, \"Not today, I got a lot to do.\" he said, \"That's OK.\" And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed, Said, \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah. You know, I'm gonna be like him\"",
      "And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon. \"When you coming home, Dad?\" \"I don't know when, We'll get together then.You know we'll have a good time then\"",
      "To hear Harry Chapin perform \"Cat's in the Cradle,\" click on the video embed below:",
      "So, how did Chapin's own children feel about that song?",
      "Jen Chapin said, \"The one time when I get a little eeehhh is when somebody tells me, like, 'Oh, your dad, he played a three-and-a-half-hour concert, and then he signed every single poetry book, and he kissed my girlfriend, and \u2026' And I'm like, 'That's great, but that was time we didn't have.'\"",
      "Jen and her brothers, Jason and Josh, want to be clear: Harry Chapin was not the dad in the song. \"He really loved kids,\" Jen said. \"When he came home, he wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm just gonna, like, zone out.' He was, 'Yes! Projects! Trips! Family outings!'\"",
      "\"Cat's In the Cradle\" was originally a poem written by Harry's wife, Sandy, now 90, but it wasn't about him. \"It was based on the relationship her first husband had with his father,\" said Jason. \"My mother was always observing how they didn't connect on a father-son basis.\"",
      "Harry Chapin came from a musical family. He and two of his brothers formed a band. \"We became the Chapin Brothers,\" said Harry's younger brother, Tom Chapin. \"And we played together for ten years. And it was the only time we were ever cool!\"",
      "Tom has his own successful performing career, but Harry was always the driven one. \"When I was a kid, I came up with this line that the family loved: 'Two's company, Harry's a crowd!'\" he laughed. Harry, he said, was outgoing, \"and unafraid. He had this energy that was astonishing.\"",
      "But as his son Jason recalls, Harry's path to success was never a sure thing: \"He was depressed a lot during college. He had failed in many things, and I think that he was really desperate to be successful at something.\"",
      "His first love was documentaries. In fact, he directed one, \"Legendary Champions,\" that got an Oscar nomination. But music won out. In 1972, while he was performing as the warmup act for his brothers' band, Elektra Records signed him up. He was 30 years old.",
      "Tom Chapin says he was surprised that Harry was plucked, \"but not shocked, let's put it that way. He was great. We were good. But he was great.\"",
      "His first hit was \"Taxi,\" another story of broken dreams:",
      "And she said we must get together,But I knew it'd never be arranged.And she handed me twenty dollars,For a two-fifty fare, she said,\"Harry, keep the change.\" \u2026",
      "And she walked away in silence,  It's strange, how you never know,  But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for,  Such a long, long time ago.",
      "Harry Chapin performs \"Taxi\":",
      "According to son Josh, his mother Sandy encouraged his dad to do something with his celebrity: \"She asked, 'Do you wanna be on the cover of the Hit Parade or Time magazine?' And he thought about it, and he said, 'You know what? There really is an emptiness to just chasing celebrity and trying to become a bigger rock star.'\"",
      "Harry decided he'd do something about hunger.\u00a0 He began devoting his time, money and fame to charities that addressed food insecurity. He helped convince Jimmy Carter to start a presidential commission on world hunger.",
      "\"I would hate to be 75 years old, and say, 'If only I had\u2026,' 'I wish I had\u2026,' 'I wonder what my life meant\u2026,'\" Chapin once said. \"My credo is, when in doubt, do something.\"",
      "And he became the king of the benefit concert. \"I do about 220 concerts a year, about a hundred of which are benefits,\" Chapin said in 1980. \"In the long run, we're not sure about a prior-life or an after-life. We're all hoping for that. But what we can do is maximize what we have in this brief flicker of time in the infinity, and try to milk that.\"",
      "Time for Harry Chapin was short. On July 16, 1981, he died in car crash. He was 38. \"The world shook,\" Tom Chapin said. \"The universe shook, when Harry's suddenly not there.\"",
      "Memorials were held, tribute concerts performed, foundations founded. But Chapin's most lasting legacies are the charities he built. In 1975 he'd cofounded WhyHunger, with a priest and radio DJ named Bill Ayres. Today, it partners with organizations in 25 countries \u2013 helping to establish a sustainable farming school in Colombia; fostering traditional farming practices in Panama; and supporting programs in the U.S., like an urban farm and co-op in Detroit.",
      "In 1980, Chapin started Long Island Cares, a food bank. \"Everyone thinks of Long Island as a rich bastion of the country; it's not,\" said the food bank's CEO, Paule Pachter. \"There are pockets of affluence here, but most Long Islanders are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\"",
      "On an annual basis, Long Island Cares distributes 16 million pounds of food. \"That's roughly 14.5 million meals,\" Pachter said.",
      "Chapin's biggest hits were his story songs. Most people think of them as tragic tales, especially \"Cat's in the Cradle\":",
      "I've long since retired and my son's moved away. I called him up just the other day. I said, \"I'd like to see you if you don't mind.\" He said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time. You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu, But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad. It's been sure nice talking to you.\" And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me, He'd grown up just like me. My boy was just like me.",
      "In the song's ironic twist ending, the grown son becomes too busy for his dad. But Jason Chapin points out that there's another way to look at that turn: \"Some people interpret the last verse, when the dad calls the son to say, 'Let's get together,' the son is too busy for his dad, because he's busy with his own family, being a good dad. It needs a little close reading sometimes.\"",
      "The surviving Chapins still feel the pain of a life cut short, but they're still active in his charities, and remain inspired by Harry's message.",
      "Tom Chapin recalled, \"James, the oldest brother, said it at the funeral: 'We lost Harry. Those are big shoes to fill. But we can't fill 'em. You can't be Harry. You don't wanna be Harry. Just fill your own shoes a little fuller.'",
      "\"And when in doubt, do something!\" Tom added. \"Don't forget that!\"",

    "story": [
      "For half a century, Beach Boys songs like \"Fun, Fun, Fun\"  have promised unending summers of fun in the sun -- not at all like the life founding Beach Boy Brian Wilson actually led for many years, as Anthony Mason tells us now in our Sunday Profile:",
      "On a warm summer night at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles last month, Brian Wilson -- backed by a band that included fellow former Beach Boy Al Jardine -- was running through his repertoire of classics when a cake was wheeled out from backstage by the extended Wilson family.",
      "On this night, the man many regard as one of America's greatest living songwriters turned 73.",
      "Well, East coast girls are hip, \tI really dig those styles they wear. \tAnd the Southern girls, with the way they talk, \tThey knock me out when I'm down there. \tThe Midwest farmer's daughters really make you feel alright. \tAnd the Northern girls with the way they kiss \tThey keep their boyfriends warm at night.",
      "I wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California girls.",
      "-- \"California Girls,\" by Brian Wilson and Mike Love (1965)",
      "Wilson, who created the sun & surf sound that's still the soundtrack for the American summer, has had a summer of milestones. On tour again, he has just released his 11th solo album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" and is the subject of a new film about his life, \"Love & Mercy.\"",
      "Mason asked, \"How did you feel when you saw the film?\"",
      "\"I was very happy to see the good parts,\" Wilson said. \"But the dark periods were, like, very rough to watch.\"",
      "John Cusack plays an older Brian Wilson, the artist struggling to recover from depression, mental illness and drug abuse. Paul Dano pays the younger Brian Wilson, the musical genius who dreams up the Beach Boys' intricate harmonies and orchestrations.",
      "Wilson was just 20 when the Beach Boys signed with Capitol Records and made their first album in an L.A. studio.",
      "Mason asked, \"Do you remember recording in this room?\"",
      "\"I remember recording 'If everybody had an ocean across the USA ...'\" Wilson said.",
      "He would create the most successful band in America, blending the voices of his brothers Dennis and Carl, cousin Mike Love, and close friend Al Jardine. \"Mike on bass, Al and Dennis and Carl in the mid-range, and me on falsetto. We all sang together. And the harmony just happened.\"",
      "\"Love & Mercy\" focuses on two pivotal points in Wilson's life: First, the recording of The Beach Boys' highly-influential \"Pet Sounds\" album in 1965, that featured \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows.\"",
      "\"I was so proud of that album, I could have cried,\" said Wilson. \"Very proud of it.\"",
      "\"Your father fought you about it, and the band fought you about it,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Well, they didn't like it. Mike and the guys didn't like it. They, you know, thought it was too advanced music. They wanted to keep making car songs and surf songs. I said, 'Guys, we gotta grow. We've gotta grow musically.'\"",
      "The film's other focus is the 1980s, and Wilson's troubled relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, the psychologist accused of making him a virtual prisoner.",
      "It took nearly two decades for the film to be made. And when Brian's wife, Melinda, first saw it, she said, \"I got up and I bolted. I drove around the city for two hours, And it was tough. It was tough to watch.\"",
      "\"What were you doing while you were driving around the city?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Just thinking. 'Oh my God, did we do the right thing? It's been 19 years and this is how it's ending.'\"",
      "\"And how did you make peace with it?\"",
      "\"It was the truth,\" she said. \"So that's how I made peace with it. When you tell the truth, everything works out.\"",
      "The film tells the story of how Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) first met the troubled musician in 1986.",
      "\"I went to a Cadillac dealership to buy a car,\" recalled Wilson. \"And she was working there, and when I saw her I liked her the first time I saw her. And she sold me a car!\"",
      "Wilson gave Melinda a card that read, \"Frightened, scared, lonely.\"",
      "\"Did you look at that card right away?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Oh yeah, I was just like, What is he trying to tell me?  I knew I liked him. I knew I liked him a lot. And then when he left the card I was just like, what's going on here?\"",
      "Brian was then under the 24-hour care of Dr. Landy (Paul Giamatti in the film), who was controlling every aspect of his life, even co-writing songs, co-producing his records, and screening who could see him.",
      "Mason asked Wilson, \"When you think of that period of your life, what do you think of?\"",
      "\"Unhappiness,\" he said. \"Being tortured.  All that stuff.\"",
      "\"Is it something you try not to think of?\"",
      "\"Yeah.  Yeah.\"",
      "About six months into their relationship, Melinda decided she had to act: \"I called the Attorney General and he said there was nothing that could be done unless his family got involved. So a lot of times with Landy I had to be play-acting because I knew he was a bad guy.\"",
      "\"That's got to be an extremely difficult position to be in,\" said Mason.",
      "\"It was like I said to my mother:  'You know, I feel like a child is being abused.' And I couldn't find anybody that wanted to help. As much as I hate to say it, I think the family just -- they were at their rope's end with Brian and they didn't really know what to do.\"",
      "Landy eventually cut Melinda off from Brian.",
      "\"I saw her for three years. And then Dr. Landy severed the relationship,\" said Wilson.",
      "And how did he respond to that? \"Negatively,\" he said. \"I said, 'Tat's not fair, Gene. That's not fair.'\"",
      "Melinda recalled Brian telling her, \"I want outta this hellhole.\" And that, she told Mason, gave her all the impetus she needed.",
      "Landy's grip on Wilson was finally broken in 1991, when the family discovered that Brian's will had been revised -- with Landy named as his main beneficiary.",
      "They eventually won a court order barring the therapist from any further contact with his patient. Brian Wilson's nine-year ordeal was over.",
      "Brian and Melinda were married in 1995. They have five adopted children together.",
      "The song \"One Kind of Love,\" on Brian Wilson's new album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" is dedicated to Melinda.  (To hear Wilson perform the song click on the video player below.)",
      "Just driftwood floating on the sea, \tSearching for the me and all that I have known to be. \tThank God that you noticed me, \tAnd brought back harmony to this lonely soul.",
      "Mason asked, \"How important was Melinda in you getting through that?\"",
      "\"Well, she got me bailed out of it,\" Wilson said. \"She got me out of the program. She was my hero.\"",
      "\"He is really strong -- people don't get that about him,\" Melinda said. \"They think he's passive and just sits around. But he's strong.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment when you knew you'd actually won?\"",

      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now urging summer camp operators to check for documentation of immunity from\u00a0measles\u00a0through vaccination or prior infection for all children, staff and volunteers, amid a deadly year of outbreaks that is now near record levels.",
      "\"Measles can spread quickly in summer camps because campers and staff spend a lot of time together in close contact with each other. Measles is more than just a rash \u2014 it can cause serious complications or even death,\" the CDC warned in a \"checklist\" for operators of summer camps published this week.",
      "The agency's new guidance says that tracking measles immunity status is important to help health departments quickly identify people who need to be vaccinated or offered antibody injections in the case of an outbreak within a camp.",
      "\"Decide if you will allow unvaccinated campers and staff at your camp. Understand the risk if you do accept a camper or staff member who has not been immunized for measles,\" the American Camp Association says in its guidance for camps, which shared the CDC's checklist.",
      "Other steps that the CDC recommends summer camps take to prepare for measles spread this year include stocking up on face masks and preparing a potential isolation space to separate campers who are sickened.",
      "The CDC's new recommendations come as confirmed measles cases have climbed to 1,197 infections so far in 2025, less than 100 cases away from topping the record 1,274 cases that were confirmed for all of 2019. That marked a record since the U.S. in 2000 declared uncontrolled community spread of the virus\u00a0eliminated\u00a0through widespread measles vaccinations.",
      "At the time in 2019, health officials said the total number of cases added up to the worst tally on record since the 20th century.",
      "This year's wave is already deadlier than the 2019 wave of outbreaks, which health officials and experts suspect is due to missed infections that have gone unreported.",
      "In 2019, summer camps in New York tightened their vaccination requirements amid record outbreaks in the state among underimmunized communities. In response to the outbreaks, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law\u00a0that year removing religious exemptions from measles vaccination requirements for school and child day care programs.",
      "About two in three confirmed measles cases this year have been in children or teens, according to the CDC's tally. Most have been linked to local outbreaks within the U.S., many from the outbreak in Texas and neighboring states earlier this year.",
      "While new cases around Texas slowed in April, preliminary CDC data from recently reported measles cases \u2014 backdated to when patients' symptoms began \u2014 suggests the pace of new infections nationwide began accelerating again in May.",
      "The agency also recently stepped up its warning about the risk of catching measles while traveling. The new guidance followed dozens of cases of travelers infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S., and a suspected case of spread during air travel, CBS News previously reported.",

    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday he's naming eight new advisers to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, after firing the committee's entire previous roster of 17 advisers.",
      "\"All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations,\" Kennedy said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process for selecting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP. In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",
      "The CDC also removed the career officials tasked with overseeing the committee and its agenda, effectively replacing them with an appointee of the Trump administration.",
      "The panel's influential recommendations are closely watched because they are directly tied to federal policies, like which vaccines insurers are required to cover.",
      "The picks announced by Kennedy include some close allies of the secretary and his inner circle. Several have a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety. Some have ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers. One says he previously invested in a vaccine.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said that Kennedy \"has replaced vaccine groupthink with a diversity of viewpoints\" on the panel and said that ethics agreements would be made public for the new members before they begin work for the ACIP.",
      "\"The speed with which these members were selected, and the lack of transparency in the process, does not help to restore public confidence and trust, and contributes to confusion and uncertainty,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at those named:",
      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "He also previously testified as an expert witness in a lawsuit by a law firm tied to Kennedy against Merck's HPV vaccine Gardasil. Kulldorff was being paid $400 an hour, he said in 2024. Reuters previously reported Kulldorff's work for the firm, WisnerBaum.",
      "During Kennedy's confirmation process, Senate Democrats had accused him of a conflict of interest for his ties to WisnerBaum and its litigation against Merck's vaccine, calling on him to amend his ethics agreement to avoid cashing in on any settlements or judgments from the lawsuit.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",

      "Dr. Kathryn Edwards, who previously worked as the chair of the FDA vaccine panel that Meissner served on, described Meissner as the only person she knew from Kennedy's list with credible experience in pediatric infectious diseases and analyzing the illnesses and deaths prevented by vaccines.",
      "Meissner was previously listed in April as a consultant to the RSV vaccines work group for the CDC committee, before Kennedy fired its advisers.",
      "\"He's a card-carrying infectious disease person who knows the burden of these diseases, and he knows the risk and the benefit. And I think it will be a challenge for him, but obviously, he knows what he's getting into,\" Edwards said.",

      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",

      "In an interview Levi shared on social media after the announcement, he said he would \"keep an open mind,\" but also stood by his previous call for mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna's COVID-19 shots to be suspended.",
      "\"I think it's obvious that these mRNA vaccines should not be given to anybody young or healthy. It is also not at all clear to me that they should be given to anybody, based on the evidence,\" he said.",

The University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy\u00a0previously reported Ross had backed the letter.",
      "\"We oppose this fixation on randomized controlled trials at the expense of other clinical and scientific evidence and urge medical policymakers to restore balance to the practice of medicine,\" the letter said.",

      "A blog and X account with Pagano's name from several years ago wrote about a range of issues, like\u00a0voicing disappointment over Republicans failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but says little about vaccines.",

      "Dr. Joseph Hibbeln",
      "Another Kennedy pick, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, retired from the National Institutes of Health in 2020. His research portfolio previously covered nutritional intake of fatty acids like omega-3. He previously participated in federal panels related to his work, including the federal Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.",
      "Kennedy described him as bringing \"expertise in immune-related outcomes, psychiatric conditions, and evidence-based public health strategies.\"",
      "Hibbeln previously co-authored a study probing whether exposure during pregnancy to mercury was linked to autism, in the wake of now-debunked research that falsely suggested a mercury-based preservative that was previously used in vaccines was causing autism.",
      "They concluded that there was \"no consistent evidence from this study to implicate prenatal exposure to mercury\" in causing autism, and that \"the benefits of nutrients in fish counteract any possible adverse cognitive and behavioral differences\" caused by mercury exposure.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 05:00:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Utilities are racing to build data centers to meet surging demand for AI and other tech services. Ratepayers will pick up the tab, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "New Jersey residents got some bad news earlier this year when the state's public utilities board warned that their electricity bills could surge up to 20% starting on June 1. A key driver in that rate hike: data centers.",
      "The spread of these large-scale computing facilities across the U.S. amid growing demand for artificial intelligence, data storage and other technology services is projected to increase electricity consumption to record highs in the coming years, according to experts.",
      "A report from Schneider Electric, a company that specializes in digital automation and energy management, projects that electricity demand will increase 16% by 2029, mainly due to the proliferation of data centers. Most data centers rely on the nation's electrical grid for energy, meaning it will be Americans ratepayers who pick up the tab, Mark Wolfe, executive director of the\u00a0National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that represents states on energy issues.",
      "\"As utilities race to meet skyrocketing demand from AI and cloud computing, they're building new infrastructure and raising rates, often without transparency or public input,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"That means higher electricity bills for everyday households, while tech companies benefit from sweetheart deals behind closed doors.\"",
      "More data centers, more power",
      "Thousands of data centers now dot the country, with the\u00a0largest concentrations\u00a0in Virginia, California and Texas. The number of data centers in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to a report from Environment America, a network of environmental groups.",
      "It's not just the number of data centers that are expected to rise, but the size. \"The trend has been bigger data centers,\" Dave Turk, the\u00a0former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0\"They tend to be more energy efficient.\"",
      "Spurring that expansion is the rapid growth of \"generative\" AI companies that are consuming vast amounts of electricity to train so-called Large Language Models like ChatGPT and power. AI searches use 10 times more electricity than normal internet searches, according to a\u00a0study from the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\"AI is an increasing part of data centers and certainly responsible for increased electricity demand,\" Turk said.",
      "Data centers, which contain thousands of computer servers, networking gear and other infrastructure, also require power to cool their systems and keep them from overheating.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at asset management firm Apollo Global Management, estimates that data centers will require an additional 18 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. To put that into context, New York City power demand is about 6 gigawatts.",
      "About 4.4% of U.S. electricity went to power data centers in 2023, according to a Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. Not all of that demand is related to AI, but it represents a portion, Turk said.",
      "Other factors pushing up prices",
      "The spread of data centers isn't the only reason U.S. electricity prices are surging. The price of natural gas, inflation, ongoing electrification of buildings and vehicles, and other factors also play an important role. But utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models.",
      "For example, when Dominion Energy, one of the Virginia's largest utilities, in April\u00a0proposed\u00a0a price hike of $8.51 per month in 2026, the company also floated the idea of a \"new rate class for high energy users, including data centers.\"",
      "Electricity prices have risen 4.5% in the last year, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Labor Department, and are estimated to\u00a0surge this summer. Energy costs also drift higher if a Republican-backed budget package, dubbed the \"big beautiful bill,\" is passed and signed into law by President Trump. Analysts from Rhodium Group\u00a0predict\u00a0that the bill, which would repeal a slate of tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, could increase a family's energy expenditures by nearly $400 a year.",
      "Beyond price increases, the heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to experts. In a recent\u00a0report, the North American Electric Reliability Corp said that facilities that service AI and cryptocurrency companies are being developed at a faster pace than the power plants and transmission lines to support them, \"resulting in lower system stability.",
      "PJM, a grid operator in 13 states plus Washington, D.C., cited data center demand as one of the factors that could lead to capacity shortages in its 2025 forecast.",

      "The market slide comes after\u00a0Israel launched strikes\u00a0on Iran's nuclear sites and other targets early Friday, the start of what Israel said could be a days-long attack. Iran responded by launching over 100 drones, which Israel claimed it was able to mostly intercept.",

      "The oil market had an even stronger reaction on Friday, with U.S. benchmark crude oil increasing 7.3% to $72.98. Bent crude, the international standard, climbed 7% to $74.23 for a barrel. A deepening conflict could impact the flow of oil from Iran, a major producer of crude, according to analysts.",

      "Extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic \u2014 which reduced the premiums Muralles and her husband paid by more than half, to $30 a month \u2014 are in place only through Dec. 31. Without enhanced subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise by more than 75% on average, with bills for people in some states more than doubling, according to estimates from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Florida and Texas would be hit especially hard, as they have more people enrolled in the marketplace than other states. Some of their congressional districts alone, especially in South Florida, have more people signed up for Obamacare than entire states.",
      "Like many of the more than 24 million Americans enrolled in the insurance marketplace this year, Muralles was unaware that the enhanced subsidies are slated to expire. She said she cannot afford a premium hike because inflation has already eaten into her household's budget.",
      "\"The rent is going up,\" she said. \"The water bill is going up.\"",
      "Low-income enrollees like the Muralles couple would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums if enhanced subsidies expire.",
      "Middle-income enrollees who earn more than four times the federal poverty line would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Those middle-income enrollees (who earn at least $62,600 for a single person in 2025) are disproportionately older, self-employed, and living in rural areas.",
      "Julio Fuentes, president of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said many of his organization's members are small business owners who rely on Obamacare for health coverage.",
      "\"It's either this or nothing,\" he said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would, by 2034, increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million. In tandem with changes to Medicaid in the House of Representatives' reconciliation bill and the Trump administration's proposed rules for the marketplace, including toughening income verification and shortening enrollment periods, it would increase the number of uninsured people by 16 million over that time period.",
      "A study by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Hispanic and Black people would see greater coverage losses than other groups if the extra subsidies lapse.",
      "Fuentes noted that about 5 million Hispanics are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, and that President Trump won the Hispanic vote in Florida in 2024. He hopes the president and congressional Republicans see extending the enhanced subsidies as a way to hold on to those voters.",
      "\"This is probably a good way, or a good start, to possibly grow that base even more,\" he said.",
      "Enrollment in the marketplace has grown faster since 2020 in the states won by Mr. Trump in 2024. A recent KFF survey found that 45% of Americans who buy their own health insurance identify as or lean Republican, including 3 in 10 who identify as Make America Great Again supporters. Smaller shares identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents (35%) or do not lean toward either party (20%).",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said the rules proposed by the Trump administration, combined with the provisions in the House-passed budget bill, would \"strengthen the ACA marketplace.\" He noted that the CBO projects the legislation would reduce premiums for some plans about 12% on average by 2034 \u2014 but out-of-pocket costs would rise or remain the same for most subsidized ACA consumers.",
      "\"Democrats know Americans broadly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, as The One, Big, Beautiful Bill does, which is why they are desperately trying to change the conversation,\" Desai said.",
      "But Lauren Aronson, executive director of Keep Americans Covered, a group in Washington, D.C., representing health insurers, hospitals, physicians, and patient advocates, said it is critical to raise awareness about the likely impact of losing the enhanced subsidies, which are also known as advanced premium tax credits. She is encouraged that Democrats have proposed legislation to extend the enhanced tax credits, and that some Republican senators have voiced support.",
      "What worries Aronson most is that the Republican-controlled Congress is more focused on extending tax cuts than enhanced subsidies, she said. The current bill extending the 2017 tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO, while making the enhanced subsidies permanent would increase the deficit by $358 billion over roughly the same period.",
      "\"Congress is moving forward on a tax reconciliation package that purports to benefit working families,\" Aronson said. \"But if you don't take care of the tax credits, working families will be left holding the bag.\"",
      "Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health policy think tank, said the enhanced subsidies were supposed to be a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people at risk of losing coverage.",
      "Instead, he said, the enhanced subsidies facilitated fraud because enrollees did not need to verify their income eligibility to receive zero-premium plans if they reported incomes at or near the federal poverty level.",
      "The enhanced subsidies also worsen health inflation, discourage employers from offering health insurance benefits, and crowd out alternative models, such as short-term insurance and Farm Bureau plans, Blase said.",
      "\"Permitting these subsidies to expire would just be going back to Obamacare as it was written,\" Blase said. \"That is a more efficient program than the program that we have now.\"",
      "New rules for the marketplace proposed by the Trump administration in March are already designed to address fraud, said Anna Howard, a policy expert with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which advocates for increased health insurance coverage. Howard said extending the enhanced tax credits would help ensure that people who are legitimately eligible for coverage can get it.",
      "\"We don't want to see over 5 million people be kicked off their health insurance coverage out of fears of fraud when the policies being proposed don't necessarily address fraud,\" she said.",
      "Without affordable premiums, many consumers will turn to short-term health plans, health care cost-sharing ministries, and other forms of coverage that do not have the benefits or protections of the health law, she said.",
      "\"These are plans that don't provide coverage for prescription drugs, or they have lifetime and annual limits,\" she said. \"For a cancer patient, those plans don't work.\"",
      "Though the enhanced subsidies do not expire until the end of the year, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would prefer Congress to act by fall to avoid confusion during open enrollment, said David Merritt, a senior vice president. Insurers are preparing rates to meet state deadlines. By October, consumers will receive 60-day plan renewal notices with their 2026 premiums.",
      "Without enhanced subsidies, Merritt said, competition in the marketplace will wither, leading to fewer coverage options and higher prices, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility and where Obamacare enrollment spiked during the past four years, like Florida and Texas. \"Voters and patients are really going to see the impact,\" he said.",
      "Republican and Democratic representatives for some of the Florida congressional districts with the highest numbers of people in the marketplace did not respond to repeated interview requests.",
      "Muralles, of North Miami, Florida, said she wants her representatives to work in the interest of constituents like herself, who need health insurance coverage to care for their families.",
      "\"Now is the time to prove to us that they are with us,\" Muralles said. \"When everybody's healthy, everybody goes to work, everybody can pay taxes, everybody can have a better life.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Air India plane crash on Thursday is putting a renewed spotlight on Boeing, the manufacturer of the 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft that crashed in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad with 242 passengers and crew on board.",
      "Boeing says the 787-8 is the aviation industry's \"best-selling passenger widebody of all time,\" carrying more than 1 billion passengers since it was first delivered to airlines in 2011.",
      "What caused the crash remains unclear, and the 787-8 Dreamliner has generally had a good safety record. U.S. safety officials said they are heading to India to assist in the investigation of the accident. A senior Indian police official told the country's national news agency, ANI, that one\u00a0person survived the crash.",
      "\"The NTSB will be leading a team of U.S. investigators travelling to India to assist the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau with its investigation into the crash of an Air India Boeing 787 in Ahmedabad, India, Thursday,\" the National Transportation Safety Board said in a social media post.",
      "In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said the local government leads an investigation when it occurs in that country. \"In the event assistance is requested, the NTSB is the official U.S. representative and the FAA provides technical support. We stand ready to launch a team immediately in coordination with the NTSB,\" the agency said.",
      "Boeing said it is in contact with Air India about the crash and stands \"ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected.\"",
      "Shares of Boeing fell $10.32, or 4.8%, to $203.59 in early trading.",
      "First crash of a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner",
      "The Air India incident represents the first crash of a 787-8 Dreamliner, although the aircraft has been involved in previous investigations.",
      "The aircraft was designed by Boeing to handle longer nonstop routes, which the company says had opened up 425 new routes around the world since the aircraft was introduced.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration last year ordered inspections of the cockpit seats on the Dreamliners after one of the jets went into a dive when the captain's seat lurched forward without warning and disconnected the plane's autopilot system, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Last year, a whistleblower's allegations prompted the FAA to investigate his claims about assembly defects in the company's 787 Dreamliner.",
      "Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer, said \"he observed shortcuts taken by Boeing\" during assembly of the Dreamliner, \"resulting in drilling debris left in interfaces and deformation of composite material,\" CBS News reported. He also claimed to have witnessed issues with the 777 assembly process, according to a letter sent by Salehpour's lawyers to the FAA last year.",
      "For now, it is unclear if those reported issues are linked in any way to the Air India crash.",
      "The Dreamliner in the Air India crash",
      "The aircraft involved in the Air India crash was first delivered to the airline in January 2014. It was on its way from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad to London's Gatwick airport when it crashed shortly after its departure.",
      "The plane had logged more than 41,000 hours of flying time, with almost 8,000 takeoffs and landings, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Air India operates 190 aircraft, with an average age of 8.4 years, Cirium said.",
      "There are more than 1,100 Dreamliners operating across the globe today, with the aircraft having been in operation for an average of 7.5 years, Cirium noted.",
      "Air India said there was a \"sole survivor\" of the crash who was being treated at a hospital.",
      "\"The aircraft crashed shortly after take-off. We regret to inform that, of the 242 aboard, there are 241 confirmed fatalities. The sole survivor is being treated in a hospital,\" the airline\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement Thursday on social media.",
      "Other Boeing safety issues",
      "The incident comes after a string of safety issues for Boeing, which has faced investigations and lawsuits for two crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners that killed a total of 346 people. A January incident in which a door plug fell off a 737 Max 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines in January of 2024 fueled further concerns.",
      "Boeing posted a 2024 loss of $11.8 billion, bringing its total losses since 2019 to more than $35 billion.",
      "In May, the aircraft manufacturer\u00a0reached a $1.1 billion deal\u00a0with the Department of Justice that allows it to avoid prosecution for the crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019.",
      "An April 2025 analysis of commercial jet safety from Boeing shows that the airline industry has improved its overall safety record over the past several decades, although there was an increase in accidents in 2024. According to the report, there were 47 accidents last year across the airline industry, including 12 hull losses, and 187 fatalities.",

    "story": [
      "Americans often voice frustration\u00a0over the ubiquity of tipping these days, but that hasn't stopped them from giving generously to reward good service.",
      "Consumers spent an estimated $77.6 billion on tips for food purchased at restaurants, bars and other eateries in 2023, according to a new study by LendingTree. The analysis, which draws on the most recent government data available, gives readers a snapshot of how much Americans tip and in which states they tip the most.",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, LendingTree found that tipping rates tend to be higher in states where people eat out more. LendingTree also looked at which Americans around the country drop the biggest tips.",
      "Where do people tip the most?",
      "New Hampshire residents are the No. 1 tippers in the country, according to the LendingTree study. On average, they leave a gratuity of 16.07% of spending on food away from home \u2014 falling within the standard range of 15% to 20% tips at restaurants. New Hampshire's average tipping rate is four times that of the nation's lowest tipping state, which is Utah at 4.09%.",
      "But that's not to say Utah residents are stingy. As LendingTree points out, average tipping rates hinge on how much people in each state spend on food outside the home \u2014 that includes full-service restaurants as well as fast-food place and even vending machines. In other words, not all food that's consumed outside the home is purchased at establishments where tipping is common.",
      "\"If people in one state tend to dine at full-service restaurants far more often than those in another state, it stands to reason their overall percentage spent on tips would be higher,\" LendingTree Chief Consumer Financial Analyst Matt Schulz wrote in the study.",
      "After New Hampshire, residents of Washington, D.C., are the nation's biggest tippers. People in the U.S. capital on average tip 12.65% when eating out.",

Typically as we move into summer, demand for eggs soften as people shift to consuming more meat and grilling outdoors,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People aren't making heavy breakfasts, so we don't see demand for eggs being as strong as it typically is during the winter months.\"",
      "While egg prices have declined for two consecutive months, down from $6.23 a dozen in March, they remain elevated compared with 12 months ago. In May 2024, a dozen eggs cost $2.70.",
      "David Ortega, a food economics professor at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch that containing avian flu explains most of the drop in egg prices.",
      "\"This is primarily due to a reduction in the number of commercial facilities that have been impacted by the bird flu,\" he said. \"A lot of bird flu activity in the beginning of the year led to a significant surge in egg prices, but those impacts have really lessened over the past couple of months.\"",

Officials said he was found hiding in the woods near his home in Green Isle, in Sibley County. He is facing murder charges for the killing of the Hortmans and attempted murder charges for the shootings of the Hoffmans.",
      "Boelter served on a state board with Hoffman for more than six years, records show, and authorities investigating the shootings have now said they're looking into whether the suspect knew Hoffman or Hortman personally. Authorities found his car on Sunday,\u00a0CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "Here's what officials have said about the targeted attacks.",
      "What happened at the homes of Minnesota lawmakers?",
      "Police first responded to a call of a shooting at Hoffman's home in Champlin at around 2 a.m. local time Saturday, Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said in the briefing. Life-saving measures were provided to Hoffman and his wife and they were taken to an area hospital, where they underwent surgery to treat gunshot wounds, Evans said.",
      "Nine bullets hit Sen. Hoffman and eight struck his wife, Yvette, and they were both \"lucky to be alive,\" Yvette Hoffman told Sen. Amy Klobuchar in a text message on Sunday.",

John is enduring many surgeries right now anvd is closer every hour to being out of the woods,\" she wrote, in part. \"We are gutted and devastated by the loss of Melissa and Mark. We have no words. There is never a place for this kind of political hate.\"",
      "After authorities learned of the shooting at the Hoffman property, Brooklyn Park police went proactively to Hortman's home, Police Chief Mark Bruley said. Hortman's home is about five miles from Hoffman's.",
      "Two Brooklyn Park police officers who went to Hortman's home saw what appeared to be a police vehicle parked in front of the house with its emergency lights on, and a police officer leaving the house, Bruley said. The vehicle \"looked exactly like an SUV squad car,\" equipped with emergency lights, Bruley said. The individual was wearing a vest with a Taser, badge and other equipment, Bruley said. Bruley said the individual appeared to have knocked on the door of the home.",
      "The Brooklyn Park officers confronted the individual, who Burley said \"immediately\" fired and exchanged gunshots with officers, Bruley said. The individual then retreated into the home, Bruley said. The police officers then entered the home and saw that Hortman's husband had been shot. They attempted to render first aid, but he was pronounced dead. A drone was then used to search the rest of the home and found Hortman dead inside.",
      "Bruley said the individual was \"clearly\" impersonating a police officer and had used \"the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.\" Doorbell camera footage from the home of one of the victims showed the suspect appearing to be wearing a mask.",
      "A search of the individual's vehicle found a document that named other lawmakers and officials, Bruley said. Evans said both Hoffman and Hortman were included on the list but he did not elaborate on any other names.",
      "A stack of \"No Kings\" flyers was also found inside the vehicle, the Minnesota State Patrol said on social media. The flyers reference the anti-Trump protests that took place\u00a0in cities nationwide on Saturday. After the shooting, statewide \"No Kings\" events planned for Minnesota were canceled. Law enforcement appeared concerned the suspect was planning to target the protests, and the Minnesota State Patrol asked that people planning to attend the events avoid them out of an abundance of caution.",

He was arrested near his home in Green Isle, Sibley County, on Sunday night, sources told CBS News. Multiple local police and sheriff departments, along with state and federal agencies were involved in the nearly 43-hour-long manhunt.",
      "Investigators had been searching in the area after a vehicle belonging to Boelter was found. Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said that one officer thought he saw Boelter run into the woods and a large perimeter was set up. Investigators later got further information that Boelter had been seen in the woods, and multiple SWAT teams were called in, according to Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendant Drew Evans and Bruley. After authorities closed in on Boelter, he \"crawled to law enforcement teams,\" according to Minnesota State Patrol Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger.",

      "Boelter is\u00a0listed\u00a0as director of security patrols on the website of Praetorian Guard Security Services, where his wife is named president and CEO. However, Boelter's roommate told CBS News that, while it was the suspect's \"dream\" to have his own security company, he did not actually have one.",
      "\"It seems he bought the two cars for the security company, but he had no clients and he had no business,\" the roommate told CBS News. \"He had no employees and wasn't doing any security for anyone.\"",

In an undated video posted online, he\u00a0said\u00a0that while working to develop projects in Congo, he started working at Minnesota funeral homes \"to help pay the bills.\"",

Walz reappointed him that year as a business member, a position he held until January 2023.",

      "The board advises the governor and legislature on policies aimed at strengthening Minnesota's workforce and improving its competitiveness, according to its\u00a0website.",
      "Boelter's roommate, in response to rumors circulating online about the suspect's politics, told CBS News, \"He's not a Democrat. He would be offended if people called him a Democrat,\" adding that Boelter \"was a Trump supporter, voted for Trump,\" and was happy President Trump won the 2024 election.",
      "In a news conference Saturday, authorities said they were investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman.",
      "Evans said there is \"certainly some overlap with some public meetings\" between Hoffman and Boelter, but that they had not determined \"the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn on the day of the 2018 midterm elections, Boelter\u00a0posted about the importance of voting in elections.",

      "Hortman, 55, represented Minnesota House District 34B. She was the top House Democratic leader in the state Legislature and a former House speaker. A lawyer, Hortman was first elected to office in 2004. She and her husband, John, have two children, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Walz called the deaths of Hortman and her husband \"a political assassination.\" In a later statement, Walz said that Minnesota had lost a \"great leader\" and that he had \"lost a friend.\"",
      "\"A formidable public servant and a fixture of the state Capitol, Melissa Hortman woke up every day determined to make our state a better place. She served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, and tirelessness,\" Walz said.",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin, who was the chair of the state Democratic Party in Minnesota for 14 years, said Hortman was a \"close friend\" whom he had known since the start of his political career.",
      "\"As I said many times when I introduced her at events, she is the very best Speaker of the House that Minnesota has ever had,\" Martin said.",
      "Until Hortman was killed, the Minnesota state House was evenly divided 67-67. In the state Senate, Democrats hold a one-seat majority.",
      "Who is State Sen. John Hoffman?",
      "Hoffman, 60, a Democrat who represents Minnesota Senate District 34, which covers a swath of northwest Twin Cities suburbs. He was first elected in 2012 and has been reelected three times.",

      "He and his wife Yvette were each shot multiple times, Walz said. They are out of surgery and are receiving care, Walz said. He added that his \"prayers are with\" the couple.",
      "On Sunday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u00a0shared\u00a0a text message she received from Yvette Hoffman, which said, \"Our family is so humbled by the love and outpouring from everyone.\"",
      "\"John is enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,\" she wrote. \"...We are incredibly lucky to be alive. We are gutted and devastated by the loss of Melissa and Mark. We have no words. There is never a place for this kind of political hate.\"",
      "John Hoffman got out of his final surgery and was \"moving toward recovery\" Sunday night, Walz said.",
      "The Hoffmans have one daughter. The Hoffmans' nephew said Yvette Hoffman jumped on their daughter, Hope, to\u00a0shield her\u00a0from the gunfire.",
      "Officials denounce political violence",
      "Gov. Walz said Americans \"don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,\" and emphasized that the shootings followed a special session where both sides compromised for the good of Minnesota.",
      "\"In the state of Minnesota, and as recently as last week, in the most closely divided state legislature in the country, we sat down, shook hands and compromised, and we served the state of Minnesota together,\" Walz said. \"It's possible in politically charged times to find compromise, democracy and civil discourse. I, Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence.\"",
      "Walz also thanked the responding officers, who he said showed \"bravery and swift action.\"",
      "\"We will spare no resource in bringing those responsible to justice. We will not let fear win,\" Walz said.",
      "President Trump said in a statement that he had been briefed on the \"terrible shooting.\" He said Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI are investigating the situation and would prosecute anyone involved \"to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "\"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\"",
      "Sen. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, and Rep. Tom Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, responded to the shootings in a joint statement issued alongside all members of the Minnesota Congressional Delegation.",
      "\"Today we speak with one voice to express our outrage, grief, and condemnation of this horrible attack on public servants,\" the statement said. \"There is no place in our democracy for politically-motivated violence. We are praying for John and Yvette's recovery and we grieve the loss of Melissa and Mark with their family, colleagues, and Minnesotans across the state. We are grateful for law enforcement's swift response to the situation and continued efforts.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he has asked Capitol Police to increase security for both Minnesota senators, Klobuchar and Tina Smith. Schumer also said he has asked Senate Sergeant at Arms Jennifer Hemingway and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to convene a full briefing as soon as senators return to Washington.",
      "\"As we continue to follow this terrifying situation, I urge everyone to stay safe, stay vigilant, and reject political violence in all its forms,\" Schumer said. \"But condemning violence while ignoring what fuels it is not enough. We must confront the toxic forces radicalizing individuals and we must do more to protect one another, our democracy, and the values that bind us as Americans.\"",
      "Former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona, who was shot in the head in 2011 at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona, in an assassination attempt by a lone gunman that killed six people and wounded 12 others, said in a statement Saturday that she was \"horrified and heartbroken\" by the shootings.",
      "\"My family and I know the horror of a targeted shooting all too well,\" said Giffords, who is married to Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. \"An attack against lawmakers is an attack on American democracy itself. Leaders must speak out and condemn the fomenting violent extremism that threatens everything this country stands for.\"",

      "Israel and Iran traded more missile attacks Sunday despite calls for a halt to the fighting, with neither country backing down as their conflict raged for a third day. The exchange of fire comes as talks on Iran's nuclear program in Oman between the U.S. and Iran were called off.",
      "Iran said Israel struck its oil refineries, killed the intelligence chief of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and hit population centers in intensive aerial attacks that raised the death toll in the country since Israel launched its major campaign Friday to 224 people. Health authorities also reported that 1,277 were wounded, without distinguishing between military officials and civilians.",
      "Israel \u2014 widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East \u2014 has aimed its missiles at Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program and military leadership. Israel said Iran has fired over 270 missiles since Friday, 22 of which had slipped through the country's sophisticated multi-tiered air defenses as of Sunday and caused havoc in residential suburbs, killing 14 people and wounding 390 others.",

      "In Israel, at least 10 people were killed in Iranian strikes overnight and into Sunday, according to Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service. It brought the country's total death toll to 14, including a 10-year-old and a 9-year-old in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv, since the strikes began on Friday night.",
      "Israel's defense minister warned Saturday that \"Tehran will burn\" if Iran continues firing missiles at Israel.",

      "But Israeli strikes have increasingly extended beyond Iranian military installations to hit government buildings including the Foreign Ministry and several energy facilities, Iranian authorities said, most recently sparking huge fires at the Shahran oil depot north of Tehran and a fuel tank south of the city.",

      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has made the destruction of Iran's nuclear program his top priority, brushed off urgent calls from world leaders to de-escalate, saying Israel's strikes so far are \"nothing compared to what they will feel under the sway of our forces in the coming days.\"",
      "Israel's initial assault used warplanes \u2014 as well as drones smuggled into the country in advance, according to officials \u2014 to hit key facilities and kill top generals and scientists.",
      "\"The individuals who were eliminated played a central part of the progress toward nuclear weapons,\" the IDF said in a news release. \"Their elimination represents a significant blow to the Iranian regime's ability to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\"",
      "Iran retaliated by launching waves of drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, where explosions lit the night skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and shook the buildings below. The Israeli military urged civilians, already rattled by 20 months of war in Gaza sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, to head to shelter for hours. U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News that U.S. forces helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles on Friday.",

      "A senior administration official told CBS News, \"While there will be no meeting Sunday, we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon.\"",
      "Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, said Saturday that the nuclear talks were \"unjustifiable\" after Israel's strikes, which he said were the \"result of the direct support by Washington.\"",
      "President Trump, who has expressed full support for Israel's actions, offered a stark warning to Iran against retaliating against U.S. targets in the Middle East. He also predicted Israel and Iran would \"soon\" make a deal to end their escalating conflict.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social account early Sunday, Mr. Trump reiterated that the U.S. was not involved in the attacks on Iran and warned that any retaliation directed against it would bring an American response \"at levels never seen before.\"",
      "\"However, we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!\" he wrote.",
      "Hours later, Mr. Trump took to social media again to predict, \"Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal.\"",
      "The president claimed he has built a track record for de-escalating conflicts, and that he would get Israel and Iran to cease hostilities \"just like I got India and Pakistan to make\" after the two countries' recent cross-border confrontation.",
      "Mr. Trump also pointed to efforts by his administration during his first term to mediate disputes between Serbia and Kosovo and Egypt and Ethiopia.",
      "\"Likewise, we will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran!\" he wrote. \"Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that's OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "One of Mr. Trump's allies in the senate, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday morning that Mr. Trump \"sent a clear message to the Ayatollahs, that if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the U.S. military in a way no one's ever seen.\"",
      "Above-ground section of Natanz facility destroyed",
      "Among the key sites Israel attacked was Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, where black smoke could be seen rising into the air. It also appeared to strike a second, smaller nuclear enrichment facility in Fordo, about 60 miles southeast of Tehran, according to an Iranian news outlet close to the government that reported hearing explosions nearby.",
      "Israel said it also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan, and said it destroyed dozens of radar installations and surface-to-air missile launchers in western Iran. Iran confirmed the strike at Isfahan.",
      "U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told the Security Council that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground did not appear to have been hit, but the loss of power could have damaged the infrastructure there, he said.",
      "Israel also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The International Atomic Energy Agency said four \"critical buildings\" were damaged, including its uranium conversion facility. It said there was no sign of increased radiation at Natanz or Isfahan.",
      "An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with official procedures, said that according to the army's initial assessment, \"it will take much more than a few weeks\" for Iran to repair the damage to the Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites. The official said the army had \"concrete intelligence that production in Isfahan was for military purposes.\"",
      "On \"Face the Nation,\" Cotton said Iran is \"close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons,\" and that's why both Mr. Trump and Netanyahu thought \"things were coming to a head\" with Thursday night's launch.",
      "\"A second reason is Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium range to target Israel, and short range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month,\" Cotton added. \"And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.\"",

    "story": [
      "Surveillance camera footage from the lobby of a building down the street from the U.S. Capitol provided a break in the three-year search for the person who was extorting a young man from Buffalo, New York.",
      "Cross Cole, a 21-year-old citizen of Ghana, who is linked to a 2022 stay at a rental property in Washington, D.C., was charged last week with the sextortion scheme.",
      "Cole's arrest is part of a growing wave of such cases nationwide and illustrates the complicated and international nature of these attacks.",
      "Sextortion, in which schemers threaten to release illicit photos of victims unless the victims pay them, has surged nationwide.",
      "An FBI affidavit reviewed by CBS News said Cole had obtained a naked photo of the victim from years earlier, when the victim was a minor. Prosecutors also alleged Cole had accessed a nude image of the victim's friend, while the friend was also a minor. The victim's email account was hacked, and his social media account security was compromised, federal prosecutors said.",
      "\"The victim sent $200 to the CashApp account but cancelled the payment after speaking with his father,\" Michael Digiacomo, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York, said in a public notice about the case. \"He then continued to receive multiple text messages from the same telephone number that made the threats.\"",
      "The affidavit reviewed by CBS News said agents eventually tracked down an IP address linked to Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., that had accessed the victim's account in October 2022. A security camera image in the affidavit allegedly shows Cole entering an AirBNB rental facility at the Capitol Hill address in October 2022.",
      "The affidavit said Cole's\u00a0mother, who is also a citizen of Ghana, had rented a space in the building through AirBNB that month. A judge has ordered Cole to be detained, pending trial. His next court hearing is scheduled for September in Buffalo federal court.",
      "Safety experts and federal law enforcement officials told CBS News that a growing number of these sextortion schemes are being executed by foreign nationals against children and young adults in the U.S. FBI records obtained by CBS News show a nearly 500% increase in reports of sextortion since 2019.",
      "The FBI and safety groups have been trying to raise awareness around cases like Cole's. Targets are increasingly young men. Experts say these victims are less likely to report the incidents.",
      "In some of the newest wave of sextortion cases, schemers lure children and young adults into sharing illicit photos by pretending to be someone who's about the same age. In other cases, including the one described in the charging documents against Cole, suspects are accused of hacking into the social media accounts of victims to obtain the illicit images.",
      "\"These cases are like something we've never seen before,\" said Lauren Coffen, director of the Exploited Children Division at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.",
      "\"We are used to people being able to reach out and engage and chat with children for sexual reasons. They wanted the images, they wanted to be able to maybe meet up,\" Coffen told CBS News. \"Now, they want money. And that's a totally different motivator than what we're used to seeing in exploitation.\"",
      "\"People have no idea how targeted our teenage boys are right now,\" Pauline Stuart told CBS News.",
      "Stuart's son, Ryan Last, died by suicide hours after a sextortion scheme was threatened against him in 2022. The Justice Department says Last's death showed the pervasiveness of international criminals in sextortion schemes. In an announcement in May, the department said four men in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire had been arrested on criminal charges related to their alleged role in an international sextortion scheme that targeted thousands of victims, including Last.",
      "\"The sad reality is this is not an uncommon event,\" said Digiacomo, whose office is prosecuting Cole's case. Though he would not comment on the details of the Cole investigation, Digiacomo said the pervasiveness of sextortion cases is troubling and largely unrecognized by some parents.",
      "\"Oftentimes in these cases, there are very young victims,\" Digiacomo told CBS News, \"The perpetrators will say 'Just send me the pictures and I'll leave you alone.' And the victims think (sending money) is the easy way out or the only way out.\"",
      "Digiacomo and the National Center for Missing Exploited Children both told CBS News that the international component of the conspiracies complicates efforts to track down and stop sextorters.",

    "summary": "Cities large and small across the U.S. saw crowds gather Saturday for planned \"No Kings\" protests against President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Demonstrators crowded into streets, parks and plazas across the U.S. on Saturday to protest President Trump, marching through downtowns and blaring anti-authoritarian chants mixed with support for protecting democracy and immigrant rights.",
      "Organizers of the \"No Kings\" demonstrations said millions had marched in hundreds of events. Governors across the U.S. had urged calm and vowed no tolerance for violence, while some mobilized the National Guard ahead of marchers gathering. Confrontations were isolated.",
      "But one person was transported to a Salt Lake City hospital Saturday night with life-threatening injuries after a shooting during that city's protest, officials said. Salt Lake City police said the shooting was \"possibly associated with the demonstration.\"",
      "Huge, boisterous crowds marched in New York, Denver, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles, some behind \"no kings\" banners.",
      "Thousands of protesters across L.A. \u2014 where demonstrations have occurred in the past week over immigration raids \u2014 were largely peaceful throughout the day, but police issued a dispersal order near the city's downtown federal building after the crowd allegedly started throwing objects at officers.",
      "Police deployed smoke and ordered everyone to leave the area at roughly 3:55 p.m. local time. Aerial footage shows officers detaining several people, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "The gatherings were timed for the same day Mr. Trump will be attending a\u00a0military parade\u00a0in Washington, D.C., to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, and amid heightened tensions with National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to counter anti-ICE protests there.",
      "Saturday morning, Minnesota officials canceled all of the state's \"No Kings\" protests after\u00a0Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman\u00a0and her husband were killed and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded in politically motivated shootings targeting the Democratic lawmakers overnight. Police said they found \"No Kings\" fliers and a list of other potential targets in the suspect's vehicle.",
      "In Texas, state legislators received a \"credible threat\" against them ahead of the planned protest at the state capitol building in Austin, the state's Department of Public Safety said. A suspect was later arrested.",
      "In other cities around the country, protests began as scheduled.",
      "Atlanta's 5,000-capacity event quickly reached its limit, with thousands more gathered outside barriers to hear speakers in front of the state Capitol.",
      "Light rain fell as marchers gathered for the flagship rally in Philadelphia. They shouted \"Whose streets? Our streets!\" as they marched to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where they listened to speakers on the steps made famous in the movie \"Rocky.\"",
      "\"So what do you say, Philly?\" Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland shouted to the crowd. \"Are you ready to fight back? Do you want a gangster state or do you want free speech in America?\"",
      "An estimated tens of thousands joined the \"No Kings\" demonstrations throughout Portland, Oregon, according to Portland police, but hours later, the city's police\u00a0declared a riot for several hours during a protest outside the ICE building. Portland police said in a release early Sunday that three people were arrested near the ICE facility for \"criminal actions, and not constitutionally protected free speech.\"",
      "The demonstrations come on the heels of protests flaring up around the country over federal immigration enforcement raids that ramped up last week, with Mr. Trump ordering National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles as some protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire.",
      "Democratic governors called Mr. Trump's Guard deployment \"an alarming abuse of power\" that \"shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement.\"",
      "Governors and city officials vowed to protect the right to protest and to show no tolerance for violence.",
      "\"New Yorkers may have different emotions right now,\" said New York City Mayor Eric Adams in a briefing on Friday. \"And they have a right to express that, \u00a0but we want to be clear you do not have a right to engage in violence and lawlessness.\"",
      "New York City expected hundreds of thousands of demonstrators to turn out, with multiple protests planned around the area, organizers said.",
      "Though no major demonstration was expected in Washington, D.C., where the\u00a0military parade\u00a0will take place on what is also Mr. Trump's 79th birthday, some protesters gathered Saturday in Lafayette Square, across from the White House.",
      "What is No Kings Day?",
      "The \"No Kings\" theme was orchestrated by the\u00a050501 Movement, to support democracy and against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration. The name 50501 stands for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement.",
      "Protesters have called for Mr. Trump to be \"dethroned\" as they compare his actions to those of a king and not a democratically elected president.",
      "According to a statement by the organizers, the No Kings Day of Defiance is intended to reject authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics and the militarization of the country's democracy.",
      "The event was promoted by Walmart heiress Christy Walton, herself a billionaire, in a full-page advertisement she took out in The New York Times last Sunday. No Kings Day merchandise has cropped up for sale on Amazon, Temu and other online retailers.",
      "Organizers timed the protests to counter the Army's 250th anniversary celebration, which included a military parade involving hundreds of military vehicles and aircraft and thousands of soldiers. The parade has been estimated to cost between $25 million to $45 million, The Army expected the parade to attract as many as 200,000 people.",
      "\"The flag doesn't belong to President Trump. It belongs to us,\" the \"No Kings\" website says. \"On June 14th, we're showing up everywhere he isn't \u2014 to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.\"",
      "The group says a core principle behind all \"No Kings\" events was a commitment to nonviolent action, and organizers urged participants to seek to de-escalate any confrontation.",
      "Organizers said the No Kings Day of Defiance is expected to be the largest single-day mobilization since Mr. Trump returned to office. They said they were preparing for millions of people to take to the streets across all 50 states.",
      "Some states prepare National Guard troops",
      "Republican governors in Virginia, Texas, Nebraska and Missouri are mobilizing National Guard troops to help law enforcement manage demonstrations.",
      "There will be \"zero tolerance\" for violence, destruction or disrupting traffic, and \"if you violate the law, you're going to be arrested,\" Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin told reporters Friday.",
      "In Missouri, Gov. Mike Kehoe issued a similar message, vowing to take a proactive approach and not to \"wait for chaos to ensue.\"",
      "Nebraska's governor on Friday also signed an emergency proclamation for activating his state's National Guard, a step his office called \"a precautionary measure in reaction to recent instances of civil unrest across the country.\"",
      "Organizers say that one march would go to the gates of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis warned demonstrators that the \"line is very clear\" and not to cross it. Another demonstration is set for Fort Lauderdale. Organizers told CBS News Miami they had hundreds of people registered for the event.",
      "Some law enforcement agencies announced they were ramping up efforts for the weekend. In California, state troopers will be on \"tactical alert,\" which means all days off are canceled for all officers.",
      "Governors also urged calm.",
      "On social media, Washington state Governor Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, called for peaceful protests over the weekend, to ensure Trump doesn't send military to the state.",
      "\"Donald Trump wants to be able to say that we cannot handle our own public safety in Washington state,\" Ferguson said.",
      "Multiple rallies were\u00a0planned for Maryland. Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said multiple departments and agencies have \"been carefully monitoring\" the upcoming events, and that \"safety is our highest priority.\"",
      "\"The ability to freely speak out and assemble is a cornerstone of American democracy\u2014and one of our greatest heirlooms as a state and nation,\" Moore said, adding that Maryland is \"a state that will protect the rights of the people and also uphold the law.\"",
      "In a statement Friday, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, urged \"protestors to remain peaceful and calm as they exercise their First Amendment right to make their voices heard.\"",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, also a Democrat, said his administration and state police are working with police in Philadelphia ahead of what organizers estimated could be a crowd approaching 100,000 people.",
      "Philadelphia's top prosecutor, District Attorney Larry Krasner, warned that anyone coming to the city to break the law will face arrest. He invoked civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as a guide for demonstrators.",
      "\"If you are doing what Martin Luther King would have done, you're going to be fine,\" Krasner told a news conference. He also warned against immigration agents exceeding their authority.",
      "Protest organizer Dani Negrete told CBS News Philadelphia that the \"number one priority is making sure that all of these events\" are \"well organized and peaceful.\"",
      "\"We've been making sure that all of our attendees and organizers know why they're here,\" Negrete said. \"Here in Philadelphia, we're going to have a clear message that rings out across the world about the importance of this moment and the importance of standing up while our right to do that is under threat.\"",

    "summary": "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 15, 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 15, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now in Washington by Senator Tom Cotton, who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Good morning and Happy Father's Day to you.",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know you are staying on top of all these events. When it comes to what President Trump has said publicly, he seems to be indicating not just that the U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, but he's saying this is not America's fight, unless Iran hits the U.S. Should it be such a bright line?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, what the President said in his overnight post was a clear message to the Ayatollahs, that if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the US military in a way no one's ever seen. That's a clear deterrent message, setting aside the threat that the nuclear program poses to Israel and to the United States, because let's remember, the Iranian regime has been terrorizing Americans. It's killed thousands of Americans. It's taken them hostage. It still chants \"death to America,\" it's building missiles that can strike not just our troops or our friends in the region, but soon enough here in the United States as well. And that's why President Trump has been consistent for his 10 years in political life that we cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. We cannot allow them to have a path to a nuclear weapon with uranium enrichment. That's the deal that he was trying to negotiate for the last two months. But as he said early last week, Iran was simply too stubborn. They weren't willing to come to the table and negotiate. And I have to disagree with the reporter who said that Israel strikes in Iran ended those negotiations. It was Iran's- Iran's stubbornness that ended them. President Trump was clear about that, and he is still clear that there is time if they want to come back to negotiate an end to the uranium enrichment program, that he would accept that. But he's given them chance after chance, as he said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the line, he's drawing on military force, should the U.S. involvement be purely defensive and deterrent, or should the U.S. be willing to be engaged in these military operations?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, I don't think he's drawn that line. He's been very clear that all options remain on the table to defend our own people, to support Israel--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He hasn't said that--",
      "SEN. COTTON: But he- well, he said that for 10 years, and he said it for months leading up to this moment. He said that Iran can make a deal and live happily without death or there will be bombing. So, I think he's appropriately kept all options on the table. He made clear in the early days of this conflict, on Thursday night and Friday morning, that we back Israel to the hilt. There's almost 700,000 Americans in Israel at any time. So of course, we're going to protect Israel, and that we have the best military technology in the world. And he said that he has proudly provided Israel with those weapons, both in his first term and in this term as well. So, we back Israel to the hilt all the way. But he's appropriately keeping all options on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's emphasizing again and again, this isn't us. This isn't America. This isn't an American operation.",
      "SEN. COTTON: So far in this operation, we have not been involved in offensive strikes. We've been involved in other ways, through our provision of Israel with weapons over the years, or our defense of Israel and its citizens and our citizens in Israel. Now he has said his objective remains the same, which is Iran's nuclear disarmament, and he has said that that can happen still through a deal, I don't think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --He prefers diplomacy.",
      "SEN. COTTON: And he would like Iran to come back to the table. I think now that Iran sees that Israel and America mean business and surrender its enrichment capabilities voluntarily. If that doesn't happen, though, I think the strikes are going to continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to the point, if it's really about destroying the nuclear program that Iran has, you know this very well, that there's this underground facility at Fordow, very deep, under a mountain. It's long been assessed that only the U.S. has the capability with a bunker buster bomb to take it out. Should the United States offer that kind of massive ordnance penetrator to Israel to finish the job?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, I'm not going to speculate about the methods that the United States or Israel might use--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But should they?--",
      "SEN. COTTON: --to protect our own interests. I'll simply say this, it is, as you say, widely known that Israel does not have heavy bombers. It doesn't have those 30,000 pound penetrating munitions. But as we saw with Hezbollah last fall, as we saw in Iran on Thursday night, when the Mossad had infiltrated officers and agents and manufactured drones in Iran, Israel has more than a few tricks up their sleeve, and I wouldn't be surprised if Israel has other cards yet to play.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when it comes to differences in intelligence assessments, the U.S. intelligence that was made public in March said at the time the U.S. does not assess Iran's building a nuclear weapon, and that the supreme leader has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended back in 2003. Was there more recent US intel sharing or intel indicating that there was some kind of sprint for a bomb? Because that seems a very different assessment from what Israel's claiming.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, unfortunately, Iran enriched a lot of the uranium to near weapons-grade over the four years of the Biden administration--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But that's not weaponization, you know that--",
      "SEN. COTTON: -- They are- they are close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons. Now that's not the only step to having a weapon. You also have to have the weapon design. We've seen indications that Iran is once again exploring those weapon designs. And then if you want to use a missile, obviously you have to marry up the warhead to the missile. But Iran has other delivery methods as well, through terrorist proxies. So I think that's one of the reasons why both President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu thought we- things that were coming to a head. A second reason is Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium range to target Israel, and short range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month. And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But why Thursday night?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, as President-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- There seems to be a difference in this--",
      "SEN. COTTON: --Well as President--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --idea of a sprint.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, as President Trump said on Friday morning that he had given Iran 60 days to make a deal. That was day 61--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And he scheduled talks on day 63 you know that. I mean, this was a, this wasn't really a hard deadline.",
      "SEN. COTTON: He gave them 60 days. On day 61 the strikes began.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Day 63, Steve Witkoff wanted to meet with him. But if this was a covert race to weaponize, though it- it raises questions here, because it appears President Trump's offer is to negotiate with the existing regime that is in place in Iran. Do you support a deal with the existing regime in Iran to stay in place? Do you support his push for diplomacy?",
      "SEN. COTTON: President Trump has always said his goal is to end Iran's nuclear weapons program, which means the surrender of its uranium enrichment capability--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. This would be offering them a lifeline, wouldn't it?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, it would be protecting our interests and securing Israel's interests as well on Iran not having a nuclear weapon. We've seen what happens when they don't have nuclear weapons. They're deliberately targeting civilian areas in Israel. We've seen their campaign of terror against Americans over the decades. That's why we can't allow them to have a nuclear weapon. And presidents have said for 20 years, presidents have said that. George Bush said it didn't act on it, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, frankly, aided and abetted Iran's nuclear program. Only Donald Trump has drawn that line and is willing to enforce that line.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's not enforcing that line. It is Israel that's bombing. As you just said, the United States is not involved in these offensive operations--",
      "SEN. COTTON: -- But in Israel, we are helping- we're--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Do you- but do you share the President's assessment that the way to finish this is through negotiating with the existing regime that the Israelis have called for the Iranian people to rise up against?",
      "SEN. COTTON: I think there's multiple ways to eliminate Iran's enrichment capability. They are today what they were Thursday morning, before these strikes started. As the President has said repeatedly, they can make a deal, or there's going to be bombing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move to some domestic issues, but very quickly, I know in the past, you have said that former officials who have a direct threat against them from Iran should continue to receive security. President Trump pulled it. Should they get it now?",
      "SEN. COTTON: We should probably revisit the threat that all persons face. Remember, President Trump faced assassination threats from Iran as well. In this moment of tension to ensure that no one who worked for President Trump in the first term or works for him now could be the target of Iranian agents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that security detail was pulled by the president himself. On immigration, the Trump administration has decided to pull back its policy a little bit. They are pausing raids on farms, hotels and restaurants. Arkansas has a lot of agricultural business in your state. Do you support this decision?",
      "SEN. COTTON: I think we need to have robust worksite enforcement. I don't think ICE is going to show up at one or two restaurants where they have an illegal migrant working. Usually, it's unscrupulous employers who have large numbers of illegal immigrants working in their work sites. And whatever work site it is, whatever industry it is, ICE has to be able to go and enforce our immigration laws and remove illegal immigrants.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President has pulled back from that. That was the change in policy last week when it came to farms, in particular.",
      "SEN. COTTON: I don't think we should pull back on any kind of enforcement at all. I think worksite enforcement in all industries needs to be able to move forward. And I think ICE agents on the front lines need the support of political leadership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "You would want more enforcement, including in manufacturing, including in construction, which could impact the economy?",
      "SEN. COTTON: We should not declare any industry or any work site that uses large numbers of illegal immigrants off-limits for enforcement of federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about the enforcement to date. As you know, there has been outcry. We've seen protests across the country because of the enforcement policies. You wrote an op-ed supporting President Trump's decision to send in federalized National Guard troops and active-duty Marines to California. You referred to it as the threat from the radical left , an overwhelming show of force to end the riots, and talked about communities being terrorized. Given the amount of tension in the country right now, is that really the language to use?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Yes, when you see left wing street militias who are throwing bricks and frozen water bottles at police officers and shooting them with fireworks, and unfortunately, you have mayors and governors in some places that won't allow police to maintain order, the next step is to call in the National Guard, and if the governor won't call on the National Guard, then the President has to federalize them. We always hope that the local police are allowed to do their job and have sufficient numbers to do their job to maintain order and protect innocent life and property. But if they can't, or they're not allowed to, the National Guard has to be on scene to restore civil order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: LAPD says they were handling when things turned violent, yesterday, they fired rubber bullets, but they said they had it under control.",
      "SEN. COTTON: The LA police chief said last weekend that his forces were overwhelmed, and they couldn't manage the situation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cotton, thank you very much for your time today. Face the Nation will be back in a minute, so stay with us.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Jun 2025 15:26:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California was briefly detained last week after being forcibly removed from a news conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California warned Sunday that if he, as a U.S. senator, could be forcibly removed from a Department of Homeland Security news conference, \"don't just imagine what they're capable of, but what they are doing when the cameras are not there\" to others.",
      "\"If that's how this administration responds to the senator with a question, don't just imagine what they're capable of, but what they are doing when the cameras are not there, to people without a title like United States senator, that cruel, disrespectful treatment of so many people who deserve much better,\" Padilla said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Padilla was removed on Thursday from a news conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles amid ongoing immigration raids and protests in the city. Last week, President Trump overrode California Gov. Gavin Newsom and sent in the National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to quell the protests.",
      "Noem was describing what she called the \"burdensome leadership\" of California's governor and the mayor of Los Angeles, when Padilla interrupted and attempted to ask a question before being pushed from the room. He could be heard yelling, \"I'm Sen. Alex Padilla and I have questions for the secretary,\" as he was forcefully escorted out of the room.",
      "Democrats on Capitol Hill and throughout the country expressed shock at the treatment of a U.S. senator, and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski called the incident \"horrible\" and \"not the America I know.\"",
      "Noem told reporters afterward that she \"wished that he would have reached out and identified himself and let us know who he was and that he wanted to talk.\"",
      "Los Angeles was among more than 2,000 cities nationwide that held protests Saturday against the Trump administration, which in L.A. resulted in police dispersing the crowd. Los Angeles Police Department officers said on a post to X that \"people in the crowd are throwing rocks, bricks, bottles and other objects\" when the march passed by the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building. Newsom on Saturday accused the Defense Department of using old images to promote the military presence.",
      "Padilla said Sunday that last week, he was supposed to have his own briefing with the same representatives of Northern Command in the same building as Noem's media event, but it was delayed due to the news conference. He said he asked if he could listen in because he does not feel Noem has provided \"substantive answers\" to questions to Congress, whether it be in formal requests via letters or in testimony before Congress.",
      "\"So to be able to ask a question of the secretary directly when they offered the meeting after the incident, I took it,\" Padilla said.",
      "Padilla said he wanted to ask about \"their justification for the federalization of the National Guard,\" which he considers \"not only not necessary, but counterproductive as we've seen this last week in Los Angeles.\"",
      "He also said he wanted to ask about the increasing number of stories of people who are \"undocumented, long-term residents of the United States who are otherwise law-abiding, working hard, paying taxes, raising families\" being targeted for deportation.",
      "Padilla said a \"key question\" he had for Noem was about how many criminals are being deported, which is who the Trump administration has claimed to be targeting.",
      "\"Of course, she had no data, had no answer,\" Padilla said. \"Promised to follow up. I hope, we'll see.\"",
      "Padilla added that it was the same reaction when he had the \"audacity to try to ask a question as a senator of a Cabinet secretary.\"",
      "\"The vast majority of people in that room knew who I was,\" Padilla said. \"I was escorted into that room by an FBI agent and a National Guard member. It's the Los Angeles press corps. It said United States Senate on the chest of my polo.\"",
      "Noem told reporters afterward that she and Padilla met after the incident and had a \"very productive\" conversation.",

      "Boelter is listed as the director of a private security company. Records show he served on a state board with Senator Hoffman. This image from the state senator's home security camera appears to show the suspect wearing a full face mask, what looks like a police uniform, and tactical vest. This happened at around 2:00 a.m.",
      "Around 2.5 hours later, during a precautionary safety check at Representative Hortman's home, officers spotted the suspect walking out the front door. He opened fire and then ran away. Police say he left behind a car equipped with flashing white and yellow lights and a police license plate.",
      "Inside were leaflets reading \"No Kings,\" a manifesto listing more than 50 possible targets, including abortion clinics, pro-abortion rights advocates, and other lawmakers from states beyond Minnesota.",
      "(End VT)",
      "LILIA LUCIANO: A man who shared a home with a suspect told reporters that he's a Christian, that he does not like abortion, but that he didn't seem really angry about politics, at least not lately.",

      "Israel was quick to retaliate, targeting an oil refinery and hitting buildings in Tehran. There have been casualties on both sides. At least 12 Israelis were killed this weekend, but that toll was dwarfed by the damage Israel inflicted on Iran, with almost 100 civilian deaths, nearly 30 of them children, and the assassination of top military commanders and scientists.",
      "The surprise Israeli strikes began on Thursday. Israel wants to cripple Iran's nuclear capability, already hitting four major facilities, Natanz, Tabriz, Isfahan, and Fordow, as well as key energy sites. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not done yet.",

Overnight, he vowed in a social media post that, if the U.S. was attacked in any way by Iran, that the \u2013 quote \u2013 \"full strength and might of U.S. armed forces would come down at levels never seen before,\" and then seemingly offered to negotiate a deal between Iran and Israel.",
      "We go now to Holly Williams, who is at Iran's border with Iraq.",
      "HOLLY WILLIAMS: Here in the Middle East, Iran has accused the U.S. of being complicit in Israel's attack and has threatened to target American military bases and ships if the U.S. blocks Iranian strikes on Israel.",
      "But the U.S. has already done that with air defense systems and a warship, according to a U.S. military official. There are around 40,000 American troops in the Middle East, a powerful presence that aims to protect U.S. interests, including trade routes.",
      "But if Iran did try to strike American forces, the roughly 2,500 U.S. troops here in Iraq could be the most obvious target, since they're right next door. Iran previously targeted U.S. forces in Iraq with ballistic missiles back in 2020 in retaliation for the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force.",
      "No U.S. service members were killed on that occasion. Since then, a series of shifts has reshaped the Middle East and weakened Iran and its proxies, the war in Gaza, Israel's decimation of the leadership of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the collapse of the Syrian regime, and now Israel's surprise attack.",
      "If Iran does target American forces this time, it would be extremely risky, because it will likely draw a sharp response from the U.S., when Iran is already under attack.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Holly Williams reporting from the Iraq-Iran border.",
      "And we're joined now in Washington by Senator Tom Cotton, who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.",

      "SENATOR TOM COTTON (R-Arkansas): Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know you are staying on top of all these events.",
      "When it comes to what President Trump has said publicly, he seems to be indicating not just that the U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, but he's saying this is not America's fight unless Iran hits the U.S.",
      "Should it be such a bright line?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, what the president said in his overnight post was a clear message to the ayatollahs, that, if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the U.S. military in a way no one's ever seen.",
      "That's a clear deterrent message, setting aside the threat that the nuclear program poses to Israel and to the United States, because, let's remember, the Iranian regime has been terrorizing Americans. It's killed thousands of Americans. It's taken them hostage. It still chants \"Death to America.\" And it's building missiles that can strike not just our troops or our friends in the region, but soon enough here in the United States as well.",
      "And that's why President Trump has been consistent for his 10 years in political life that we cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. We cannot allow them to have a path to a nuclear weapon with uranium enrichment. That's the deal that he was trying to negotiate for the last two months.",
      "But, as he said early last week, Iran was simply too stubborn. They weren't willing to come to the table and negotiate. And I have to disagree with the reporter who said that Israel strikes in Iran ended those negotiations. It was Iran's \u2013 Iran's stubbornness that ended them.",
      "President Trump was clear about that. And he is still clear that there is time, if they want to come back to negotiate an end to the uranium enrichment program, that he would accept that. But he's given them chance after chance, as he said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, in terms of the line he's drawing on military force, should the U.S. involvement be purely defensive and deterrent, or should the U.S. be willing to be engaged in these military operations?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I don't think he's drawn that line. He's been very clear that all options remain on the table to defend our own people, to support Israel\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He hasn't said that.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But he \u2013 well, he said that for 10 years, and he said it for months leading up to this moment.",
      "He said that Iran can make a deal and live happily without death, or there will be bombing. So, I think he's appropriately kept all options on the table. He made clear in the early days of this conflict, on Thursday night and Friday morning, that we back Israel to the hilt. There's almost 700,000 Americans in Israel at any time. So, of course, we're going to protect Israel, and that we have the best military technology in the world.",
      "And he said that he has proudly provided Israel with those weapons, both in his first term and in this term as well. So, we back Israel to the hilt all the way. But he's appropriately keeping all options on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's emphasizing again and again, this isn't us. This isn't America. This isn't an American operation.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: So, so far in this operation, we have not been involved in offensive strikes. We've been involved in other ways, through our provision of Israel with weapons over the years or our defense of Israel and its citizens and our citizens in Israel.",
      "Now, he has said his objective remains the same, which is Iran's nuclear disarmament. And he has said that that can happen still through a deal. I don't think\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He prefers diplomacy.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: And he would like Iran to come back to the table, I think, now that Iran sees that Israel and America mean business\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 and surrender its enrichment capabilities voluntarily. If that doesn't happen, though, I think these strikes are going to continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to the point, if it's really about destroying the nuclear program that Iran has, you know this very well, that there's this underground facility at Fordow, very deep, under a mountain.",
      "It's long been assessed that only the U.S. has the capability with a bunker-buster bomb to take it out. Should the United States offer that kind of massive ordnance penetrator to Israel to finish the job?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I'm not going to speculate about the methods that the United States or Israel might use\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But should they?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 to protect our own interests.",
      "I will simply say this. It is, as you say, widely known that Israel does not have heavy bombers. It doesn't have those 30,000-pound penetrating munitions. But, as we saw with Hezbollah last fall, as we saw in Iran on Thursday night, when the Mossad had infiltrated officers and agents and manufactured drones in Iran, Israel has more than a few tricks up their sleeve.",
      "And I wouldn't be surprised if Israel has other cards yet to play.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when it comes to differences in intelligence assessments, the U.S. intelligence that was made public in March said at the time the U.S. does not assess Iran's building a nuclear weapon and that the supreme leader has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended back in 2003.",
      "Was there more recent U.S. intel sharing or intel indicating that there was some kind of sprint for a bomb?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that seems a very different assessment from what Israel's claiming.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, unfortunately, Iran enriched a lot of the uranium to near weapons-grade over the four years of the Biden administration. And they\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not weaponization. You know that.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: They are \u2013 they are close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons.",
      "Now, that's not the only step to having a weapon. You also have to have the weapon design. We've seen indications that Iran is once again exploring those weapon designs. And then, if you want to use a missile, obviously, you have to marry up the warhead to the missile. But Iran has other delivery methods as well, through terrorist proxies.",
      "So I think that's one of the reasons why both President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu thought we \u2013 things that were coming to a head. A second reason is, Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium-range to target Israel and short-range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month.",
      "And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but why Thursday night?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, as President\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There seems to be a difference in this idea of a sprint.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, as President Trump \u2013 well, as President Trump said on Friday morning, that he had given Iran 60 days to make a deal.",
      "That was day 61.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And he scheduled talks on day 63. You know that.",
      "I mean, this was a \u2013 this wasn't really a hard deadline.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: He gave them 60 days. On day 61, the strikes began.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Day 63, Steve Witkoff wanted to meet with them.",
      "But if this was a covert race to weaponize, though, it \u2013 it raises questions here, because it appears President Trump's offer is to negotiate with the existing regime that is in place in Iran.",
      "Do you support a deal with the existing regime in Iran to stay in place? Do you support his push for diplomacy?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: President Trump has always said his goal is to end Iran's nuclear weapons program\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 which means the surrender of its uranium enrichment capability.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this would be offering them a lifeline, wouldn't it?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, it would be protecting our interests and securing Israel's interests as well in Iran not having a nuclear weapon.",
      "We've seen what happens when they don't have nuclear weapons. They're deliberately targeting civilian areas in Israel. We've seen their campaign of terror against Americans over the decades. That's why we can't allow them to have a nuclear weapon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: And presidents have said \u2013 for 20 years, presidents have said that. George Bush said it, didn't act on it. Barack Obama and Joe Biden, frankly, aided and abetted Iran's nuclear program. Only Donald Trump has drawn that line and is willing to enforce that line.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's not enforcing that line. It is Israel that's bombing. As you just said, the United States is not involved in these offensive operations.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But, in \u2013 in Israel, we are helping \u2013 we're help\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you \u2013 but do you share the president's assessment that the way to finish this is through negotiating with the existing regime that the Israelis have called for the Iranian people to rise up against?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think there's multiple ways to eliminate Iran's enrichment capability. They are today what they were Thursday morning, before these strikes started. As the president has said repeatedly, they can make a deal, or there's going to be bombing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move to some domestic issues, but, very quickly, I know in the past, you have said that former officials who have a direct threat against them from Iran should continue to receive security. President Trump pulled it.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think we should\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should they get it now?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We should probably revisit the threat that all persons face \u2013 remember, President Trump faced assassination threats from Iran as well \u2013 in this moment of tension, to ensure that no one who worked for President Trump in the first term or works for him now could be the target of Iranian agents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that security detail was pulled by the president himself.",
      "On immigration, the Trump administration has decided to pull back its policy a little bit. They are pausing raids on farms, hotels and restaurants. Arkansas has a lot of agricultural business in your state. Do you support this decision?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think we need to have robust worksite enforcement.",
      "I don't think ICE is going to show up at one or two restaurants where they have an illegal migrant working. Usually, it's unscrupulous employers who have large numbers of illegal immigrants working in their worksites. And whatever worksite it is, whatever industry it is, ICE has to be able to go and enforce our immigration laws and remove illegal immigrants.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president has pulled back from that. That was the change in policy last week when it came to farms, in particular.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I don't \u2013 I don't think we should \u2013 I don't think we should pull back to any \u2013 on any kind of enforcement at all.",
      "I think worksite enforcement in all industries needs to be able to move forward. And I think ICE agents on the front lines need the support of political leadership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You would want more enforcement, including in manufacturing, including in construction, where it could impact the economy?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We \u2013 we \u2013 we should \u2013 we should not \u2013 we should not declare any industry or any worksite that uses large numbers of illegal immigrants off-limits for enforcement of federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about the enforcement to date.",
      "As you know, there has been outcry. We've seen protests across the country because of the enforcement policies. You wrote an op-ed supporting President Trump's decision to send in federalized National Guard troops and active-duty Marines to California.",
      "You referred to it as \"the threat from the radical left, an overwhelming show of force to end the riots,\" and talked about communities being terrorized.",
      "Given the amount of tension in the country right now, is that really the language to use?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes, when you see left-wing street militias who are throwing bricks and frozen water bottles at police officers and shooting them with fireworks.",
      "And, unfortunately, you have mayors and governors in some places that won't allow police to maintain order. The next step is to call in the National Guard. And if the governor won't call on the National Guard, then the president has to federalize them.",
      "We always hope that the local police are allowed to do their job and have sufficient numbers to do their job to maintain order and protect innocent life and property. But, if they can't, or they're not allowed to, the National Guard has to be on scene to restore civil order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: LAPD says they were handling when things turned violent yesterday. They fired rubber bullets, but they said they had it under control.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: The L.A. police chief said last weekend that his forces were overwhelmed, and they couldn't manage the situation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cotton, thank you very much for your time today.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute, so stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by two senators in a rare bipartisan interview, Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal. They're co-sponsors on legislation to put secondary sanctions on Russia.",
      "Good morning to you both.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina): Good morning.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-Connecticut): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to that conflict in a moment, but starting here on the Middle East, Senator Graham, you said you believe it's in America's interest to go all in to help Israel finish the job.",
      "It sounds like you mean offensive support.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So, the worst possible outcome for the world is for the Iranian nuclear program to survive after all this. How do you destroy their program? Through diplomacy \u2013 I prefer that \u2013 or through military action.",
      "If diplomacy is not successful, and we are left with the option of force, I would urge President Trump to go all in to make sure that, when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program. If that means providing bombs, provide bombs. If that means flying\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bunker-busting bombs?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Whatever bombs.",
      "If it means flying with Israel, fly with Israel. The worst possible outcome for the world is to take the Iranian nuclear program on and leave it standing. That will be a disaster.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, what's your view? How involved should the U.S. get?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Let's begin with the basic proposition that ought to motivate American policy, as well as the world.",
      "A nuclear-armed Iran is a unacceptable threat to the world, not just to Israel, but to the United States as well. And I support Israel's right to defend itself against this existential menace.",
      "I'm very concerned right now about United States personnel in the region, our service men and women, but also the civilians that are there. I'm getting phone calls from families in Connecticut who are deeply worried about their children who are there, about the hostage families.",
      "I support the president's effort to prioritize diplomacy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk more about this after the commercial break, so please stay here with us.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you're looking for more Face the Nation, including extended interviews and special content, you can subscribe to our podcast. It's available on all platforms, including Apple Podcast, Spotify and Amazon.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return now to our conversation with Senators Graham and Blumenthal.",
      "Senator Blumenthal, before we get to Ukraine, I just want to tie up the Middle East here.",
      "You know, the defense secretary was testifying to Congress this week, and he said he's moved equipment meant to counter drones in Ukraine over to the Middle East now because of this escalation.",
      "What more is needed to protect U.S. personnel?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We need to move assets. And we've done so. Not only to protect U.S. personnel, but also to enable Israel to defend itself against Iran's retaliation.",
      "But I think that the president is right to try to bring the two sides together. There is a deal that's possible here if Iran were to abandon its effort to build nuclear bombs that endanger not only Israel but the entire regional stability, because all the other Arab nations are going to have nuclear weapons if Iran does as well. But Americans have no interest in a forever war. And so I think we need to be mindful about the priority of diplomacy here and bring the two sides together, as well as protecting U.S. personnel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Senator Graham, the \u2013 the thing with diplomacy is that the Israeli prime minister is calling for the Iranian people to rise up against the regime.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A regime he says is calling for the destruction of his state.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It doesn't really seem like there's a compromise there if it's truly this existential. Is this just leading us towards the outcome you say, which is the United States getting involved in military conflict?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, this \u2013 I would love for the regime to fall. If you don't, if you want this regime to stay in power, you're wanting people to oppress the Iranian people. You want people to threaten their neighbors, to \u2013 to be the largest state \u2013 who wants the largest state sponsor of terrorism to stay in place? But regime change is not the policy of the United States. It is not the purpose of this attack yet. But if there is one attack on an American anywhere in the Mideast by Iran, then you'll get regime change.",
      "So, what are we dealing with? We're dealing with a non-negotiable part of the deal. They can't have a nuclear program that can make a bomb. Diplomacy is preferred, as Dick says, but force may be the only option. And I said as clearly as I can say, if diplomacy fails, Mr. President, President Trump, you've been great, help Israel finish the job. Give them bombs. Fly with them if necessary.",
      "I cannot stress to you how \u2013 if you want to get Russia right, you want to make China be better, you want to convince international terrorism we mean business, you've got to finish the job with Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see if there's any willingness to negotiate. So far, we haven't seen much.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, that's a big mistake on Iran's part. It's not on President Trump's. If we don't have notions, it's not because of Trump, it's because of the ayatollah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or \u2013 you can't necessarily bomb someone into concessions that they were not willing to make, right? I mean here \u2013 is there \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I don't think they have any desire to make concessions.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: If \u2013 if Iran miscalculates now \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: It will face the consequences. But there is a road to a deal. President Obama reached a deal. Far from perfect. President Trump ripped it up. If it were in effect, maybe we could have stopped the Iran nuclear buildup, which has occurred. They're close to ten bombs now. But there is the possibility of diplomacy. In the meantime, the United States ought to provide the means for Israel to defend against this Iranian retaliation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to clarify, when you say close to ten bombs, you mean they would have enough nuclear fuel? But as far as we know, from the U.S. assessment, they hadn't made the political decision to turn that into a weapon. We didn't hear that from the Senate Intel chair when I asked that.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: What purpose do you need \u2013 if I may, what purpose is there for enriched uranium at 60 percent other than making a weapon?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Leverage (ph).",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Why do you have 900 pounds of this stuff if you don't want to make a weapon?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, the \u2013 the assessment was they wanted the leverage, right? So \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, right, whatever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the bipartisan work you are both doing, if I can.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yay.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: By the way \u2013",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Finally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran and \u2013 Iran and Russia \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. And we're bipartisan on this. We say the same, actually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And \u2013 you are. Iran and Russia work together.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: And, you know, if I can just add one more point about Iran \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Because we're going to talk about Russian sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think we ought to strengthen sanctions against Iran, which is a non-kinetic, a peaceful means of exerting pressure. I'm hoping that perhaps Senator Graham and I \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I will be your wingman. We'll write the bill right here on television. China, if you're listening, stop buying Russian oil and stop helping the Iranians. You would make the world a safer place if you would stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They buy it because it's cheap, though. And they \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, they \u2013 well, you know \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that \u2013 but right now \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well then, they should play a price for propping up Putin's war machine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sure.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We should crush their economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So, tell me about that. So, with the \u2013 the sanctions bill that you all are working on, you have a veto-proof majority.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just need the Senate leader to put it to a floor and you need the president to tell him go. What are you waiting for?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think the president should call on the Senate to vote approval of the Russian sanction bill literally tomorrow. He's on his way tonight to the G-7 meeting. He will be sitting across from world leaders. Right now, very bluntly, the perception may be one of weakness in terms of America's position on Ukraine. He can be there in a position of strength. This bill will pass overwhelmingly. It has 84 evenly divided co- sponsored. It will get 90 votes on the floor of the Senate.",
      "This moment cries out for presidential leadership. There is an urgency here. We've seen the neighborhoods decimated, people killed in their sleep, women and children shot in the back of their heads and buried in mass graves in Bukha. Children who are kidnapped and re-educated, 20,000 of them, behind Russian lines. These atrocities are ongoing. And the people of Ukraine are bleeding and dying.",
      "So, I am hoping that the president will affirmatively show leadership here and call on the Senate to vote. The majority leader could do it tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We have some technical issues to work out. But I really think the moment has come for President Trump to call on the Senate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, President Trump tweeted yesterday that he did speak to Vladimir Putin, who called very nicely to wish me a happy birthday and talk about Iran.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said they're going to speak again this week.",
      "President Trump has put sanctions on Iran while talking to Iran. Why won't he put sanctions on Russia while talking to Russia?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We have sanctions on Russia. He \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not new Trump sanctions. You know that.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Just \u2013 so, I find it odd. So, my Democratic friends are holding him back when it comes to Iran. We appreciate you trying to do diplomacy. What am I saying? Do diplomacy with Iran until it doesn't work. What am I saying with Russia? I don't mind you \u2013 I don't care if you go on vacation with Putin. I don't care how it ends. I want the war to end so we don't start new wars. I want our \u2013 Ukraine surviving when the war ends. I want Putin not to be overly rewarded for the invasion.",
      "To China, if you stop buying Russian oil, cheap, and India, the war machine would grind to a halt. President Trump has tried diplomacy. And I will say this, I talked to him last night, you've made very sincere efforts to get Putin to the table. I think he's playing a game with you and the entire world. It is now time to change the game with Putin.",
      "I talked to President Trump last night. Stay tuned. If we do not have a breakthrough soon, I would expect that these sanctions will move through the Senate and the House. And to China, if you want your economy ruined, keep buying Russian cheap oil. If you want to be a new nation in the eyes of the civilized world, change your behavior regarding Putin and the ayatollah. And until you change your behavior \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You're going to be seen as a problem, not a solution.",
      "So, these sanctions are coming if Putin doesn't change. And to my good friend Dick, you've been a great ally. If we can't get the ayatollah back to the table, it is now time to end his nuclear program using military force, jointly with Israel if we have to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: If we get Iran wrong, good luck with Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, the bill that you put forward will put a 500 percent tariff, as I understand it, on imported goods from countries that buy Russia's oil, their uranium, their gas, other products. It would hit China. It would hit India. The U.S. is also trying to negotiate trade deals with them. Is that getting in the way?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think there is really no obstacle to our moving ahead with these bone-crushing sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if oil prices spike because of what's happening in the Middle East?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: You know, we are now energy independent when it comes to oil, the United States. Europe has weaned itself off Russian oil. We visited with President Macron, we've talked to Chancellor Merz. Europe is solidly behind these sanctions. And we've incorporated flexibility in this bill based on our national security for a potential waiver where our interests are concerned, unforeseeable or unknowably right now. We've incorporated exceptions for our European allies who are aiding Ukraine in the billions of dollars, giving them a little bit more time to adjust.",
      "This is a carefully constructed bill.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They get 20 percent of their gas from Russia, right?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Can \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: What he says, that there's three categories. If you're not doing business with Russia, you don't have anything to worry about. If you're doing business with Russia but you're helping Ukraine, you have a carveout for 270 days. If you're doing business with Russia and not helping Ukraine, you're screwed. The president can waive part or all of this based on our national interest. But to the people who wonder, should we pay a price for our freedom? We have in the past.",
      "Go to Arlington. Oil prices will go up if we confront Russia through our bill. Oil prices will go up if we try to confront Iran for their nuclear ambitions. But you pay now or you pay later.",
      "If we get Iran right and we get peace with Russia/Ukraine, not only do oil prices come down, the world will be better off. So, this idea of having freedom and not sacrificing never existed, nor does it exist now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I want to ask you as well about what's happening here at home with the protests we have seen around the country and some of them at times turning violent. There has been criticism of Democrats' policies on immigration. Do you think that this confrontation that we are seeing now, between military forces, federalized, and protesters is partly because of what Democrats have done to date?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: The use of military, whether it's the National Guard or the Marines, can be inflammatory and provocative. We had protests across the country yesterday that were entirely peaceful. I was at a number of them in Connecticut, in Hartford and Farmington and elsewhere, all around the country. I think this country knows how to do peaceful protest. And the exceptions ought to be handled by the local police and prosecutors locally.",
      "I spent most of my life in law enforcement before I had this job. I was the chief federal prosecutor in Connecticut. Then I was attorney general for 20 years. And the reliance on state and local police I think is well-founded. And I've supported \u2013 in fact, I've introduced a bill that would limit use of the Insurrection Act, would define better what is a rebellion, and compel the president to come back to Congress for approval if he uses this kind of federal force.",
      "So, I think that there are criticisms to be made of immigration policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: In fact, I favor comprehensive immigration reform. We need it. But that is separate \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would call on local law enforcement to perhaps stand up more and deal with it at the local level?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: It's the local level where law enforcement happens in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We rely on state and local police. And that ought to be the way we enforce our laws in this country. And emphasize the importance of peaceful protests, such as we saw yesterday around the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "All right, Senators, thank you for joining us for a bipartisan interview. Rare, as we said.",
      "We'll be back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Saturday, demonstrators participating in the \"no kings\" movement marched in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., as part of an organized effort to protest President Trump's policies, including recent deportation sweeps. Organizers of the \"no kings\" rally said that over 5 million people participated coast to coast.",
      "Most were peaceful. But in Salt Lake City, at least one person was injured in a shooting during a demonstration. And in Portland, Oregon, local police declared a riot outside an I.C.E. facility for a few hours before that crowd dispersed.",
      "And we're joined now by California Senator Alex Padilla.",
      "Good morning and Happy Father's Day to you.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA (D-California): Thank you. Thank you. Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there and including those who are living a little bit fearful right now because of what we're seeing, these increasingly cruel and extreme immigration enforcement raids. But, nonetheless, they're going to work, trying to provide for their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about your personal experience with some of this. As many of our viewers saw that video of you being briefly detained when you were trying to get a question to the Homeland Security secretary. Their office \u2013 her office later said you spoke for nearly 15 minutes afterwards. Did you get the answer to the question you were trying to ask? And \u2013 and what was it?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, sadly, no. And to a little bit of context here. The reason I tried to \u2013 the reason I was at the press conference, I was \u2013 I was at a scheduled briefing with representatives at Northern Command, just a couple doors down the hall, in the same federal building, when I learned of the press conference. My briefing delayed because the folks I was supposed to meet with were at that press conference.",
      "So, I asked if we could listen in. I was escorted over. And that's what I was doing.",
      "Why? Because for months and months, whether it's in committee, the secretary herself testifying and not providing substantive answers to questions, other representatives of the department, formal letters and inquiries that we've submitted, doing my job as a senator, to get information as part of our oversight and accountability responsibility.",
      "So, to be able to ask a question of the secretary directly, when they offered the meeting after the incident, I took it but, sadly, no, nothing substantive, nothing informative.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She couldn't answer the question or \u2013",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Either couldn't or wouldn't. And \u2013 and, frankly, that says a lot, right, in terms of the type of \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What was the question?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well, among other things, their justification for the \u2013 the federalization of the National Guard, not only not necessary but counterproductive as we've seen this last week in Los Angeles. And also just truth. You know, for all the talk about the focus and targeting of violent criminals, if that's all the Trump administration was doing, there would be no debate. There's no disagreement on that.",
      "But as you're hearing more and more stories of undocumented, long-term residents of the United States who are otherwise law-abiding, working hard, paying taxes, raising families. And, frankly, working in jobs that under the first Trump administration, when the Covid pandemic hit, were deemed essential, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Workers in restaurants, in agricultural fields, in health care, construction, et cetera, that's who's being targeted now, and that's why there's so much fear and \u2013 and terror in communities, not just in Los Angeles but throughout the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the vast majority of immigrants in California, we went and we looked at the stats. They are in this country legally. But Pew Research says your state has nearly two million undocumented and they make up about 7 percent of the entire labor force in some of those farming and service jobs that you \u2013 you talked about.",
      "Since the Trump administration this week told I.C.E. to pull back a bit when it comes to enforcement, do you see that as a step in the right direction, and do you know what triggered that decision?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, so I don't know exactly what triggered that decision. I'll take it. Is it a step in the right direction? It's at least a baby step. And let's hope there's more to follow because they're responding to what I and others have been saying for months and what's frankly years, going back to the first Trump administration. You know, you \u2013 you \u2013 you want stats? Let's talk about stats. The \u2013 the state of California, the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation, mostly documented, some undocumented. This is the same California that is the largest economy of any state in the nation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Fourth-largest economy in the world. Not despite the immigrant population, but thanks to the contributions of so many immigrants as a workforce, as consumers and as \u2013 as entrepreneurs. So, again, focus on the dangerous, violent criminals. No disagreement there. But the \u2013 the folks who are otherwise law-abiding, tax-paying and \u2013 and enriching communities, there's got to be a better way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: A pathway towards legalization. A pathway to citizenship for dreamers, farm workers and others.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 that's \u2013 that is hoping for \u2013 for movement in Congress that would take some time.",
      "I did note it was interesting to see the \u2013 in the House, the Republican Hispanic conference put forth a letter asking for a breakdown of how many criminals were among those actually deported.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: And that was \u2013 yes, that was \u2013 and that was one of the key questions I had for the secretary. Of course, she had no data, had no answer, promised to follow up, I hope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: We'll see. And \u2013 and I also want to be clear about this, because when I had the audacity to try to ask a question, as a Senator of a cabinet secretary, that's what happened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: And you saw the response. Everybody's seen the video. You know, it wasn't about me. But if that's how this administration responds to a senator with a question, don't just imagine what they're capable of but what they are doing when the cameras are not there to people without a title like United States senator. That cruel, disrespectful treatment of so many people who deserve much better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see in our polling \u2013 on the policy front, we see in our polling that there still is broad support for President Trump's mass deportation policy. Our last CBS poll, as of last Sunday, showed 54 percent approval. There was an interesting \"Washington Post\" piece written by David Ignatius that was pretty sharp about Democrats, saying that, \"they've gotten the border issue so wrong for so long, it's political malpractice.\" And that he was basically arguing, Democrats are handing to Trump the confrontation he wanted with the military, citing actions during the first administration.",
      "Do you think that he has a point there?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: No, I think, you know, \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the public approval is so high of deportation.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well \u2013 but details matter. It depends. You know, it depends on how you ask the question. If you ask the same people, you know, do they think we should maintain due process in the United States of America, the answer is overwhelming, yes. Do dreamers deserve better than the limbo that they find themselves in? Overwhelmingly, on a bipartisan basis, yes.",
      "And so, I think it's important to break down three things. Number one, do we need a safe and secure, ordinarily, humane border? Absolutely. No disagreement there. People seeking to come to the United States, whether it's to seek asylum, on work visas, et cetera, we definitely have to modernize that system and be more strategic in those capacities. But we can't forget the millions of long-term residents, people who have been here working, paying taxes, raising families, buying homes, contributing to the strength of our economy, they deserve better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are the ranking member on the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees the Capitol Police. What, if anything, can you tell us about the state of security for lawmakers given what's happening in Minnesota?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, look, a lot of questions, a lot of concerns. I work directly with both the U.S. Capitol Police and the Senate Sergeant at Arms. And they're doing what they need to do to ensure the \u2013 the safety of members of \u2013 of Congress. But I also think it's more than appropriate to step back and say, why are tensions so high, not just in Los Angeles, but throughout the country? And I can't help but point to the beginning of, not just the first Trump term, but the \u2013 the beginning of the campaign. The tone with which the president launched his first campaign for president, served throughout his first term and continues in this term. For a cabinet secretary, during a press conference, to not be able or be willing to deescalate a situation when I was trying to ask a question, that's just indicative of the tone of the administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You wanted her to say, wait a second, I \u2013 I know who he is, calm down, let him go? Is that what you're saying?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: The \u2013 the vast majority of people in that room knew who I was. I was escorted into that room by an FBI agent and a National Guard's member. It's the Los Angeles Press Corp. It said, United States Senate on the chest of my polo.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Padilla, thank you for joining us today.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sens. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 15, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by two senators in a rare, bipartisan interview: Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal. They're co-sponsors on legislation to put secondary sanctions on Russia. Good morning to you both.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good morning.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to that conflict in a moment, but starting here on the Middle East, Senator Graham, you said you believe it's \"in America's interest to go all in to help Israel finish the job.\" It sounds like you mean offensive support.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: So, the worst possible outcome for the world is for the Iranian nuclear program to survive after all this. How do you destroy their program? Through diplomacy, I prefer that, or through military action. If diplomacy is not successful, and we left with the option of force, I would urge President Trump to go all in to make sure that when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program. If that means providing bombs, provide bombs. If that means flying --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bunker-busting bombs?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Whatever bombs. If it means flying with Israel, fly with Israel. The worst possible outcome for the world is to take the Iranian nuclear program on and leave it standing. That will be a disaster.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, what's your view? How involved should the US get?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: Let's begin with the basic proposition that ought to motivate American policy as well as the world. A nuclear-armed Iran is a unacceptable threat to the world, not just to Israel, but to the United States as well. And I support Israel's right to defend itself against this existential menace. I'm very concerned right now about United States personnel in the region, our servicemen and women, but also the civilians that are there. I'm getting phone calls from families in Connecticut who are deeply worried about their children who were there, about the hostage families. I support the President's effort to prioritize diplomacy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk more about this after the commercial break. So please stay here with us, and we'll be right back.",
      "((COMMERCIAL BREAK))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And welcome back to Face the Nation. We return now to our conversation with Senators Graham and Blumenthal. Senator Blumenthal, before we get to Ukraine, I just want to tie up the Middle East here. You know, the defense secretary was testifying to Congress this week, and he said he's moved equipment meant to counter drones in Ukraine over to the Middle East now, because of this escalation. What more is needed to protect U.S. personnel?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: We need to move assets, and we've done so. Not only to protect U.S. personnel, but also to enable Israel to defend itself against Iran's retaliation. But I think that the President is right to try to bring the two sides together. There is a deal that's possible here, if Iran were to abandon its effort to build nuclear bombs that endanger not only Israel, but the entire regional stability, because all the other Arab nations are going to have nuclear weapons if Iran does as well. But Americans have no interest in a Forever War. And so, I think we need to be mindful about the priority of diplomacy here and bring the two sides together as well as protecting U.S. personnel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, the thing with diplomacy is that the Israeli Prime Minister is calling for the Iranian people to rise up against the regime, a regime he says is calling for the destruction of his state. It doesn't really seem like there's a compromise there if it's truly this existential. Is this just leading us towards the outcome, you say, which is the United States getting involved in military conflict?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well, I would love for the regime to fall. If you don't- if you want this regime to stay in power, you're wanting people to oppress the Iranian people. You want people to threaten their neighbors, to- to be the largest states- who wants the largest state sponsor of terrorism to stay in place? But, regime change is not the policy of the United States. It is not the purpose of this attack, yet. But if there is one attack on an American anywhere in the Mideast by Iran, then you'll get regime change. So, what are we dealing with? We're dealing with a non-negotiable part of the deal. They can't have a nuclear program that can make a bomb. Diplomacy is preferred, as Dick says, but force may be the only option. And I've said as clearly as I can say, if diplomacy fails, Mr. President- President Trump, you've been great, help Israel finish the job. Give them bombs, fly with them if necessary. I cannot stress to you how, if you want to get Russia right, you want to make China be better. You want to convince international terrorism we mean business, you've got to finish the job with Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see if there's any willingness to negotiate. So far, we haven't seen much.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: That's a big mistake on Iran's part. It's not on President Trump's- if we don't have negotiations, it's not because of Trump. It's because of the Ayatollah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or- I mean, you can't necessarily bomb someone into concessions that they were not willing to make, right?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I don't think they had any desire to make concessions.",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: If Iran miscalculates now, it will face the consequences. But there is a road to a deal. President Obama reached a deal. Far from perfect. President Trump ripped it up. If it were in effect, maybe, we could have stopped the Iran nuclear buildup, which has occurred. They're close to 10 bombs now. But, there is the possibility of diplomacy. In the meantime, the United States ought to provide the means for Israel to defend against this Iranian retaliation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to clarify, when you say close to 10 bombs, you mean they would have enough nuclear fuel. But, as far as we know, from the US assessment, they hadn't made the political decision to turn that into a weapon. We didn't hear that from the Senate Intel chair when I asked that.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: What purpose is there for enriched uranium at 60% other than making a weapon? Why do you have 900 pounds of this stuff if you don't want to make a weapon?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, the- the assessment was, they wanted the leverage, right?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, right. Whatever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you about the bipartisan work you are both doing, if I can. By the way \u2013",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: Finally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Iran and Russia --",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: --We're bipartisan on this.",
      "((CROSSTALK))",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: And, you know, if I could just add one more point about Iran?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: Because we're going to talk about Russian sanctions, I think we ought to strengthen sanctions against Iran. Which is a non-kinetic, a peaceful means of exerting pressure. I'm hoping that perhaps Senator Graham will --",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: I'll be your wingman. We'll write the bill right here on television. China, if you're listening, stop buying Russian oil, and stop helping the Iranians. You make the world a safer place if you would stop",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They buy it because it's cheap, though. Yeah, they --",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: They should pay a price for propping up Putin's war machine. We should crush their economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so tell me about that. So, with the sanctions bill that you all are working on, you have a veto-proof majority. You just need the Senate leader to put it to a floor vote, and you need the President to tell him \"go\". What are you waiting for?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: I think the president should call on the Senate to vote approval of the Russian sanctions bill literally tomorrow. He's on his way tonight to the G7 meeting. He will be sitting across from world leaders. Right now, very bluntly, the perception may be one of weakness in terms of America's position on Ukraine. He can be there in a position of strength. This bill will pass overwhelmingly. Has 84 evenly divided co-sponsors. It will get 90 votes on the floor of the Senate. This moment cries out for presidential leadership. There is an urgency here. We've seen the neighborhoods decimated, people killed in their sleep, women and children shot in the back of their heads and buried in mass graves in Bucha, children who are kidnapped and re-educated, 20,000 of them, behind Russian lines. These atrocities are ongoing, and the people of Ukraine are bleeding and dying. So I am hoping that the President will affirmatively show leadership here and call on the Senate to vote. The majority leader could do it tomorrow--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah.",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: We have some technical issues to work out, but I really think the moment has come for President Trump to call on the Senate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, President Trump tweeted yesterday that he did speak to Vladimir Putin who called very nicely to wish me a happy birthday and talk about Iran. He said they're going to speak again this week. President Trump has put sanctions on Iran while talking to Iran. Why won't he put sanctions on Russia while talking to Russia?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: We have sanctions on Russia. He provided--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Not new Trump sanctions. You know that.--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: --Just. So I find it odd. So my Democratic friends are holding him back when it comes to Iran. We really appreciate you trying to do diplomacy. What am I saying? Do diplomacy with Iran until it doesn't work. What am I saying with Russia? I don't mind you, I don't care if you go on vacation with Putin. I don't care how it ends, I want the war to end so we don't start new wars. I want Ukraine surviving when the war ends. I want Putin not to be overly rewarded for the invasion. To China, if you stop buying Russian oil cheap and India, the war machine would grind to a halt. President Trump has tried diplomacy. And I will say this, I talked to him last night, you've made very sincere efforts to get Putin to the table. I think he's playing a game with you and the entire world. It is now time to change the game with Putin. I talked to President Trump last night. Stay tuned. If we do not have a breakthrough soon, I would expect that these sanctions will move through the Senate and the House. And to China, if you want your economy ruined, keep buying Russian cheap oil. If you want to be a new nation in the eyes of the civilized world, change your behavior regarding Putin and the Ayatollah. Until you change your behavior, you're going to be seen as a problem, not a solution. So these sanctions are coming if Putin doesn't change. And to my good friend, Dick, you've been a great ally. If we can't get the Ayatollah back to the table, it is now time to end his nuclear program using military force jointly with Israel if we have to. If we get Iran wrong, good luck with Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, the bill that you put forward will put a 500% tariff, as I understand it, on imported goods from countries that buy Russia's oil, their uranium, their gas, other products. It'd hit China, it'd hit India. U.S. is also trying to negotiate trade deals with them. Is that getting in the way?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: I think there is really no obstacle to our moving ahead with these bone crushing sanctions--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Even if oil prices spike because of what's happening in the Middle East?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: You know we are now energy independent when it comes to oil, the United States. Europe has weaned itself off Russian oil. We visited with President Macron. We've talked to Chancellor Mertz. Europe is solidly behind these sanctions, and we've incorporated flexibility in this bill, based on our national security, for a potential waiver where our interests are concerned unforeseeably or unknowably right now. We've incorporated exemptions for our European allies who are aiding Ukraine in the billions of dollars, giving them a little bit more time to adjust. This is a carefully constructed bill--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --They get 20% of their gas from Russia.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: What he says, there's three categories. If you're not doing business with Russia, you don't have anything to worry about. If you're doing business with Russia, but you're helping Ukraine you have a carve out for 270 days. If you're doing business with Russia and not helping Ukraine, you're screwed. The president can waive part of all of this based on our national interest, but to the people who wonder should we pay a price for our freedom? We have in the past. Go to Arlington. Oil prices will go up if we confront Russia through our bill. Oil prices will go up if we try to confront Iran for their nuclear ambitions. But you pay now or you pay later. If we get Iran right and we get peace with Russia, Ukraine, not only do oil prices come down, the world will be better off. So this idea of having freedom and not sacrificing never existed nor does it exist now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I want to ask you as well about what's happening here at home, with the protests we have seen around the country, and some of them, at times, turning violent. There has been criticism of Democrats policies on immigration. Do you think that this confrontation that we are seeing now between military forces, federalized, and protesters is partly because of what Democrats have done to date?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: The use of military, whether it's the National Guard or the Marines, can be inflammatory and provocative. We had protests across the country yesterday that were entirely peaceful. I was at a number of them in Connecticut, in Hartford and Farmington and elsewhere, all around the country. I think this country knows how to do peaceful protest, and the exceptions ought to be handled by the local police and prosecutors locally. I spent most of my life in law enforcement before I had this job. I was the chief federal prosecutor in Connecticut, then I was attorney general for 20 years, and the reliance on state and local police, I think, is well founded. And I've supported, in fact, I've introduced a bill that would limit use of the Insurrection Act, would define better what is a rebellion and compel the president to come back to Congress for approval if he uses this kind of federal force. So I think that there are criticisms to be made of immigration policies. In fact, I favor comprehensive immigration reform. We need it, but that is separate--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But you would call local law enforcement to perhaps stand up more and deal with it at the local level?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: It's the local level where law enforcement happens in this country. We rely on state and local police, and that ought to be the way we enforce our laws in this country and emphasize the importance of peaceful protests, such as we saw yesterday around the country.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Alex Padilla, Democrat of California, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 15, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by California Senator Alex Padilla. Good morning and Happy Father's Day to you.",
      "SEN. ALEX PADILLA: Thank you. Thank you. Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there, and including those who are probably living a little bit fearful right now because of what we're seeing these increasingly cruel and extreme immigration enforcement raids, but nonetheless, they're going to work trying to provide for their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about your personal experience with some of this, as many of our viewers saw that video of you being briefly detained when you were trying to get a question in to the Homeland Security Secretary. There- her office later said you spoke for nearly 15 minutes afterwards. Did you get the answer to the question you were trying to ask? And what was it?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Yes- sadly, no. And so a little bit of context here, the reason I tried to- the reason I was at the press conference, it was at a scheduled briefing with representatives of Northern Command just a couple doors down the hall in the same federal building when I learned of the press conference. My briefing delayed because the folks I was supposed to meet with were at that press conference. So I asked if we could listen in I was escorted over, and that's what I was doing. Why? Because for months and months, whether it's in committee, the Secretary herself testifying and not providing substantive answers to questions, other representatives of the department, formal letters and inquiries that we've submitted, doing my job as a senator to get information as part of our oversight and accountability responsibility. So to be able to ask a question of the Secretary directly when they offered the meeting after the incident, I took it. But sadly, no, nothing substantive, nothing informative--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She couldn't answer the question, or--",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Either couldn't or wouldn't. And frankly, that says a lot, right? In terms of they type--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What was the question?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Well, among other things, their justification for the federalization of the National Guard, not only not necessary, but counterproductive as we've seen this last week in Los Angeles, and also just truth. You know, for all the talk about the focus and targeting of violent criminals, if that's all the Trump administration was doing, there would be no debate. There is no disagreement on that. But as you're hearing more and more stories of undocumented, long term residents of the United States who are otherwise law abiding, working hard, paying taxes, raising families and, frankly, working in jobs that under the first Trump administration, when the COVID pandemic hit, were deemed essential.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Right? Workers in restaurants, in agricultural fields, in health care, construction, etc. That's who's being targeted now, and that's why there's so much fear and terror in communities, not just in Los Angeles, but throughout the country,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the vast majority of immigrants in California, we went and we looked at the stats. They are in this country legally, but Pew Research says your state has nearly 2 million undocumented and they make up about 7% of the entire labor force in some of those farming and service jobs that you you talked about. Since the Trump administration this week told ICE to pull back a bit when it comes to enforcement. Do you see that as a step in the right direction, and do you know what triggered that decision?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Yeah, so I don't know exactly what triggered that decision. I'll take it. Is it a step in the right direction? It's at least a baby step. Let's hope there's more to follow, because they're responding to what I and others have been saying for months and months and, frankly, years, going back to the first Trump administration. You want stats. Let's talk about stats. The state of California, the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation, mostly documented, some undocumented. This is the same California that is the largest economy of any state in the nation, fourth largest economy in the world, not despite the immigrant population, but thanks to the contributions of so many immigrants as workforce, as consumers and as entrepreneurs. So again, focus on the dangerous, violent criminals. No disagreement there, but the folks are otherwise law abiding, tax paying and enriching communities, there's got to be a better way, a pathway towards legalization, a pathway to citizenship for 'Dreamers', farm workers and others.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that's- that is hoping for movement in Congress that would take some time. I did note it was interesting to see the- in the House, the Republican Hispanic Conference, put forth a letter asking for a breakdown of how many criminals were among those actually reported.",
      "SEN. PADILLA: And that was one of the key questions they had for the Secretary. Of course, she had no data, had no answer. Promised to follow up. I hope, we'll see. And I also want to be clear about this, because when I had the audacity to try to ask a question as a Senator of a Cabinet Secretary, that's what happened. And you saw the response, everybody's seen the video, it wasn't about me, right? If that's how this administration responds to the Senator with a question, don't just imagine what they're capable of, but what they are doing when the cameras are not there, to people without a title like United States Senator, that cruel, disrespectful treatment of so many people who deserve much better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see in our polling on the policy front, we see in our polling that there still is broad support for President Trump's mass deportation policy. Our last CBS poll, as of last Sunday, showed 54% approval. There was an interesting Washington Post piece written by David Ignatius that was pretty sharp about Democrats saying that \"They've gotten the border issue so wrong for so long. It's political malpractice,\" and that he was basically arguing Democrats are handing Trump the confrontation he wanted with the military, citing actions during the first administration. Do you think that he has a point there?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Because the public approval is so high in deportation.",
      "SEN. PADILLA: It depends on how you ask the question. If you ask the same people, do they think we should maintain due process in the United States of America, the answer is overwhelmingly yes. Do 'Dreamers' deserve better than the limbo that they find themselves in? Overwhelmingly, on a bipartisan basis, yes. And so I think it's important to break down three things. Number one, do we need a safe and secure, orderly, humane border? Absolutely, no disagreement. People seeking to come to the United States, whether it's to seek asylum on work pieces, etc., we definitely have to modernize that system and be more strategic in those capacities. But we can't forget the millions of long term residents, people who have been here, working, paying taxes, raising families, buying homes, contributing to the strength of our economy. They deserve better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "You are the ranking member on the Senate Rules Committee which oversees the Capitol Police. What if anything can you tell us about the state of security for lawmakers, given what's happening in Minnesota?",
      "SEN. PADILLA",
      "Look, a lot of questions, a lot of concerns, and work directly with both the US Capitol Police and the Senate Sergeant at Arms, and they're doing what they need to do to ensure the safety of members of Congress. But I also think it's more than appropriate to step back and say, why are tensions so high? Not just in Los Angeles, but throughout the country. And I can't help but point to the beginning of not just the first Trump term, but the beginning of the campaign, the tone with which the President had launched his first campaign for President, served throughout his first term, and continues in this term, for a cabinet secretary during a press conference to not be able or be willing to de escalate a situation when I was trying to ask a question that's just indicative--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You wanted her to say, wait a second, I know who he is. Calm down. Let him go. Is that what you're saying?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: The vast majority of people in that room knew who I was. I was escorted into that room by an FBI agent and a National Guard's member. It's the Los Angeles press corps. It said United States Senate on the chest of my polo.",

      "Update: The suspect was taken into custody Sunday evening. Read more here.",
      "For the second straight day, law enforcement officials are searching for 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter in the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses.",
      "Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman\u00a0was shot and killed at her Brooklyn Park home early Saturday morning, according to a report from the Hennepin County medical examiner. Her husband Mark was shot at the home and died at the hospital. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were shot and wounded roughly 5 miles away at their home in Champlin. Both lawmakers were members of the Democratic Party, representing the northwest corner of the Twin Cities.",
      "According to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Boelter stands at 6-foot-1, weighs roughly 220 pounds and has brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen Saturday morning in Minneapolis, wearing a light-colored cowboy hat, dark long-sleeve shirt, light pants and carrying a dark bag.",
      "If anyone sees Boelter, officials urge people not to approach him, and to call 911. He should be considered \"armed and dangerous,\" Superintendent Drew Evans with the Minnesota BCA said. Evans added that investigators believe Boelter is working to leave the Twin Cities area.",
      "\"We still don't know if additional people are involved, but this individual is the one that we're looking as a person of interest right now. But there may be other people with him and we would like to speak to anybody that may have had contact with him at any point in time,\" Evans said.",
      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a photo Saturday afternoon that appears to show Boelter standing outside of one of the lawmakers' homes, wearing a mask and dressed like a police officer.",
      "Authorities said Sunday morning they found a vehicle belonging to Boelter in Sibley County, about 60 miles southwest of where the shootings occurred. An emergency alert sent to residents asked them to lock their doors and secure their vehicles while law enforcement searches the area.",
      "The FBI says it is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Boelter's arrest and conviction.",
      "Anyone with information about Boelter's whereabouts is asked to call the tipline at 877-996-6222 or email\u00a0bca.tips@state.mn.us.",
      "\"This was a deliberate and violent attack on public servants and their families. We are working with our law enforcement partners and using every available resource to locate and apprehend Vance Boelter. We urge anyone with information to come forward\u2014no detail is too small. The public's vigilance is critical in bringing this individual to justice,\" said FBI Minneapolis Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston Sr.",
      "What we know about Vance Boelter",
      "Boelter's known address is a rural home in Sibley County, near the town of Green Isle.",
      "He works as the director of security patrols at Praetorian Guard Security Services. He previously worked as a general manager at a convenience store chain and at a food manufacturer, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "In 2016, Boelter was appointed as a private sector representative to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Council by former Gov. Mark Dayton. He served until 2019, when he was appointed by Gov. Tim Walz as a business member on the Governor's Workforce Development Board. His term ended in January of 2023, according to state records.",
      "Records show Hoffman served on the same 60-member board during both of Boelter's terms. The board advises the governor and the state legislature on policies aimed at strengthening Minnesota's workforce.",
      "In a press conference, authorities said they were investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman. Evans said there is \"certainly some overlap with some public meetings\" between Hoffman and Boelter, but that they had not determined \"the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.\"",
      "He had been living most recently in a home in north Minneapolis, according to a law enforcement source close to the investigation.",
      "Officials said Brooklyn Park police arrived at Hortman's home around 3:35 a.m. and found a police SUV with emergency lights on. The suspect then exited Hortman's home and exchanged gunfire with officers before fleeing on foot. Investigators said they believed the suspect was dressed like a police officer.",
      "There was an extensive list of possible targets among writings found in Boelter's vehicle. The list named more than 50 individuals, including officials outside of Minnesota, as well as abortion rights advocates and abortion facilities.",
      "There were also fliers in his car referencing a \"No Kings\" rally. Following the shootings, officials canceled all \"No Kings\" protests that had been planned in the state for Saturday, though thousands still attended the rally in St. Paul.",

    "story": [
      "Miami\u00a0\u2014 Josefina Muralles works a part-time overnight shift as a receptionist at a Miami Beach condominium so that during the day she can care for her three kids, her aging mother, and her brother, who is paralyzed.",
      "She helps her mother feed, bathe, and give medicine to her adult brother, Rodrigo Muralles, who has epilepsy and became disabled after contracting COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "\"He lives because we feed him and take care of his personal needs,\" said Josefina Muralles, 41. \"He doesn't say, 'I need this or that.' He has forgotten everything.\"",
      "Though her husband works full time, the arrangement means their household income is just above the federal poverty line \u2014 too high to qualify for Florida's Medicaid program but low enough to make Muralles and her husband eligible for subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Next year, Muralles said, she and her husband may not be able to afford that health insurance coverage, which has paid for her prescription blood thinners, cholesterol medication, and two surgeries, including one to treat a genetic disorder.",
      "Extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic \u2014 which reduced the premiums Muralles and her husband paid by more than half, to $30 a month \u2014 are in place only through Dec. 31. Without enhanced subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise by more than 75% on average, with bills for people in some states more than doubling, according to estimates from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Florida and Texas would be hit especially hard, as they have more people enrolled in the marketplace than other states. Some of their congressional districts alone, especially in South Florida, have more people signed up for Obamacare than entire states.",
      "Like many of the more than 24 million Americans enrolled in the insurance marketplace this year, Muralles was unaware that the enhanced subsidies are slated to expire. She said she cannot afford a premium hike because inflation has already eaten into her household's budget.",
      "\"The rent is going up,\" she said. \"The water bill is going up.\"",
      "Low-income enrollees like the Muralles couple would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums if enhanced subsidies expire.",
      "Middle-income enrollees who earn more than four times the federal poverty line would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Those middle-income enrollees (who earn at least $62,600 for a single person in 2025) are disproportionately older, self-employed, and living in rural areas.",
      "Julio Fuentes, president of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said many of his organization's members are small business owners who rely on Obamacare for health coverage.",
      "\"It's either this or nothing,\" he said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would, by 2034, increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million. In tandem with changes to Medicaid in the House of Representatives' reconciliation bill and the Trump administration's proposed rules for the marketplace, including toughening income verification and shortening enrollment periods, it would increase the number of uninsured people by 16 million over that time period.",
      "A study by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Hispanic and Black people would see greater coverage losses than other groups if the extra subsidies lapse.",
      "Fuentes noted that about 5 million Hispanics are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, and that President Trump won the Hispanic vote in Florida in 2024. He hopes the president and congressional Republicans see extending the enhanced subsidies as a way to hold on to those voters.",
      "\"This is probably a good way, or a good start, to possibly grow that base even more,\" he said.",
      "Enrollment in the marketplace has grown faster since 2020 in the states won by Mr. Trump in 2024. A recent KFF survey found that 45% of Americans who buy their own health insurance identify as or lean Republican, including 3 in 10 who identify as Make America Great Again supporters. Smaller shares identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents (35%) or do not lean toward either party (20%).",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said the rules proposed by the Trump administration, combined with the provisions in the House-passed budget bill, would \"strengthen the ACA marketplace.\" He noted that the CBO projects the legislation would reduce premiums for some plans about 12% on average by 2034 \u2014 but out-of-pocket costs would rise or remain the same for most subsidized ACA consumers.",
      "\"Democrats know Americans broadly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, as The One, Big, Beautiful Bill does, which is why they are desperately trying to change the conversation,\" Desai said.",
      "But Lauren Aronson, executive director of Keep Americans Covered, a group in Washington, D.C., representing health insurers, hospitals, physicians, and patient advocates, said it is critical to raise awareness about the likely impact of losing the enhanced subsidies, which are also known as advanced premium tax credits. She is encouraged that Democrats have proposed legislation to extend the enhanced tax credits, and that some Republican senators have voiced support.",
      "What worries Aronson most is that the Republican-controlled Congress is more focused on extending tax cuts than enhanced subsidies, she said. The current bill extending the 2017 tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO, while making the enhanced subsidies permanent would increase the deficit by $358 billion over roughly the same period.",
      "\"Congress is moving forward on a tax reconciliation package that purports to benefit working families,\" Aronson said. \"But if you don't take care of the tax credits, working families will be left holding the bag.\"",
      "Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health policy think tank, said the enhanced subsidies were supposed to be a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people at risk of losing coverage.",
      "Instead, he said, the enhanced subsidies facilitated fraud because enrollees did not need to verify their income eligibility to receive zero-premium plans if they reported incomes at or near the federal poverty level.",
      "The enhanced subsidies also worsen health inflation, discourage employers from offering health insurance benefits, and crowd out alternative models, such as short-term insurance and Farm Bureau plans, Blase said.",
      "\"Permitting these subsidies to expire would just be going back to Obamacare as it was written,\" Blase said. \"That is a more efficient program than the program that we have now.\"",
      "New rules for the marketplace proposed by the Trump administration in March are already designed to address fraud, said Anna Howard, a policy expert with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which advocates for increased health insurance coverage. Howard said extending the enhanced tax credits would help ensure that people who are legitimately eligible for coverage can get it.",
      "\"We don't want to see over 5 million people be kicked off their health insurance coverage out of fears of fraud when the policies being proposed don't necessarily address fraud,\" she said.",
      "Without affordable premiums, many consumers will turn to short-term health plans, health care cost-sharing ministries, and other forms of coverage that do not have the benefits or protections of the health law, she said.",
      "\"These are plans that don't provide coverage for prescription drugs, or they have lifetime and annual limits,\" she said. \"For a cancer patient, those plans don't work.\"",
      "Though the enhanced subsidies do not expire until the end of the year, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would prefer Congress to act by fall to avoid confusion during open enrollment, said David Merritt, a senior vice president. Insurers are preparing rates to meet state deadlines. By October, consumers will receive 60-day plan renewal notices with their 2026 premiums.",
      "Without enhanced subsidies, Merritt said, competition in the marketplace will wither, leading to fewer coverage options and higher prices, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility and where Obamacare enrollment spiked during the past four years, like Florida and Texas. \"Voters and patients are really going to see the impact,\" he said.",
      "Republican and Democratic representatives for some of the Florida congressional districts with the highest numbers of people in the marketplace did not respond to repeated interview requests.",
      "Muralles, of North Miami, Florida, said she wants her representatives to work in the interest of constituents like herself, who need health insurance coverage to care for their families.",
      "\"Now is the time to prove to us that they are with us,\" Muralles said. \"When everybody's healthy, everybody goes to work, everybody can pay taxes, everybody can have a better life.\"",

      "\"Across the country we have seen instances of rioting, looting, arson, destruction of property, assaults on officers (federal, state, and local), and obstruction of federal immigration enforcement efforts,\" the memo said. \"[T]he Department has zero tolerance for any such criminal behavior.\"",
      "The memo instructs U.S. Attorneys' Offices to \"diligently monitor these enforcement efforts by maintaining regular comms with their DHS and DOJ agency counterparts.\"",
      "The memo added that leadership \"should prepare their offices to provide legal support for operations in their districts. One or two duty [assistant U.S. attorneys] is insufficient. All [U.S. Attorney Office] leadership and the entire Criminal Division should be on standby. There should be no bottleneck of referrals for complaints and legal process.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors were instructed to \"prioritize\" any requests for search warrants or complaints in these types of cases and \"push out press releases whenever you file charges in these matters.\"",
      "The Justice Department has already filed a series of criminal cases that allege obstruction or criminal activity related to immigration operations, and has vowed to prosecute anyone who assaults officers or interferes with ongoing immigration actions amid protests in Los Angeles and around the country.",

According to a Homeland Security Investigation officer's sworn affidavit, Huerta sat down in front of a vehicular gate to a staging ground for Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations that were ongoing nearby. The complaint alleged he yelled to other protesters to \"stop the vehicles,\" and said, \"It's a public sidewalk, they can't stop us.\"",
      "In a separate case, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey has filed a felony criminal case against Rep. LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat, who was attempting to visit an immigration facility in Newark on May 9. Prosecutors alleged McIver sought to stop federal agents from arresting the mayor of Newark during the confrontation. \"During her continued attempts to thwart the arrest, McIver slammed her forearm into the body of one law enforcement officer and also reached out and tried to restrain that officer by forcibly grabbing him,\" the Justice Department said. \"McIver also used each of her forearms to forcibly strike a second officer.\"",
      "McIver responded to the criminal indictment in a statement: \"The facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation.\"",
      "When asked for comment about the new memo to prosecutors, a Justice Department spokesman told CBS News, \"As we've said repeatedly, the Department respects the right to peacefully protest & assemble to engage on important issues. However, the Department and its 94 US Attorney Offices will not tolerate unlawful violence & destruction of property. We are prepared to respond accordingly.\"",

      "Lawyers there have been assigned menial research tasks and left with hours of idle time \u2014 an effort they view as intended to coerce them into resigning, those with knowledge of the task force said.",
      "\"This is a hard thing to talk about,\" said Tom Mariani, an environmental litigator who resigned rather than accept reassignment to the rubber room. \"I can't tell you how much personal distress I feel over how these folks were treated.\"",
      "The term rubber room is an allusion to now-infamous \"reassignment centers\" where New York City officials transferred public school teachers and administrators who some considered burned out or incompetent, but who could not be fired because of union rules. But in this case, those being transferred have been elite veteran attorneys from the Civil Rights Division, the National Security Division and the Environment and Natural Resources Division whose performance had not previously been questioned.",
      "For months they did little or no work, were cut off from other Justice Department litigators who were actually working on sanctuary city cases and had no supervisors they could turn to for support, those familiar with the assignment told CBS News. At least four of those assigned to the task force have filed formal complaints with the Justice Department's inspector general alleging waste, fraud and abuse, CBS News has learned.",
      "That office declined comment on whether there is an active investigation into the treatment of the task force lawyers.",
      "None would comment for this story, fearing retaliation from the administration. But public interest lawyers and government watchdogs say their experience stands apart as an example of how callously civil servants who have dedicated their professional lives to public service have been treated.",
      "\"For the first time in modern U.S. history, we are witnessing purely vindictive and retaliatory actions being taken against non-partisan civil servants who simply performed their jobs consistent with law and policy during prior time,\" said Mark Zaid, a Washington lawyer who represents government whistleblowers.",
      "A new president, a new assignment: The Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group",
      "The emails began arriving in the third week of January from then-Acting Attorney General James McHenry, landing in the inboxes of some of the Justice Department's most senior career attorneys, notifying them that they were being transferred to the newly created Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group and had 15 days to decide whether to take the new assignment or resign.",
      "Among those told they were being transferred to the task force were the two most senior career lawyers in the National Security Division, George Toscas and Eun Young Choi. Toscas, who was one of the most knowledgeable counterterrorism lawyers in the federal government, took personal leave instead of showing up at the task force offices. Choi, a highly experienced cyber and crypto prosecutor, also took personal leave. Both have since left the department.",
      "Mariani, who was the chief of the enforcement section of the Environment and Natural Resources section, was a 40-year veteran of the Justice Department who had reached retirement age. He said he opted to exit rather than take the new assignment.",
      "Those who did accept the assignment arrived in the isolated offices during what some called a Department of Justice in turmoil, former senior prosecutors told CBS News.",
      "Puzzles and streaming shows",
      "In this environment, several people familiar with the matter told CBS News that lawyers assigned to the new sanctuary cities section felt they had few options. They showed up for their first day \u2014 Feb. 12 \u2014 at a satellite building of the Justice Department known informally as 2Con for its address at 2 Constitution Avenue. Their handler was Kendra Wharton, an associate deputy attorney general who had worked on multiple legal cases involving President Trump before joining the department.",
      "Wharton rarely, if ever, showed up at the 10th floor office at 2Con. Some lawyers said they never saw her at the rubber room in the nearly three months they were on the task force.",
      "In the first few weeks, she communicated with the group on video calls to give them their assignments. On Feb. 13, at 9:30 a.m., Wharton called in from Justice Department headquarters while the attorneys gathered around a monitor. According to a source familiar with the call, she asked them to research the sanctuary city policies in several heavily Democratic states. The lawyers asked if they could contact the Civil Division lawyers handling the litigation in those states, but Wharton told them she was to be the single point of contact.",
      "\"A 10th grader could have done it,\" one source familiar with the work remarked bitterly.",
      "Two weeks later, Wharton asked the lawyers to compile information on three additional states. On March 5, Wharton asked for \"emergency\" follow up on a single city, according to one source. A few days later she added one more blue state to the places she wanted studied.",
      "After that, Wharton received a different mandate, and she is no longer supervising the lawyers, a Justice Department official said. Work in the rubber room slowed to a halt.",
      "\"Having worked around the clock for years, if not decades, the imposed idleness was something I could not get used to,\" said one lawyer who was assigned to the task force.",
      "The lawyers continued coming into 2Con each morning but had to find activities to occupy their time. Some completed jigsaw puzzles and streamed television shows like \"The Last of Us\" and \"Succession.\" One lawyer, Deborah Harris, whose previous job had been head of the Environment and Natural Resources Division's crimes section, could be seen practicing Italian on Duolingo.",
      "Reached for comment, Harris confirmed some details about some of the ways she passed her time in the rubber room but declined to say anything more.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said, \"The Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group is focused on important work to advance top priorities of this administration.\"",
      "Turmoil inside the Justice Department",
      "The rubber room is just the latest in a series of personnel moves that critics of the administration have tracked. Some have been demoted within their own units. Bruce Swartz, the highly respected head of the Office of International Affairs, was notified by email that he was being transferred to the office's training program, a job that fell several rungs below his position. He opted to resign.",
      "Nearly a dozen prosecutors in the Public Integrity Section and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York quit rather than sign onto legal actions they objected to \u2014 such as the decision in February to drop the prosecution of New York Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "And at the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office, the interim top prosecutor fired or demoted dozens of assistant U.S. attorneys who had won convictions against hundreds of rioters who assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Those who did not resign were given jobs typically assigned to junior prosecutors, sometimes referred to as \"baby AUSAs,\" like handling misdemeanors in D.C. Superior Court or working in the office's intake section screening cases for prosecution or alternative action.",
      "Harold Koh, Sterling professor of international law and a former dean of Yale Law School, served in the Justice and State Departments under four presidents from both parties. For him, the rooting out of so many lawyers represents more than the personal devastation of these government professionals \u2014 it would be a loss for the American people for years to come.",
      "\"Apart from the shabby, petty treatment of career government officials and the degradation of government institutions, the greatest injury to the American people is the harm caused by the destruction of preparedness for dealing with the next crisis,\" Koh said of this administration.",
      "\"The best and the brightest have always wanted to go to Justice,\" he added, \"but who would want to go to a place like that now?\"",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Apex predators, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, eventually arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroid dinosaurs called Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, the study's researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

    "summary": "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The Joro spider, Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly have company this summer.",
      "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
      "Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,\" Suiter recently told the university.",
      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,\" the service says.",

      "But during SpaceX troubleshooting to find and fix the rocket's propellant leak, NASA engineers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to plug an air leak aboard the International Space Station in a Russian vestibule known as the PrK. The PrK serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "\"Teams met today and we will not be launching Axiom-4 tomorrow,\" flight controllers in Houston radioed the ISS. \"We are assessing a new launch date. This is due to the ongoing PrK investigation. So I don't have a new launch date right now, but we will not be launching tomorrow and docking Saturday.\"",
      "In a blog post, NASA said cosmonauts aboard the station \"recently performed inspections of the pressurized module's interior surfaces, sealed some additional areas of interest, and measured the current leak rate. Following this effort, the segment now is holding pressure.\"",
      "The post went on to say  the Axiom-4 delay will provide \"additional time for NASA and (the Russian space agency) Roscosmos to evaluate the situation and determine whether any additional troubleshooting is necessary.\"",
      "Launched in July 2000 atop a Russian Proton rocket, Zvezda was the third module to join the growing space station, providing a command center for Russian cosmonauts, crew quarters, the aft docking port and two additional ports now occupied by airlock and research modules.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019, and has been openly discussed ever since by NASA during periodic reviews and space station news briefings. The leak rate has varied, but has stayed in the neighborhood of around 1-to-2 pounds per day.",
      "\"The station is not young,\" astronaut Mike Barratt said last November during a post flight news conference. \"It's been up there for quite a while, and you expect some wear and tear, and we're seeing that in the form of some cracks that have formed.\"",
      "The Russians have made a variety of attempts to patch a suspect crack and other possible sources of leakage, but air has continued to escape into space.",
      "In November, Bob Cabana, a former astronaut and NASA manager who chaired the agency's ISS Advisory Committee, said U.S. and Russian engineers \"don't have a common understanding of what the likely root cause is, or the severity of the consequences of these leaks.\"",
      "\"The Russian position is that the most probable cause of the PrK cracks is high cyclic fatigue caused by micro vibrations,\" Cabana said. \"NASA believes the PrK cracks are likely multi-causal including pressure and mechanical stress, residual stress, material properties and environmental exposures.",
      "\"The Russians believe that continued operations are safe, but they can't prove to our satisfaction that they are, and the US believes that it's not safe, but we can't prove that to the Russian satisfaction that that's the case.\"",
      "As an interim step, the hatch leading to the PrK and the station's aft docking compartment is closed during daily operations and only opened when the Russians need to unload a visiting Progress cargo ship.",
      "And as an added precaution on NASA's part, whenever the hatch to the PrK and docking compartment is open, a hatch between the Russian and U.S. segments of the station is closed.",
      "\"We've taken a very conservative approach to close a hatch between the US side and the Russian side during those time periods,\" Barratt said. \"It's not a comfortable thing, but it is the best agreement between all the smart people on both sides. And it's something that we crew live with and enact.\"",
      "Cabana said last year that the Russians do not believe \"catastrophic disintegration of the PrK is realistic (but) NASA has expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the PrK and the possibility of a catastrophic failure.\"",

      "\"We almost immediately started getting 911 calls for rescue of people being trapped,\" Lou Vargo, Ohio County's emergency management director, said at a news conference Sunday. \"During this time, we had major infrastructure damage to roads, bridges, and highways, where we couldn't respond to a lot of incidents.

      "There were about 2,500 power outages in the county as of Sunday afternoon, the governor said. Restoration efforts were hampered by natural gas leaks that have to be fixed first, officials said.",

Officials said he was found hiding in the woods near his home in Green Isle, in Sibley County. He is facing murder charges for the killing of the Hortmans and attempted murder charges for the shootings of the Hoffmans.",

      "What happened at the homes of Minnesota lawmakers?",
      "Police first responded to a call of a shooting at Hoffman's home in Champlin at around 2 a.m. local time Saturday, Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said in the briefing. Life-saving measures were provided to Hoffman and his wife and they were taken to an area hospital, where they underwent surgery to treat gunshot wounds, Evans said.",

      "Two Brooklyn Park police officers who went to Hortman's home saw what appeared to be a police vehicle parked in front of the house with its emergency lights on, and a police officer leaving the house, Bruley said. The vehicle \"looked exactly like an SUV squad car,\" equipped with emergency lights, Bruley said. The individual was wearing a vest with a Taser, badge and other equipment, Bruley said. Bruley said the individual appeared to have knocked on the door of the home.",
      "The Brooklyn Park officers confronted the individual, who Burley said \"immediately\" fired and exchanged gunshots with officers, Bruley said. The individual then retreated into the home, Bruley said. The police officers then entered the home and saw that Hortman's husband had been shot. They attempted to render first aid, but he was pronounced dead. A drone was then used to search the rest of the home and found Hortman dead inside.",

      "A stack of \"No Kings\" flyers was also found inside the vehicle, the Minnesota State Patrol said on social media. The flyers reference the anti-Trump protests that took place\u00a0in cities nationwide on Saturday. After the shooting, statewide \"No Kings\" events planned for Minnesota were canceled. Law enforcement appeared concerned the suspect was planning to target the protests, and the Minnesota State Patrol asked that people planning to attend the events avoid them out of an abundance of caution.",

He was arrested near his home in Green Isle, Sibley County, on Sunday night, sources told CBS News. Multiple local police and sheriff departments, along with state and federal agencies were involved in the nearly 43-hour-long manhunt.",
      "Investigators had been searching in the area after a vehicle belonging to Boelter was found. Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said that one officer thought he saw Boelter run into the woods and a large perimeter was set up. Investigators later got further information that Boelter had been seen in the woods, and multiple SWAT teams were called in, according to Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendant Drew Evans and Bruley. After authorities closed in on Boelter, he \"crawled to law enforcement teams,\" according to Minnesota State Patrol Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger.",

      "Boelter is\u00a0listed\u00a0as director of security patrols on the website of Praetorian Guard Security Services, where his wife is named president and CEO. However, Boelter's roommate told CBS News that, while it was the suspect's \"dream\" to have his own security company, he did not actually have one.",
      "\"It seems he bought the two cars for the security company, but he had no clients and he had no business,\" the roommate told CBS News. \"He had no employees and wasn't doing any security for anyone.\"",

In an undated video posted online, he\u00a0said\u00a0that while working to develop projects in Congo, he started working at Minnesota funeral homes \"to help pay the bills.\"",

Walz reappointed him that year as a business member, a position he held until January 2023.",

      "The board advises the governor and legislature on policies aimed at strengthening Minnesota's workforce and improving its competitiveness, according to its\u00a0website.",
      "Boelter's roommate, in response to rumors circulating online about the suspect's politics, told CBS News, \"He's not a Democrat. He would be offended if people called him a Democrat,\" adding that Boelter \"was a Trump supporter, voted for Trump,\" and was happy President Trump won the 2024 election.",
      "In a news conference Saturday, authorities said they were investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman.",
      "Evans said there is \"certainly some overlap with some public meetings\" between Hoffman and Boelter, but that they had not determined \"the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.\"",

      "Walz called the deaths of Hortman and her husband \"a political assassination.\" In a later statement, Walz said that Minnesota had lost a \"great leader\" and that he had \"lost a friend.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 05:00:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Utilities are racing to build data centers to meet surging demand for AI and other tech services. Ratepayers will pick up the tab, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "New Jersey residents got some bad news earlier this year when the state's public utilities board warned that their electricity bills could surge up to 20% starting on June 1. A key driver in that rate hike: data centers.",
      "The spread of these large-scale computing facilities across the U.S. amid growing demand for artificial intelligence, data storage and other technology services is projected to increase electricity consumption to record highs in the coming years, according to experts.",
      "A report from Schneider Electric, a company that specializes in digital automation and energy management, projects that electricity demand will increase 16% by 2029, mainly due to the proliferation of data centers. Most data centers rely on the nation's electrical grid for energy, meaning it will be Americans ratepayers who pick up the tab, Mark Wolfe, executive director of the\u00a0National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that represents states on energy issues.",
      "\"As utilities race to meet skyrocketing demand from AI and cloud computing, they're building new infrastructure and raising rates, often without transparency or public input,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"That means higher electricity bills for everyday households, while tech companies benefit from sweetheart deals behind closed doors.\"",
      "More data centers, more power",
      "Thousands of data centers now dot the country, with the\u00a0largest concentrations\u00a0in Virginia, California and Texas. The number of data centers in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to a report from Environment America, a network of environmental groups.",
      "It's not just the number of data centers that are expected to rise, but the size. \"The trend has been bigger data centers,\" Dave Turk, the\u00a0former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0\"They tend to be more energy efficient.\"",
      "Spurring that expansion is the rapid growth of \"generative\" AI companies that are consuming vast amounts of electricity to train so-called Large Language Models like ChatGPT and power. AI searches use 10 times more electricity than normal internet searches, according to a\u00a0study from the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\"AI is an increasing part of data centers and certainly responsible for increased electricity demand,\" Turk said.",
      "Data centers, which contain thousands of computer servers, networking gear and other infrastructure, also require power to cool their systems and keep them from overheating.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at asset management firm Apollo Global Management, estimates that data centers will require an additional 18 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. To put that into context, New York City power demand is about 6 gigawatts.",
      "About 4.4% of U.S. electricity went to power data centers in 2023, according to a Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. Not all of that demand is related to AI, but it represents a portion, Turk said.",
      "Other factors pushing up prices",
      "The spread of data centers isn't the only reason U.S. electricity prices are surging. The price of natural gas, inflation, ongoing electrification of buildings and vehicles, and other factors also play an important role. But utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models.",
      "For example, when Dominion Energy, one of the Virginia's largest utilities, in April\u00a0proposed\u00a0a price hike of $8.51 per month in 2026, the company also floated the idea of a \"new rate class for high energy users, including data centers.\"",
      "Electricity prices have risen 4.5% in the last year, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Labor Department, and are estimated to\u00a0surge this summer. Energy costs also drift higher if a Republican-backed budget package, dubbed the \"big beautiful bill,\" is passed and signed into law by President Trump. Analysts from Rhodium Group\u00a0predict\u00a0that the bill, which would repeal a slate of tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, could increase a family's energy expenditures by nearly $400 a year.",
      "Beyond price increases, the heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to experts. In a recent\u00a0report, the North American Electric Reliability Corp said that facilities that service AI and cryptocurrency companies are being developed at a faster pace than the power plants and transmission lines to support them, \"resulting in lower system stability.",
      "PJM, a grid operator in 13 states plus Washington, D.C., cited data center demand as one of the factors that could lead to capacity shortages in its 2025 forecast.",

      "Asked as he was departing Washington, D.C., for the Group of 7, or G7, Summit in Canada how the U.S. was working to de-escalate the conflict, President Trump told reporters on Sunday, \"I think it's time for a deal, and we'll see what happens.\"",

U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff had been slated to travel to Oman on Sunday for a sixth round of direct and indirect negotiations.

    "story": [
      "J.J. Spaun turned a sloppy mess of a U.S. Open at wet and nasty Oakmont into a thing of beauty at the end Sunday with two stunning shots that carried him to his first major championship.",
      "First came his driver on the 314-yard 17th hole onto the green\u00a0for a birdie that gave him the lead. Needing two putts from 65 feet on the 18th to win, he finished his storybook Open by\u00a0holing the longest putt all week at Oakmont\u00a0for birdie and a 2-over 72.",
      "That made him the only player to finish under par at 1-under 279. It gave him a two-shot victory over Robert MacIntyre of Scotland.",
      "And it made Spaun, the 36-year-old Californian who resembles the late Pittsburgh Steelers great Franco Harris, a major champion in only his second U.S. Open.",
      "\"I never thought I would be here holding this trophy,\" said Spaun, who finished last year at No. 119 in the world with only one PGA Tour title in his career. \"I always had aspirations and dreams. I never knew what my ceiling was. I'm just trying to be the best golfer I can be.\"",
      "It was calamity for so many others.",
      "Sam Burns had a two-shot lead going to the 11th tee, made a double bogey from a divot in the first cut and from a lie in the fairway so wet he thought he deserved relief. He shot 78.",
      "Adam Scott, trying to become the first player to go more than 11 years between major titles, was tied for the lead with five holes to play. One of the best drivers could no longer find the fairway. He played them in 5 over and shot 79.",
      "\"I missed the fairway. I hadn't done that all week really. Then I did, and I paid the price and lost a lot of shots out there,\" Scott said.",
      "Carlos Ortiz and Tyrrell Hatton also slashed away in slushy lies, all making mistakes that cost them a chance to survive this beast of day.",
      "The rain that put Oakmont on the edge of being unplayable might have saved Spaun.",
      "One shot behind at the start of the day, he opened with five bogeys in six holes with some horrific breaks, none worse than hitting the pin on the second hole and seeing it spin back to the fairway. And then came a rain delay of 1 hour, 37 minutes.",
      "\"The weather delay changed the whole vibe of the day,\" Spaun said.",
      "Remarkably, he made only one bogey the rest of the way.",
      "But oh, that finish.",
      "MacIntyre, the 28-year-old from Oban toughened by the Scottish game of Shinty, became the new target. He also struggled at the start and fell nine shots behind at one point. But he birdied the 17th and split the fairway on the 18th for a key par, a 68 and the clubhouse lead.",
      "Three groups later, Spaun delivered what looked like the winner, a powerful fade that rolled onto the green like a putt and settled 18 feet behind the cup.",
      "And then the final putt \u2014 no one made a longer one all week. He was helped by Viktor Hovland being on the same line and going first. Spaun rapped it through the soaked turf, walked to the left to watch it break right toward the hole and watched it drop as thousands of rain-soaked spectators erupted.",
      "He raised both arms and tossed his putter, jumping into the arms of caddie Mark Carens.",
      "The celebration carried into those who lost the battle.",
      "MacIntyre, so close to becoming Scotland's first major champion since Paul Lawrie in 1999,\u00a0sat in scoring in front of a TV and applauded.",
      "Hatton was talking with reporters, bemoaning a bad break on the 17th ended his chances of winning. He watched the Spaun's putt and it brightened his mood.",
      "\"Unbelievable. What a putt to win. That's incredible,\" he said. \"I'm sad about how I finished, but I'm very happy for J.J. To win a major in that fashion is amazing.\"",
      "Hovland, who shot 73 to finish third, saw it all \u2014 the putt at the end, the bogeys at the start.",
      "\"After his start, it just looked like he was out of it immediately,\" Hovland said. \"Everyone came back to the pack. I wasn't expecting that really. I thought I had to shoot maybe 3-under par today to have a good chance, but obviously the conditions got really, really tough, and this golf course is just a beast.\"",
      "Hatton (72) and Ortiz (73), both part of LIV Golf and in serious contention at a major for the first time, tied for fourth along with Cameron Young (70). The consolation for Ortiz was getting into the Masters next year.",
      "Scottie Scheffler, 10 shots behind early in the final round, was somehow still part of the conversation on the back nine. But he missed far too many birdie chances even three-putting from 12 feet on the 11th hole. The world's No. 1 player finished with a 70 to tie for seventh with Jon Rahm (67) and Burns, his best friend who will feel the sting.",

      "\"The victim sent $200 to the CashApp account but cancelled the payment after speaking with his father,\" Michael Digiacomo, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York, said in a public notice about the case. \"He then continued to receive multiple text messages from the same telephone number that made the threats.\"",
      "The affidavit reviewed by CBS News said agents eventually tracked down an IP address linked to Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., that had accessed the victim's account in October 2022. A security camera image in the affidavit allegedly shows Cole entering an AirBNB rental facility at the Capitol Hill address in October 2022.",
      "The affidavit said Cole's\u00a0mother, who is also a citizen of Ghana, had rented a space in the building through AirBNB that month. A judge has ordered Cole to be detained, pending trial. His next court hearing is scheduled for September in Buffalo federal court.",
      "Safety experts and federal law enforcement officials told CBS News that a growing number of these sextortion schemes are being executed by foreign nationals against children and young adults in the U.S. FBI records obtained by CBS News show a nearly 500% increase in reports of sextortion since 2019.",
      "The FBI and safety groups have been trying to raise awareness around cases like Cole's. Targets are increasingly young men. Experts say these victims are less likely to report the incidents.",
      "In some of the newest wave of sextortion cases, schemers lure children and young adults into sharing illicit photos by pretending to be someone who's about the same age. In other cases, including the one described in the charging documents against Cole, suspects are accused of hacking into the social media accounts of victims to obtain the illicit images.",
      "\"These cases are like something we've never seen before,\" said Lauren Coffen, director of the Exploited Children Division at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.",
      "\"We are used to people being able to reach out and engage and chat with children for sexual reasons. They wanted the images, they wanted to be able to maybe meet up,\" Coffen told CBS News. \"Now, they want money. And that's a totally different motivator than what we're used to seeing in exploitation.\"",
      "\"People have no idea how targeted our teenage boys are right now,\" Pauline Stuart told CBS News.",
      "Stuart's son, Ryan Last, died by suicide hours after a sextortion scheme was threatened against him in 2022. The Justice Department says Last's death showed the pervasiveness of international criminals in sextortion schemes. In an announcement in May, the department said four men in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire had been arrested on criminal charges related to their alleged role in an international sextortion scheme that targeted thousands of victims, including Last.",
      "\"The sad reality is this is not an uncommon event,\" said Digiacomo, whose office is prosecuting Cole's case. Though he would not comment on the details of the Cole investigation, Digiacomo said the pervasiveness of sextortion cases is troubling and largely unrecognized by some parents.",
      "\"Oftentimes in these cases, there are very young victims,\" Digiacomo told CBS News, \"The perpetrators will say 'Just send me the pictures and I'll leave you alone.' And the victims think (sending money) is the easy way out or the only way out.\"",
      "Digiacomo and the National Center for Missing Exploited Children both told CBS News that the international component of the conspiracies complicates efforts to track down and stop sextorters.",
      "According to the FBI affidavit in Cole's case, agents connected an iCloud account to Cole that included a note listing multiple Yahoo email addresses and passwords.",

      "Thousands of protesters across L.A. \u2014 where demonstrations have occurred in the past week over immigration raids \u2014 were largely peaceful throughout the day, but police issued a dispersal order near the city's downtown federal building after the crowd allegedly started throwing objects at officers.",
      "Police deployed smoke and ordered everyone to leave the area at roughly 3:55 p.m. local time. Aerial footage shows officers detaining several people, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "The gatherings were timed for the same day Mr. Trump will be attending a\u00a0military parade\u00a0in Washington, D.C., to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, and amid heightened tensions with National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to counter anti-ICE protests there.",
      "Saturday morning, Minnesota officials canceled all of the state's \"No Kings\" protests after\u00a0Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman\u00a0and her husband were killed and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded in politically motivated shootings targeting the Democratic lawmakers overnight.

      "\"So what do you say, Philly?\" Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland shouted to the crowd. \"Are you ready to fight back? Do you want a gangster state or do you want free speech in America?\"",
      "An estimated tens of thousands joined the \"No Kings\" demonstrations throughout Portland, Oregon, according to Portland police, but hours later, the city's police\u00a0declared a riot for several hours during a protest outside the ICE building.

      "What is No Kings Day?",
      "The \"No Kings\" theme was orchestrated by the\u00a050501 Movement, to support democracy and against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration. The name 50501 stands for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement.",

      "According to a statement by the organizers, the No Kings Day of Defiance is intended to reject authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics and the militarization of the country's democracy.",
      "The event was promoted by Walmart heiress Christy Walton, herself a billionaire, in a full-page advertisement she took out in The New York Times last Sunday. No Kings Day merchandise has cropped up for sale on Amazon, Temu and other online retailers.",

      "Organizers say that one march would go to the gates of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where Republican Gov.

    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California warned Sunday that if he, as a U.S. senator, could be forcibly removed from a Department of Homeland Security news conference, \"don't just imagine what they're capable of, but what they are doing when the cameras are not there\" to others.",
      "\"If that's how this administration responds to the senator with a question, don't just imagine what they're capable of, but what they are doing when the cameras are not there, to people without a title like United States senator, that cruel, disrespectful treatment of so many people who deserve much better,\" Padilla said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Padilla was removed on Thursday from a news conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles amid ongoing immigration raids and protests in the city. Last week, President Trump overrode California Gov. Gavin Newsom and sent in the National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to quell the protests.",
      "Noem was describing what she called the \"burdensome leadership\" of California's governor and the mayor of Los Angeles, when Padilla interrupted and attempted to ask a question before being pushed from the room. He could be heard yelling, \"I'm Sen. Alex Padilla and I have questions for the secretary,\" as he was forcefully escorted out of the room.",
      "Democrats on Capitol Hill and throughout the country expressed shock at the treatment of a U.S. senator, and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski called the incident \"horrible\" and \"not the America I know.\"",
      "Noem told reporters afterward that she \"wished that he would have reached out and identified himself and let us know who he was and that he wanted to talk.\"",
      "Los Angeles was among more than 2,000 cities nationwide that held protests Saturday against the Trump administration, which in L.A. resulted in police dispersing the crowd. Los Angeles Police Department officers said on a post to X that \"people in the crowd are throwing rocks, bricks, bottles and other objects\" when the march passed by the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building. Newsom on Saturday accused the Defense Department of using old images to promote the military presence.",
      "Padilla said Sunday that last week, he was supposed to have his own briefing with the same representatives of Northern Command in the same building as Noem's media event, but it was delayed due to the news conference. He said he asked if he could listen in because he does not feel Noem has provided \"substantive answers\" to questions to Congress, whether it be in formal requests via letters or in testimony before Congress.",
      "\"So to be able to ask a question of the secretary directly when they offered the meeting after the incident, I took it,\" Padilla said.",
      "Padilla said he wanted to ask about \"their justification for the federalization of the National Guard,\" which he considers \"not only not necessary, but counterproductive as we've seen this last week in Los Angeles.\"",
      "He also said he wanted to ask about the increasing number of stories of people who are \"undocumented, long-term residents of the United States who are otherwise law-abiding, working hard, paying taxes, raising families\" being targeted for deportation.",
      "Padilla said a \"key question\" he had for Noem was about how many criminals are being deported, which is who the Trump administration has claimed to be targeting.",
      "\"Of course, she had no data, had no answer,\" Padilla said. \"Promised to follow up. I hope, we'll see.\"",
      "Padilla added that it was the same reaction when he had the \"audacity to try to ask a question as a senator of a Cabinet secretary.\"",
      "\"The vast majority of people in that room knew who I was,\" Padilla said. \"I was escorted into that room by an FBI agent and a National Guard member. It's the Los Angeles press corps. It said United States Senate on the chest of my polo.\"",

      "But the U.S. has already done that with air defense systems and a warship, according to a U.S. military official. There are around 40,000 American troops in the Middle East, a powerful presence that aims to protect U.S. interests, including trade routes.",
      "But if Iran did try to strike American forces, the roughly 2,500 U.S. troops here in Iraq could be the most obvious target, since they're right next door. Iran previously targeted U.S. forces in Iraq with ballistic missiles back in 2020 in retaliation for the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force.",
      "No U.S. service members were killed on that occasion. Since then, a series of shifts has reshaped the Middle East and weakened Iran and its proxies, the war in Gaza, Israel's decimation of the leadership of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the collapse of the Syrian regime, and now Israel's surprise attack.",
      "If Iran does target American forces this time, it would be extremely risky, because it will likely draw a sharp response from the U.S., when Iran is already under attack.",

      "When it comes to what President Trump has said publicly, he seems to be indicating not just that the U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, but he's saying this is not America's fight unless Iran hits the U.S.",
      "Should it be such a bright line?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, what the president said in his overnight post was a clear message to the ayatollahs, that, if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the U.S. military in a way no one's ever seen.",
      "That's a clear deterrent message, setting aside the threat that the nuclear program poses to Israel and to the United States, because, let's remember, the Iranian regime has been terrorizing Americans. It's killed thousands of Americans. It's taken them hostage. It still chants \"Death to America.\" And it's building missiles that can strike not just our troops or our friends in the region, but soon enough here in the United States as well.",
      "And that's why President Trump has been consistent for his 10 years in political life that we cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. We cannot allow them to have a path to a nuclear weapon with uranium enrichment. That's the deal that he was trying to negotiate for the last two months.",
      "But, as he said early last week, Iran was simply too stubborn. They weren't willing to come to the table and negotiate. And I have to disagree with the reporter who said that Israel strikes in Iran ended those negotiations. It was Iran's \u2013 Iran's stubbornness that ended them.",
      "President Trump was clear about that. And he is still clear that there is time, if they want to come back to negotiate an end to the uranium enrichment program, that he would accept that. But he's given them chance after chance, as he said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, in terms of the line he's drawing on military force, should the U.S. involvement be purely defensive and deterrent, or should the U.S. be willing to be engaged in these military operations?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I don't think he's drawn that line. He's been very clear that all options remain on the table to defend our own people, to support Israel\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He hasn't said that.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But he \u2013 well, he said that for 10 years, and he said it for months leading up to this moment.",
      "He said that Iran can make a deal and live happily without death, or there will be bombing. So, I think he's appropriately kept all options on the table. He made clear in the early days of this conflict, on Thursday night and Friday morning, that we back Israel to the hilt. There's almost 700,000 Americans in Israel at any time. So, of course, we're going to protect Israel, and that we have the best military technology in the world.",
      "And he said that he has proudly provided Israel with those weapons, both in his first term and in this term as well. So, we back Israel to the hilt all the way. But he's appropriately keeping all options on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's emphasizing again and again, this isn't us. This isn't America. This isn't an American operation.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: So, so far in this operation, we have not been involved in offensive strikes. We've been involved in other ways, through our provision of Israel with weapons over the years or our defense of Israel and its citizens and our citizens in Israel.",
      "Now, he has said his objective remains the same, which is Iran's nuclear disarmament. And he has said that that can happen still through a deal. I don't think\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He prefers diplomacy.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: And he would like Iran to come back to the table, I think, now that Iran sees that Israel and America mean business\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 and surrender its enrichment capabilities voluntarily. If that doesn't happen, though, I think these strikes are going to continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to the point, if it's really about destroying the nuclear program that Iran has, you know this very well, that there's this underground facility at Fordow, very deep, under a mountain.",
      "It's long been assessed that only the U.S. has the capability with a bunker-buster bomb to take it out. Should the United States offer that kind of massive ordnance penetrator to Israel to finish the job?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I'm not going to speculate about the methods that the United States or Israel might use\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But should they?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 to protect our own interests.",
      "I will simply say this. It is, as you say, widely known that Israel does not have heavy bombers. It doesn't have those 30,000-pound penetrating munitions. But, as we saw with Hezbollah last fall, as we saw in Iran on Thursday night, when the Mossad had infiltrated officers and agents and manufactured drones in Iran, Israel has more than a few tricks up their sleeve.",
      "And I wouldn't be surprised if Israel has other cards yet to play.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when it comes to differences in intelligence assessments, the U.S. intelligence that was made public in March said at the time the U.S. does not assess Iran's building a nuclear weapon and that the supreme leader has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended back in 2003.",
      "Was there more recent U.S. intel sharing or intel indicating that there was some kind of sprint for a bomb?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that seems a very different assessment from what Israel's claiming.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, unfortunately, Iran enriched a lot of the uranium to near weapons-grade over the four years of the Biden administration. And they\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not weaponization. You know that.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: They are \u2013 they are close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons.",
      "Now, that's not the only step to having a weapon. You also have to have the weapon design. We've seen indications that Iran is once again exploring those weapon designs. And then, if you want to use a missile, obviously, you have to marry up the warhead to the missile. But Iran has other delivery methods as well, through terrorist proxies.",
      "So I think that's one of the reasons why both President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu thought we \u2013 things that were coming to a head. A second reason is, Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium-range to target Israel and short-range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month.",
      "And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but why Thursday night?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, as President\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There seems to be a difference in this idea of a sprint.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, as President Trump \u2013 well, as President Trump said on Friday morning, that he had given Iran 60 days to make a deal.",
      "That was day 61.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And he scheduled talks on day 63. You know that.",
      "I mean, this was a \u2013 this wasn't really a hard deadline.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: He gave them 60 days. On day 61, the strikes began.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Day 63, Steve Witkoff wanted to meet with them.",
      "But if this was a covert race to weaponize, though, it \u2013 it raises questions here, because it appears President Trump's offer is to negotiate with the existing regime that is in place in Iran.",
      "Do you support a deal with the existing regime in Iran to stay in place? Do you support his push for diplomacy?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: President Trump has always said his goal is to end Iran's nuclear weapons program\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 which means the surrender of its uranium enrichment capability.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this would be offering them a lifeline, wouldn't it?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, it would be protecting our interests and securing Israel's interests as well in Iran not having a nuclear weapon.",
      "We've seen what happens when they don't have nuclear weapons. They're deliberately targeting civilian areas in Israel. We've seen their campaign of terror against Americans over the decades. That's why we can't allow them to have a nuclear weapon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: And presidents have said \u2013 for 20 years, presidents have said that. George Bush said it, didn't act on it. Barack Obama and Joe Biden, frankly, aided and abetted Iran's nuclear program. Only Donald Trump has drawn that line and is willing to enforce that line.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's not enforcing that line. It is Israel that's bombing. As you just said, the United States is not involved in these offensive operations.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But, in \u2013 in Israel, we are helping \u2013 we're help\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you \u2013 but do you share the president's assessment that the way to finish this is through negotiating with the existing regime that the Israelis have called for the Iranian people to rise up against?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think there's multiple ways to eliminate Iran's enrichment capability. They are today what they were Thursday morning, before these strikes started. As the president has said repeatedly, they can make a deal, or there's going to be bombing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move to some domestic issues, but, very quickly, I know in the past, you have said that former officials who have a direct threat against them from Iran should continue to receive security. President Trump pulled it.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think we should\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should they get it now?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We should probably revisit the threat that all persons face \u2013 remember, President Trump faced assassination threats from Iran as well \u2013 in this moment of tension, to ensure that no one who worked for President Trump in the first term or works for him now could be the target of Iranian agents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that security detail was pulled by the president himself.",
      "On immigration, the Trump administration has decided to pull back its policy a little bit. They are pausing raids on farms, hotels and restaurants. Arkansas has a lot of agricultural business in your state. Do you support this decision?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think we need to have robust worksite enforcement.",
      "I don't think ICE is going to show up at one or two restaurants where they have an illegal migrant working. Usually, it's unscrupulous employers who have large numbers of illegal immigrants working in their worksites. And whatever worksite it is, whatever industry it is, ICE has to be able to go and enforce our immigration laws and remove illegal immigrants.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president has pulled back from that. That was the change in policy last week when it came to farms, in particular.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I don't \u2013 I don't think we should \u2013 I don't think we should pull back to any \u2013 on any kind of enforcement at all.",
      "I think worksite enforcement in all industries needs to be able to move forward. And I think ICE agents on the front lines need the support of political leadership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You would want more enforcement, including in manufacturing, including in construction, where it could impact the economy?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We \u2013 we \u2013 we should \u2013 we should not \u2013 we should not declare any industry or any worksite that uses large numbers of illegal immigrants off-limits for enforcement of federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about the enforcement to date.",
      "As you know, there has been outcry. We've seen protests across the country because of the enforcement policies. You wrote an op-ed supporting President Trump's decision to send in federalized National Guard troops and active-duty Marines to California.",
      "You referred to it as \"the threat from the radical left, an overwhelming show of force to end the riots,\" and talked about communities being terrorized.",
      "Given the amount of tension in the country right now, is that really the language to use?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes, when you see left-wing street militias who are throwing bricks and frozen water bottles at police officers and shooting them with fireworks.",
      "And, unfortunately, you have mayors and governors in some places that won't allow police to maintain order. The next step is to call in the National Guard. And if the governor won't call on the National Guard, then the president has to federalize them.",
      "We always hope that the local police are allowed to do their job and have sufficient numbers to do their job to maintain order and protect innocent life and property. But, if they can't, or they're not allowed to, the National Guard has to be on scene to restore civil order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: LAPD says they were handling when things turned violent yesterday. They fired rubber bullets, but they said they had it under control.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: The L.A. police chief said last weekend that his forces were overwhelmed, and they couldn't manage the situation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cotton, thank you very much for your time today.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute, so stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by two senators in a rare bipartisan interview, Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal. They're co-sponsors on legislation to put secondary sanctions on Russia.",
      "Good morning to you both.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina): Good morning.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-Connecticut): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to that conflict in a moment, but starting here on the Middle East, Senator Graham, you said you believe it's in America's interest to go all in to help Israel finish the job.",
      "It sounds like you mean offensive support.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So, the worst possible outcome for the world is for the Iranian nuclear program to survive after all this. How do you destroy their program? Through diplomacy \u2013 I prefer that \u2013 or through military action.",
      "If diplomacy is not successful, and we are left with the option of force, I would urge President Trump to go all in to make sure that, when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program. If that means providing bombs, provide bombs. If that means flying\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bunker-busting bombs?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Whatever bombs.",
      "If it means flying with Israel, fly with Israel. The worst possible outcome for the world is to take the Iranian nuclear program on and leave it standing. That will be a disaster.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, what's your view? How involved should the U.S. get?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Let's begin with the basic proposition that ought to motivate American policy, as well as the world.",
      "A nuclear-armed Iran is a unacceptable threat to the world, not just to Israel, but to the United States as well. And I support Israel's right to defend itself against this existential menace.",
      "I'm very concerned right now about United States personnel in the region, our service men and women, but also the civilians that are there. I'm getting phone calls from families in Connecticut who are deeply worried about their children who are there, about the hostage families.",
      "I support the president's effort to prioritize diplomacy.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return now to our conversation with Senators Graham and Blumenthal.",
      "Senator Blumenthal, before we get to Ukraine, I just want to tie up the Middle East here.",
      "You know, the defense secretary was testifying to Congress this week, and he said he's moved equipment meant to counter drones in Ukraine over to the Middle East now because of this escalation.",
      "What more is needed to protect U.S. personnel?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We need to move assets. And we've done so. Not only to protect U.S. personnel, but also to enable Israel to defend itself against Iran's retaliation.",
      "But I think that the president is right to try to bring the two sides together. There is a deal that's possible here if Iran were to abandon its effort to build nuclear bombs that endanger not only Israel but the entire regional stability, because all the other Arab nations are going to have nuclear weapons if Iran does as well. But Americans have no interest in a forever war. And so I think we need to be mindful about the priority of diplomacy here and bring the two sides together, as well as protecting U.S. personnel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Senator Graham, the \u2013 the thing with diplomacy is that the Israeli prime minister is calling for the Iranian people to rise up against the regime.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A regime he says is calling for the destruction of his state.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It doesn't really seem like there's a compromise there if it's truly this existential. Is this just leading us towards the outcome you say, which is the United States getting involved in military conflict?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, this \u2013 I would love for the regime to fall. If you don't, if you want this regime to stay in power, you're wanting people to oppress the Iranian people. You want people to threaten their neighbors, to \u2013 to be the largest state \u2013 who wants the largest state sponsor of terrorism to stay in place? But regime change is not the policy of the United States. It is not the purpose of this attack yet. But if there is one attack on an American anywhere in the Mideast by Iran, then you'll get regime change.",
      "So, what are we dealing with? We're dealing with a non-negotiable part of the deal. They can't have a nuclear program that can make a bomb. Diplomacy is preferred, as Dick says, but force may be the only option. And I said as clearly as I can say, if diplomacy fails, Mr. President, President Trump, you've been great, help Israel finish the job. Give them bombs. Fly with them if necessary.",
      "I cannot stress to you how \u2013 if you want to get Russia right, you want to make China be better, you want to convince international terrorism we mean business, you've got to finish the job with Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see if there's any willingness to negotiate. So far, we haven't seen much.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, that's a big mistake on Iran's part. It's not on President Trump's. If we don't have notions, it's not because of Trump, it's because of the ayatollah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or \u2013 you can't necessarily bomb someone into concessions that they were not willing to make, right? I mean here \u2013 is there \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I don't think they have any desire to make concessions.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: If \u2013 if Iran miscalculates now \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: It will face the consequences. But there is a road to a deal. President Obama reached a deal. Far from perfect. President Trump ripped it up. If it were in effect, maybe we could have stopped the Iran nuclear buildup, which has occurred. They're close to ten bombs now. But there is the possibility of diplomacy. In the meantime, the United States ought to provide the means for Israel to defend against this Iranian retaliation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to clarify, when you say close to ten bombs, you mean they would have enough nuclear fuel? But as far as we know, from the U.S. assessment, they hadn't made the political decision to turn that into a weapon. We didn't hear that from the Senate Intel chair when I asked that.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: What purpose do you need \u2013 if I may, what purpose is there for enriched uranium at 60 percent other than making a weapon?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Leverage (ph).",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Why do you have 900 pounds of this stuff if you don't want to make a weapon?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, the \u2013 the assessment was they wanted the leverage, right? So \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, right, whatever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the bipartisan work you are both doing, if I can.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yay.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: By the way \u2013",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Finally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran and \u2013 Iran and Russia \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. And we're bipartisan on this. We say the same, actually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And \u2013 you are. Iran and Russia work together.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: And, you know, if I can just add one more point about Iran \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Because we're going to talk about Russian sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think we ought to strengthen sanctions against Iran, which is a non-kinetic, a peaceful means of exerting pressure. I'm hoping that perhaps Senator Graham and I \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I will be your wingman. We'll write the bill right here on television. China, if you're listening, stop buying Russian oil and stop helping the Iranians. You would make the world a safer place if you would stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They buy it because it's cheap, though. And they \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, they \u2013 well, you know \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that \u2013 but right now \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well then, they should play a price for propping up Putin's war machine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sure.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We should crush their economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So, tell me about that. So, with the \u2013 the sanctions bill that you all are working on, you have a veto-proof majority.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just need the Senate leader to put it to a floor and you need the president to tell him go. What are you waiting for?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think the president should call on the Senate to vote approval of the Russian sanction bill literally tomorrow. He's on his way tonight to the G-7 meeting. He will be sitting across from world leaders. Right now, very bluntly, the perception may be one of weakness in terms of America's position on Ukraine. He can be there in a position of strength. This bill will pass overwhelmingly. It has 84 evenly divided co- sponsored. It will get 90 votes on the floor of the Senate.",
      "This moment cries out for presidential leadership. There is an urgency here. We've seen the neighborhoods decimated, people killed in their sleep, women and children shot in the back of their heads and buried in mass graves in Bukha. Children who are kidnapped and re-educated, 20,000 of them, behind Russian lines. These atrocities are ongoing. And the people of Ukraine are bleeding and dying.",
      "So, I am hoping that the president will affirmatively show leadership here and call on the Senate to vote. The majority leader could do it tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We have some technical issues to work out. But I really think the moment has come for President Trump to call on the Senate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, President Trump tweeted yesterday that he did speak to Vladimir Putin, who called very nicely to wish me a happy birthday and talk about Iran.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said they're going to speak again this week.",
      "President Trump has put sanctions on Iran while talking to Iran. Why won't he put sanctions on Russia while talking to Russia?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We have sanctions on Russia. He \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not new Trump sanctions. You know that.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Just \u2013 so, I find it odd. So, my Democratic friends are holding him back when it comes to Iran. We appreciate you trying to do diplomacy. What am I saying? Do diplomacy with Iran until it doesn't work. What am I saying with Russia? I don't mind you \u2013 I don't care if you go on vacation with Putin. I don't care how it ends. I want the war to end so we don't start new wars. I want our \u2013 Ukraine surviving when the war ends. I want Putin not to be overly rewarded for the invasion.",
      "To China, if you stop buying Russian oil, cheap, and India, the war machine would grind to a halt. President Trump has tried diplomacy. And I will say this, I talked to him last night, you've made very sincere efforts to get Putin to the table. I think he's playing a game with you and the entire world. It is now time to change the game with Putin.",
      "I talked to President Trump last night. Stay tuned. If we do not have a breakthrough soon, I would expect that these sanctions will move through the Senate and the House. And to China, if you want your economy ruined, keep buying Russian cheap oil. If you want to be a new nation in the eyes of the civilized world, change your behavior regarding Putin and the ayatollah. And until you change your behavior \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You're going to be seen as a problem, not a solution.",
      "So, these sanctions are coming if Putin doesn't change. And to my good friend Dick, you've been a great ally. If we can't get the ayatollah back to the table, it is now time to end his nuclear program using military force, jointly with Israel if we have to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: If we get Iran wrong, good luck with Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, the bill that you put forward will put a 500 percent tariff, as I understand it, on imported goods from countries that buy Russia's oil, their uranium, their gas, other products. It would hit China. It would hit India. The U.S. is also trying to negotiate trade deals with them. Is that getting in the way?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think there is really no obstacle to our moving ahead with these bone-crushing sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if oil prices spike because of what's happening in the Middle East?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: You know, we are now energy independent when it comes to oil, the United States. Europe has weaned itself off Russian oil. We visited with President Macron, we've talked to Chancellor Merz. Europe is solidly behind these sanctions. And we've incorporated flexibility in this bill based on our national security for a potential waiver where our interests are concerned, unforeseeable or unknowably right now. We've incorporated exceptions for our European allies who are aiding Ukraine in the billions of dollars, giving them a little bit more time to adjust.",
      "This is a carefully constructed bill.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They get 20 percent of their gas from Russia, right?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Can \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: What he says, that there's three categories. If you're not doing business with Russia, you don't have anything to worry about. If you're doing business with Russia but you're helping Ukraine, you have a carveout for 270 days. If you're doing business with Russia and not helping Ukraine, you're screwed. The president can waive part or all of this based on our national interest. But to the people who wonder, should we pay a price for our freedom? We have in the past.",
      "Go to Arlington. Oil prices will go up if we confront Russia through our bill. Oil prices will go up if we try to confront Iran for their nuclear ambitions. But you pay now or you pay later.",
      "If we get Iran right and we get peace with Russia/Ukraine, not only do oil prices come down, the world will be better off. So, this idea of having freedom and not sacrificing never existed, nor does it exist now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I want to ask you as well about what's happening here at home with the protests we have seen around the country and some of them at times turning violent. There has been criticism of Democrats' policies on immigration. Do you think that this confrontation that we are seeing now, between military forces, federalized, and protesters is partly because of what Democrats have done to date?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: The use of military, whether it's the National Guard or the Marines, can be inflammatory and provocative. We had protests across the country yesterday that were entirely peaceful. I was at a number of them in Connecticut, in Hartford and Farmington and elsewhere, all around the country. I think this country knows how to do peaceful protest. And the exceptions ought to be handled by the local police and prosecutors locally.",
      "I spent most of my life in law enforcement before I had this job. I was the chief federal prosecutor in Connecticut. Then I was attorney general for 20 years. And the reliance on state and local police I think is well-founded. And I've supported \u2013 in fact, I've introduced a bill that would limit use of the Insurrection Act, would define better what is a rebellion, and compel the president to come back to Congress for approval if he uses this kind of federal force.",
      "So, I think that there are criticisms to be made of immigration policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: In fact, I favor comprehensive immigration reform. We need it. But that is separate \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would call on local law enforcement to perhaps stand up more and deal with it at the local level?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: It's the local level where law enforcement happens in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We rely on state and local police. And that ought to be the way we enforce our laws in this country. And emphasize the importance of peaceful protests, such as we saw yesterday around the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "All right, Senators, thank you for joining us for a bipartisan interview. Rare, as we said.",
      "We'll be back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Saturday, demonstrators participating in the \"no kings\" movement marched in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., as part of an organized effort to protest President Trump's policies, including recent deportation sweeps. Organizers of the \"no kings\" rally said that over 5 million people participated coast to coast.",
      "Most were peaceful. But in Salt Lake City, at least one person was injured in a shooting during a demonstration. And in Portland, Oregon, local police declared a riot outside an I.C.E. facility for a few hours before that crowd dispersed.",
      "And we're joined now by California Senator Alex Padilla.",
      "Good morning and Happy Father's Day to you.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA (D-California): Thank you. Thank you. Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there and including those who are living a little bit fearful right now because of what we're seeing, these increasingly cruel and extreme immigration enforcement raids. But, nonetheless, they're going to work, trying to provide for their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about your personal experience with some of this. As many of our viewers saw that video of you being briefly detained when you were trying to get a question to the Homeland Security secretary. Their office \u2013 her office later said you spoke for nearly 15 minutes afterwards. Did you get the answer to the question you were trying to ask? And \u2013 and what was it?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, sadly, no. And to a little bit of context here. The reason I tried to \u2013 the reason I was at the press conference, I was \u2013 I was at a scheduled briefing with representatives at Northern Command, just a couple doors down the hall, in the same federal building, when I learned of the press conference. My briefing delayed because the folks I was supposed to meet with were at that press conference.",
      "So, I asked if we could listen in. I was escorted over. And that's what I was doing.",
      "Why? Because for months and months, whether it's in committee, the secretary herself testifying and not providing substantive answers to questions, other representatives of the department, formal letters and inquiries that we've submitted, doing my job as a senator, to get information as part of our oversight and accountability responsibility.",
      "So, to be able to ask a question of the secretary directly, when they offered the meeting after the incident, I took it but, sadly, no, nothing substantive, nothing informative.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She couldn't answer the question or \u2013",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Either couldn't or wouldn't. And \u2013 and, frankly, that says a lot, right, in terms of the type of \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What was the question?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well, among other things, their justification for the \u2013 the federalization of the National Guard, not only not necessary but counterproductive as we've seen this last week in Los Angeles. And also just truth. You know, for all the talk about the focus and targeting of violent criminals, if that's all the Trump administration was doing, there would be no debate. There's no disagreement on that.",
      "But as you're hearing more and more stories of undocumented, long-term residents of the United States who are otherwise law-abiding, working hard, paying taxes, raising families. And, frankly, working in jobs that under the first Trump administration, when the Covid pandemic hit, were deemed essential, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Workers in restaurants, in agricultural fields, in health care, construction, et cetera, that's who's being targeted now, and that's why there's so much fear and \u2013 and terror in communities, not just in Los Angeles but throughout the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the vast majority of immigrants in California, we went and we looked at the stats. They are in this country legally. But Pew Research says your state has nearly two million undocumented and they make up about 7 percent of the entire labor force in some of those farming and service jobs that you \u2013 you talked about.",
      "Since the Trump administration this week told I.C.E. to pull back a bit when it comes to enforcement, do you see that as a step in the right direction, and do you know what triggered that decision?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, so I don't know exactly what triggered that decision. I'll take it. Is it a step in the right direction? It's at least a baby step. And let's hope there's more to follow because they're responding to what I and others have been saying for months and what's frankly years, going back to the first Trump administration. You know, you \u2013 you \u2013 you want stats? Let's talk about stats. The \u2013 the state of California, the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation, mostly documented, some undocumented. This is the same California that is the largest economy of any state in the nation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Fourth-largest economy in the world. Not despite the immigrant population, but thanks to the contributions of so many immigrants as a workforce, as consumers and as \u2013 as entrepreneurs. So, again, focus on the dangerous, violent criminals. No disagreement there. But the \u2013 the folks who are otherwise law-abiding, tax-paying and \u2013 and enriching communities, there's got to be a better way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: A pathway towards legalization. A pathway to citizenship for dreamers, farm workers and others.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 that's \u2013 that is hoping for \u2013 for movement in Congress that would take some time.",
      "I did note it was interesting to see the \u2013 in the House, the Republican Hispanic conference put forth a letter asking for a breakdown of how many criminals were among those actually deported.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: And that was \u2013 yes, that was \u2013 and that was one of the key questions I had for the secretary. Of course, she had no data, had no answer, promised to follow up, I hope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: We'll see. And \u2013 and I also want to be clear about this, because when I had the audacity to try to ask a question, as a Senator of a cabinet secretary, that's what happened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: And you saw the response. Everybody's seen the video. You know, it wasn't about me. But if that's how this administration responds to a senator with a question, don't just imagine what they're capable of but what they are doing when the cameras are not there to people without a title like United States senator. That cruel, disrespectful treatment of so many people who deserve much better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see in our polling \u2013 on the policy front, we see in our polling that there still is broad support for President Trump's mass deportation policy. Our last CBS poll, as of last Sunday, showed 54 percent approval. There was an interesting \"Washington Post\" piece written by David Ignatius that was pretty sharp about Democrats, saying that, \"they've gotten the border issue so wrong for so long, it's political malpractice.\" And that he was basically arguing, Democrats are handing to Trump the confrontation he wanted with the military, citing actions during the first administration.",
      "Do you think that he has a point there?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: No, I think, you know, \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the public approval is so high of deportation.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well \u2013 but details matter. It depends. You know, it depends on how you ask the question. If you ask the same people, you know, do they think we should maintain due process in the United States of America, the answer is overwhelming, yes. Do dreamers deserve better than the limbo that they find themselves in? Overwhelmingly, on a bipartisan basis, yes.",
      "And so, I think it's important to break down three things. Number one, do we need a safe and secure, ordinarily, humane border? Absolutely. No disagreement there. People seeking to come to the United States, whether it's to seek asylum, on work visas, et cetera, we definitely have to modernize that system and be more strategic in those capacities. But we can't forget the millions of long-term residents, people who have been here working, paying taxes, raising families, buying homes, contributing to the strength of our economy, they deserve better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are the ranking member on the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees the Capitol Police. What, if anything, can you tell us about the state of security for lawmakers given what's happening in Minnesota?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, look, a lot of questions, a lot of concerns. I work directly with both the U.S. Capitol Police and the Senate Sergeant at Arms. And they're doing what they need to do to ensure the \u2013 the safety of members of \u2013 of Congress. But I also think it's more than appropriate to step back and say, why are tensions so high, not just in Los Angeles, but throughout the country? And I can't help but point to the beginning of, not just the first Trump term, but the \u2013 the beginning of the campaign. The tone with which the president launched his first campaign for president, served throughout his first term and continues in this term. For a cabinet secretary, during a press conference, to not be able or be willing to deescalate a situation when I was trying to ask a question, that's just indicative of the tone of the administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You wanted her to say, wait a second, I \u2013 I know who he is, calm down, let him go? Is that what you're saying?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: The \u2013 the vast majority of people in that room knew who I was. I was escorted into that room by an FBI agent and a National Guard's member. It's the Los Angeles Press Corp. It said, United States Senate on the chest of my polo.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Padilla, thank you for joining us today.",

      "On China-based Temu.com, a seller shipping goods from a U.S.-based warehouse offers a T-shirt reading \"No Kings in America\" and featuring the Statue of Liberty and American flag for $5.20. On Amazon, a search for \"No Kings\" yielded 1,000 results.",
      "Much of the merchandise available on the e-commerce giant's site is printed on demand, meaning not in stock. Sellers print T-shirts or make the goods as soon as they are ordered to avoid sitting on unwanted inventory.",

    "story": [
      "The Air India plane crash on Thursday is putting a renewed spotlight on Boeing, the manufacturer of the 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft that crashed in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad with 242 passengers and crew on board.",
      "Boeing says the 787-8 is the aviation industry's \"best-selling passenger widebody of all time,\" carrying more than 1 billion passengers since it was first delivered to airlines in 2011.",
      "What caused the crash remains unclear, and the 787-8 Dreamliner has generally had a good safety record. U.S. safety officials said they are heading to India to assist in the investigation of the accident. A senior Indian police official told the country's national news agency, ANI, that one\u00a0person survived the crash.",
      "\"The NTSB will be leading a team of U.S. investigators travelling to India to assist the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau with its investigation into the crash of an Air India Boeing 787 in Ahmedabad, India, Thursday,\" the National Transportation Safety Board said in a social media post.",
      "In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said the local government leads an investigation when it occurs in that country. \"In the event assistance is requested, the NTSB is the official U.S. representative and the FAA provides technical support. We stand ready to launch a team immediately in coordination with the NTSB,\" the agency said.",
      "Boeing said it is in contact with Air India about the crash and stands \"ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected.\"",

      "Last year, a whistleblower's allegations prompted the FAA to investigate his claims about assembly defects in the company's 787 Dreamliner.",
      "Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer, said \"he observed shortcuts taken by Boeing\" during assembly of the Dreamliner, \"resulting in drilling debris left in interfaces and deformation of composite material,\" CBS News reported. He also claimed to have witnessed issues with the 777 assembly process, according to a letter sent by Salehpour's lawyers to the FAA last year.",
      "For now, it is unclear if those reported issues are linked in any way to the Air India crash.",
      "The Dreamliner in the Air India crash",
      "The aircraft involved in the Air India crash was first delivered to the airline in January 2014. It was on its way from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad to London's Gatwick airport when it crashed shortly after its departure.",
      "The plane had logged more than 41,000 hours of flying time, with almost 8,000 takeoffs and landings, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Air India operates 190 aircraft, with an average age of 8.4 years, Cirium said.",
      "There are more than 1,100 Dreamliners operating across the globe today, with the aircraft having been in operation for an average of 7.5 years, Cirium noted.",
      "Air India said there was a \"sole survivor\" of the crash who was being treated at a hospital.",
      "\"The aircraft crashed shortly after take-off. We regret to inform that, of the 242 aboard, there are 241 confirmed fatalities. The sole survivor is being treated in a hospital,\" the airline\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement Thursday on social media.",
      "Other Boeing safety issues",
      "The incident comes after a string of safety issues for Boeing, which has faced investigations and lawsuits for two crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners that killed a total of 346 people. A January incident in which a door plug fell off a 737 Max 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines in January of 2024 fueled further concerns.",
      "Boeing posted a 2024 loss of $11.8 billion, bringing its total losses since 2019 to more than $35 billion.",
      "In May, the aircraft manufacturer\u00a0reached a $1.1 billion deal\u00a0with the Department of Justice that allows it to avoid prosecution for the crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019.",
      "An April 2025 analysis of commercial jet safety from Boeing shows that the airline industry has improved its overall safety record over the past several decades, although there was an increase in accidents in 2024. According to the report, there were 47 accidents last year across the airline industry, including 12 hull losses, and 187 fatalities.",

      "\"Across the country we have seen instances of rioting, looting, arson, destruction of property, assaults on officers (federal, state, and local), and obstruction of federal immigration enforcement efforts,\" the memo said. \"[T]he Department has zero tolerance for any such criminal behavior.\"",
      "The memo instructs U.S. Attorneys' Offices to \"diligently monitor these enforcement efforts by maintaining regular comms with their DHS and DOJ agency counterparts.\"",
      "The memo added that leadership \"should prepare their offices to provide legal support for operations in their districts. One or two duty [assistant U.S. attorneys] is insufficient. All [U.S. Attorney Office] leadership and the entire Criminal Division should be on standby. There should be no bottleneck of referrals for complaints and legal process.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors were instructed to \"prioritize\" any requests for search warrants or complaints in these types of cases and \"push out press releases whenever you file charges in these matters.\"",
      "The Justice Department has already filed a series of criminal cases that allege obstruction or criminal activity related to immigration operations, and has vowed to prosecute anyone who assaults officers or interferes with ongoing immigration actions amid protests in Los Angeles and around the country.",
      "David Huerta, a longtime union leader, is charged in Los Angeles with conspiracy. He is scheduled for arraignment on July 7. According to a Homeland Security Investigation officer's sworn affidavit, Huerta sat down in front of a vehicular gate to a staging ground for Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations that were ongoing nearby. The complaint alleged he yelled to other protesters to \"stop the vehicles,\" and said, \"It's a public sidewalk, they can't stop us.\"",
      "In a separate case, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey has filed a felony criminal case against Rep. LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat, who was attempting to visit an immigration facility in Newark on May 9. Prosecutors alleged McIver sought to stop federal agents from arresting the mayor of Newark during the confrontation. \"During her continued attempts to thwart the arrest, McIver slammed her forearm into the body of one law enforcement officer and also reached out and tried to restrain that officer by forcibly grabbing him,\" the Justice Department said. \"McIver also used each of her forearms to forcibly strike a second officer.\"",
      "McIver responded to the criminal indictment in a statement: \"The facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation.\"",
      "When asked for comment about the new memo to prosecutors, a Justice Department spokesman told CBS News, \"As we've said repeatedly, the Department respects the right to peacefully protest & assemble to engage on important issues. However, the Department and its 94 US Attorney Offices will not tolerate unlawful violence & destruction of property. We are prepared to respond accordingly.\"",

    "summary": "Children's deaths by gun-related homicide and suicide rose in states that had the most permissive firearm laws following a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision, a new study found.",
    "story": [
      "Gun deaths among children have risen over a 13-year period in states with lax firearm laws, according to a new study published this week in JAMA Pediatrics, a peer-reviewed medical journal.",
      "Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho and Georgia were among the states that saw a jump in pediatric gun deaths after amending their firearms restrictions following a 2010\u00a0U.S. Supreme Court\u00a0ruling that applied the Second Amendment to the states, researchers found.",
      "Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency room doctor at Massachusetts General Brigham Hospital and the study's lead author, said he started the research after wondering why gun deaths among children were so high. Firearms are the leading cause of death among children and teenagers in the United States, with a\u00a0steep increase\u00a0in ages 15 to 19 starting in 2020.",
      "\"Why did things go so badly in some states?\" Faust asked. He said legal scholars told him to look at\u00a0McDonald v. City of Chicago, which applied the Second Amendment to local jurisdictions.",
      "The Supreme Court held in the landmark case that the Constitution's Second Amendment restrains the government's ability to significantly limit \"the right to keep and bear arms.\" For the first decade of the 21st century, there were very few changes to gun laws but every state changed their laws to some or great extent after McDonald, said Faust.",
      "Researchers divided the 50 states into three groups \u2014 most permissive, permissive, and strict \u2014 based on legal changes made since 2010. The team, which included researchers from Brown University, Yale New Haven, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of California, used a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database to analyze data from the decade before the Supreme Court ruling and then compared that to data from 2011 to 2023.",
      "The findings surprised Faust and his team, he told CBS News.",
      "Youth deaths jumped by 7,398 in the period after the Supreme Court ruling \u2014 with a total of 23,000 gun-related fatalities. Children's deaths by both homicide and suicide also rose in states that had the most permissive firearm laws, the study found. Black youth also saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the most permissive and permissive states.",
      "The CDC found in 2023 that the vast majority of firearm deaths involving young children were\u00a0due to guns\u00a0that were stored unlocked and loaded. But Faust said that while gun storage is an important part of saving lives, the study shows strict laws play an enormous role in preventing youth firearms deaths.",
      "In the states that had the most restrictive laws, deaths remained stable or, in some cases, there were fewer pediatric gun deaths.",
      "California had a 40% reduction in children's gun deaths, the study found. New York, Rhode Island, Maryland and Massachusetts also saw a decrease.",
      "\"This study shows the problem is linked pretty tightly to legal posture. This can be fixed and bring back thousands of people,\" Faust said.\u00a0\"States should ask what they want for their communities? What are they willing to do to save lives?\"",
      "Gun-control advocates like Emma Brown, the executive director of Giffords \u2014 an anti-gun violence group led by former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords who was shot in the head in 2011 during a constituent meeting \u2014 applauded the study's findings.",
      "\"Guns are the leading cause of death for kids and young people in the United States, and now more kids are dying because some states prioritize making gun CEOs richer over fighting crime and building safe communities,\" Brown said. \"This study shows what we all know: common sense gun laws save lives.\"",

      "Much like a golf course, Venmo can bring some unexpected traps and other hazards.",
      "The popular payment app enables users to send requests and payments to Venmo accounts listed as public \u2014 a default setting that opened up a can of worms for the world's top golfer, Scottie Scheffler.",
      "Scheffler, 28, who is competing in the U.S. Open this week, said Tuesday that he deleted the app after receiving a string of unwanted financial requests and payments from strangers betting on his performance.",
      "\"That's why I had to get rid of my Venmo because I was either getting paid by people or people requesting me a bunch of money when I didn't win. It wasn't a good feeling,\" the 16-time PGA Tour winner recently told reporters, according to CBS Sports.",
      "While he occasionally received small payments after winning a game, Scheffler said he more typically got requests from gamblers looking to cash in if he had lost.",
      "\"I don't remember the most that somebody would send me,\" he said. \"Maybe a couple bucks here or there. That didn't happen nearly as much as the requests did.\"",
      "Ordinary Venmo users may not attract the same attention on the app as Scheffler, but they can still benefit from knowing how to protect their privacy on the payment platform.",
      "Read on for tips on how to navigate Venmo safely.",
      "What should I do if I get an unexpected payment or request on Venmo?",
      "With the proliferation on online scams, Venmo encourages its users to play it safe. If you get a payment from a stranger, Venmo says you should not accept the transfer, but instead contact the app's\u00a0support team.",
      "Likewise, payment requests from suspicious accounts, or people you don't know, should also be declined, the company says.",
      "\"In some cases, you may receive a payment request from someone who appears to be a friend or relative,\" Venmo warns on its website. \"This can be a common scam tactic, so we recommend contacting your friend or family member outside of Venmo to confirm the legitimacy of the request before taking any action.\"",
      "For more information on how to safely use Venmo, the company's\u00a0website\u00a0outlines common mobile payment scams and how to avoid them.",
      "Can everyone see my Venmo payment history?",
      "Paying your roommate for the electricity bill? Others might be able to see that transaction on Venmo, depending on your account settings.",
      "If your profile is public, which is the default setting on the app, then each of your payment transactions will appear on Venmo's main feed, making them visible to anyone online. That includes information on who you're paying, when you paid them and what you're paying them for \u2014 cue the pizza emoji.",
      "To limit the number of people who can see your transactions, you can switch your privacy settings to \"Friends only\" or \"Private.\" The \"Friends only\" setting makes your payment transactions visible to Venmo friends only. The \"Private\" setting, the most restrictive of the three options, limits payment visibility to the two parties engaged in the transaction. Venmo also allows you to retroactively change your transactions to private mode which would hide your entire payment history, according to a company spokesperson.",
      "If you're paying or requesting money from someone who has different privacy setting than you, Venmo will default to whoever's setting is more restrictive.",
      "For example, if your account is private and you're making a payment to someone with a public account, the payment will automatically be private, and only visible to you and the recipient.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-dept-rubber-room-lawyers-do-jigsaw-puzzles-stream-shows/",
    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 10:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Nearly a dozen of the government's most seasoned lawyers have been relegated to what they refer to as the Justice Dept. rubber room.",
    "story": [
      "When the Trump administration swept into the Department of Justice on Jan. 20, it moved swiftly to purge, demote, transfer and otherwise sideline career lawyers not perceived to be team players or sufficiently committed to the MAGA legal agenda.",
      "Amid the upheaval and exodus of longtime federal prosecutors, one quiet 10th floor office in a remote outpost of the Justice Department has come to symbolize the withering impact of changes at the agency. Those who work there call it \"the rubber room.\"",
      "Inside, nearly a dozen of the government's most seasoned civil rights, environmental and national security lawyers have been reconstituted as members of a newly created group called the Sanctuary Cities task force.",
      "At first glance, the job seemed promising \u2014 a legal strike team that would sue municipalities the administration claimed were facilitating the violation of immigration laws, a task force undertaking a top priority for the new Justice Department leadership.",
      "But the more these attorneys looked into it, the more they concluded the task force was a sham, a Potemkin operation that seemed more aimed at stashing away career lawyers than putting them to work on a legitimate legal project, according to interviews with six people knowledgeable about the task force, all of whom painted a similar picture.",
      "Lawyers there have been assigned menial research tasks and left with hours of idle time \u2014 an effort they view as intended to coerce them into resigning, those with knowledge of the task force said.",
      "\"This is a hard thing to talk about,\" said Tom Mariani, an environmental litigator who resigned rather than accept reassignment to the rubber room. \"I can't tell you how much personal distress I feel over how these folks were treated.\"",
      "The term rubber room is an allusion to now-infamous \"reassignment centers\" where New York City officials transferred public school teachers and administrators who some considered burned out or incompetent, but who could not be fired because of union rules. But in this case, those being transferred have been elite veteran attorneys from the Civil Rights Division, the National Security Division and the Environment and Natural Resources Division whose performance had not previously been questioned.",
      "For months they did little or no work, were cut off from other Justice Department litigators who were actually working on sanctuary city cases and had no supervisors they could turn to for support, those familiar with the assignment told CBS News. At least four of those assigned to the task force have filed formal complaints with the Justice Department's inspector general alleging waste, fraud and abuse, CBS News has learned.",
      "That office declined comment on whether there is an active investigation into the treatment of the task force lawyers.",
      "None would comment for this story, fearing retaliation from the administration. But public interest lawyers and government watchdogs say their experience stands apart as an example of how callously civil servants who have dedicated their professional lives to public service have been treated.",
      "\"For the first time in modern U.S. history, we are witnessing purely vindictive and retaliatory actions being taken against non-partisan civil servants who simply performed their jobs consistent with law and policy during prior time,\" said Mark Zaid, a Washington lawyer who represents government whistleblowers.",
      "A new president, a new assignment: The Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group",
      "The emails began arriving in the third week of January from then-Acting Attorney General James McHenry, landing in the inboxes of some of the Justice Department's most senior career attorneys, notifying them that they were being transferred to the newly created Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group and had 15 days to decide whether to take the new assignment or resign.",
      "Among those told they were being transferred to the task force were the two most senior career lawyers in the National Security Division, George Toscas and Eun Young Choi. Toscas, who was one of the most knowledgeable counterterrorism lawyers in the federal government, took personal leave instead of showing up at the task force offices. Choi, a highly experienced cyber and crypto prosecutor, also took personal leave. Both have since left the department.",
      "Mariani, who was the chief of the enforcement section of the Environment and Natural Resources section, was a 40-year veteran of the Justice Department who had reached retirement age. He said he opted to exit rather than take the new assignment.",
      "Those who did accept the assignment arrived in the isolated offices during what some called a Department of Justice in turmoil, former senior prosecutors told CBS News.",
      "Puzzles and streaming shows",
      "In this environment, several people familiar with the matter told CBS News that lawyers assigned to the new sanctuary cities section felt they had few options. They showed up for their first day \u2014 Feb. 12 \u2014 at a satellite building of the Justice Department known informally as 2Con for its address at 2 Constitution Avenue. Their handler was Kendra Wharton, an associate deputy attorney general who had worked on multiple legal cases involving President Trump before joining the department.",
      "Wharton rarely, if ever, showed up at the 10th floor office at 2Con. Some lawyers said they never saw her at the rubber room in the nearly three months they were on the task force.",
      "In the first few weeks, she communicated with the group on video calls to give them their assignments. On Feb. 13, at 9:30 a.m., Wharton called in from Justice Department headquarters while the attorneys gathered around a monitor. According to a source familiar with the call, she asked them to research the sanctuary city policies in several heavily Democratic states. The lawyers asked if they could contact the Civil Division lawyers handling the litigation in those states, but Wharton told them she was to be the single point of contact.",
      "\"A 10th grader could have done it,\" one source familiar with the work remarked bitterly.",
      "Two weeks later, Wharton asked the lawyers to compile information on three additional states. On March 5, Wharton asked for \"emergency\" follow up on a single city, according to one source. A few days later she added one more blue state to the places she wanted studied.",
      "After that, Wharton received a different mandate, and she is no longer supervising the lawyers, a Justice Department official said. Work in the rubber room slowed to a halt.",
      "\"Having worked around the clock for years, if not decades, the imposed idleness was something I could not get used to,\" said one lawyer who was assigned to the task force.",
      "The lawyers continued coming into 2Con each morning but had to find activities to occupy their time. Some completed jigsaw puzzles and streamed television shows like \"The Last of Us\" and \"Succession.\" One lawyer, Deborah Harris, whose previous job had been head of the Environment and Natural Resources Division's crimes section, could be seen practicing Italian on Duolingo.",
      "Reached for comment, Harris confirmed some details about some of the ways she passed her time in the rubber room but declined to say anything more.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said, \"The Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group is focused on important work to advance top priorities of this administration.\"",
      "Turmoil inside the Justice Department",
      "The rubber room is just the latest in a series of personnel moves that critics of the administration have tracked. Some have been demoted within their own units. Bruce Swartz, the highly respected head of the Office of International Affairs, was notified by email that he was being transferred to the office's training program, a job that fell several rungs below his position. He opted to resign.",
      "Nearly a dozen prosecutors in the Public Integrity Section and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York quit rather than sign onto legal actions they objected to \u2014 such as the decision in February to drop the prosecution of New York Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "And at the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office, the interim top prosecutor fired or demoted dozens of assistant U.S. attorneys who had won convictions against hundreds of rioters who assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Those who did not resign were given jobs typically assigned to junior prosecutors, sometimes referred to as \"baby AUSAs,\" like handling misdemeanors in D.C. Superior Court or working in the office's intake section screening cases for prosecution or alternative action.",
      "Harold Koh, Sterling professor of international law and a former dean of Yale Law School, served in the Justice and State Departments under four presidents from both parties. For him, the rooting out of so many lawyers represents more than the personal devastation of these government professionals \u2014 it would be a loss for the American people for years to come.",
      "\"Apart from the shabby, petty treatment of career government officials and the degradation of government institutions, the greatest injury to the American people is the harm caused by the destruction of preparedness for dealing with the next crisis,\" Koh said of this administration.",
      "\"The best and the brightest have always wanted to go to Justice,\" he added, \"but who would want to go to a place like that now?\"",
      "Daniel Klaidman, an investigative reporter based in New York, is the former editor-in-chief of Yahoo News and former managing editor of Newsweek. He has over two decades of experience covering politics, foreign affairs, national security and law."

      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has made the destruction of Iran's nuclear program his top priority, brushed off urgent calls from world leaders to de-escalate, saying Israel's strikes so far are \"nothing compared to what they will feel under the sway of our forces in the coming days.\"",

      "\"The individuals who were eliminated played a central part of the progress toward nuclear weapons,\" the IDF said in a news release. \"Their elimination represents a significant blow to the Iranian regime's ability to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\"",

The Israeli military urged civilians, already rattled by 20 months of war in Gaza sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, to head to shelter for hours. U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News that U.S. forces helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles on Friday.",
      "Iran calls nuclear talks \"unjustifiable\"",

      "A senior administration official told CBS News, \"While there will be no meeting Sunday, we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon.\"",
      "Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, said Saturday that the nuclear talks were \"unjustifiable\" after Israel's strikes, which he said were the \"result of the direct support by Washington.\"",

      "In a post on his Truth Social account early Sunday, Mr. Trump reiterated that the U.S. was not involved in the attacks on Iran and warned that any retaliation directed against it would bring an American response \"at levels never seen before.\"",

      "\"Likewise, we will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran!\" he wrote. \"Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that's OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "One of Mr. Trump's allies in the senate, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday morning that Mr. Trump \"sent a clear message to the Ayatollahs, that if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the U.S. military in a way no one's ever seen.\"",
      "Above-ground section of Natanz facility destroyed",
      "Among the key sites Israel attacked was Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, where black smoke could be seen rising into the air. It also appeared to strike a second, smaller nuclear enrichment facility in Fordo, about 60 miles southeast of Tehran, according to an Iranian news outlet close to the government that reported hearing explosions nearby.",
      "Israel said it also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan, and said it destroyed dozens of radar installations and surface-to-air missile launchers in western Iran. Iran confirmed the strike at Isfahan.",
      "U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told the Security Council that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground did not appear to have been hit, but the loss of power could have damaged the infrastructure there, he said.",
      "Israel also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The International Atomic Energy Agency said four \"critical buildings\" were damaged, including its uranium conversion facility. It said there was no sign of increased radiation at Natanz or Isfahan.",
      "An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with official procedures, said that according to the army's initial assessment, \"it will take much more than a few weeks\" for Iran to repair the damage to the Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites. The official said the army had \"concrete intelligence that production in Isfahan was for military purposes.\"",
      "On \"Face the Nation,\" Cotton said Iran is \"close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons,\" and that's why both Mr. Trump and Netanyahu thought \"things were coming to a head\" with Thursday night's launch.",
      "\"A second reason is Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium range to target Israel, and short range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month,\" Cotton added. \"And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.\"",

      "In the first round, about 100 missiles were fired from Iran in two salvos, officials said. Israel has a robust missile defense system known as the\u00a0Iron Dome, which intercepted most of the missiles, the IDF said. The IDF reported a limited number of hits on structures, some from interception failures.",
      "Video and photos show a number of buildings damaged or on fire. The IDF reported that 21 people had been injured and two were in serious condition.",
      "Dozens more missiles came in the next wave, and again the IDF said some, but not all, were intercepted. \"Search and Rescue forces are currently operating in a number of locations across the country in which reports of fallen projectiles were received,\" the military said.",
      "A U.S. official and a White House official confirmed to CBS News that the United States helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles.",
      "During the strikes, U.S. troops at two bases in the Middle East were ordered into bunkers. Troops at Union III in the Green Zone in Baghdad, Iraq, and Al-Tanf Garrison in Syria spent about an hour in the bunkers, CBS News confirmed.",
      "The retaliatory action from Iran came after Israel launched over 200 airstrikes on Iran, continuing a\u00a0major operation\u00a0that began overnight, IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said Friday. Israel's airstrikes are continuing, Defrin said.",
      "Iran's U.N. ambassador said Friday that 78 people were killed and more than 320 were injured in Israeli attacks.",
      "Israel first launched airstrikes on Iran early Friday and announced its operation was targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists and senior military commanders.",
      "Tehran responded by launching more than 100 drones at Israel on Friday morning, Israel's military said. Defrin said earlier Friday that Israel's air defenses had worked to \"intercept the threats.\" Later Friday, an Israeli military official told reporters that while the threat wasn't over, Israel had managed to intercept many of Iran's UAVs.",
      "\"Throughout the day, we once again demonstrated our ability to remove threats in a coordinated, precise and daring manner,\" Defrin said Friday night local time.",
      "In a televised statement on Friday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the Iranian Armed Forces would respond fiercely to the strikes and leave Israel \"helpless.\"",
      "Shortly after the statement, the IDF confirmed that its fighter jets had \"completed a strike on the Iranian regime's nuclear site in the Isfahan area.\" Ishafan is in central Iran. The strike \"dismantled a facility for producing metallic uranium, infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium, laboratories and additional infrastructure,\" the IDF said.",
      "U.S. not involved in Israel's strikes, Rubio says",
      "The U.S. was not involved in Israel's strikes, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, adding a warning that \"Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.\"",
      "The State Department informed multiple U.S.-allied governments in the region Thursday in advance of the Israeli strikes and intelligence operations in Iran, four sources told CBS News. Rubio personally reached out to a number of them, sources said.",
      "The main message conveyed by the Trump administration in those messages was that this was not a U.S. operation and did not involve U.S. assets, and that the U.S. preferred diplomacy to military force.",
      "President Trump said in a post Friday morning on his Truth Social platform that he had given Iran \"chance after chance\" to make a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, but that despite his warnings to Tehran that the alternative would be \"much worse\" than anything seen before, \"they just couldn't get it done.\"",
      "\"There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left.\"",
      "In a later post on Friday, Mr. Trump said he \"gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to 'make a deal.' They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn't get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!\"",
      "Israel has intercepted virtually every Iranian weapon launched in previous large-scale attacks by the Islamic republic. The retaliatory action by Iran was long anticipated and well planned for, Defrin said.",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Friday on Iranian TV that the country would \"strongly take action\" against Israel in response to the attacks, promising \"a severe, wise and strong answer.\"",
      "\"The Iranian nation and the country's officials will not remain silent in the face of this crime, and the legitimate and powerful response of the Islamic Republic of Iran will make the enemy regret its foolish act,\" he said.",
      "Israel says it destroyed Iran's air defenses, killed top commanders",
      "Earlier Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the IDF had begun \"Operation Rising Lion,\" with a massive wave of airstrikes against dozens of Iranian nuclear sites, military commanders and research scientists, saying the goal was to \"roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival.\"",
      "Like Netanyahu, Defrin, the IDF spokesman, called the attack on Iran preemptive in a video statement delivered Friday, saying Israeli intelligence had uncovered an Iranian \"plan to destroy Israel that has taken shape in recent years.\" He said that plan involved Iran \"racing towards a nuclear bomb,\" working to double or triple its ballistic missile stockpile, and continuing to \"finance, arm, and operate its proxies throughout the Middle East against the State of Israel.\"",
      "\"I can confirm that the senior security leadership of the Iranian regime has been eliminated in the strike: the Iranian Chief of Staff, [Mohammad] Bagheri; the Commander of the Revolutionary Guards, [Hossein] Salami; and the Head of the Emergency Command, [Gholamali] Rashid,\" Defrin said, adding that other commanders had been killed and that Israeli would provide further updates. He said Israel had \"targeted and struck the Iranian regime's aerial defense arrays.\"",
      "The IDF said its operation would continue for days, but that the first wave consisted of 200 Israeli fighter jets dropping \"over 330 different munitions,\" to hit more than 100 targets in Iran.",
      "\"The breadth and scale of these strikes \u2014 against senior Iranian officials and other military facilities in addition to nuclear sites \u2014 suggest this operation is intended to not just dissuade Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons, but also cripple any potential military response and even to destabilize the regime,\" Matthew Savill, director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a British military think tank, said in a statement.",
      "\"Israel has once again demonstrated its considerable conventional military superiority, and the size of the force allegedly assembled for this series of attacks represents the overwhelming bulk of their longer-range strike aircraft. They have the ability to conduct multiple such rounds of strikes, but operating for an extended duration over this considerable range will stretch even the Israeli Air Force,\" Savill said.",
      "Savill said Iran's response \"might be delayed or split into multiple phases, but their main weapon will be ballistic missiles, which have the best chance of inflicting damage on Israel, whereas drone and cruise missile attacks will face more extensive Israeli defenses. Israel operations have therefore targeted air defenses and ballistic missile sites to forestall this.\"",
      "Savill said that if Iran \"believes the U.S. or others were involved\" in the Israeli strike, then their retaliation could include targeting the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, and American air facilities in Qatar, \"though both would widen the conflict to drag in others.\"",
      "NATO chief urges de-escalation, says nuclear clash \"not close\"",
      "Iranian state media said the Israeli strikes had hit several cities, including in the capital of Tehran and the city of Natanz, a key center for Iran's uranium enrichment program. The IDF said it struck Iran's uranium enrichment site in the Natanz area.",
      "\"The underground area of the site was damaged,\" the IDF said in a statement. \"This area contains a multi-story enrichment hall with centrifuges, electrical rooms, and additional supporting infrastructure. In addition, critical infrastructure enabling the site's continuous operation and the Iranian regime's ongoing efforts to obtain nuclear weapons were targeted.\"",
      "The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said in a series of social media posts that its director-general, Rafael Grossi, had been in contact with Iranian authorities on Friday, who told him the country's highly sensitive and highly secured Fordo nuclear site \"has not been impacted\" by the Israeli strikes. Later Friday, Reuters reported that two explosions had been heard near the site and that state media said Iranian air defenses had shot down an Israeli drone near the facility.",
      "The IAEA also said Iran's \"Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant had not been targeted and that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site.\"",
      "On Friday, during a visit to Sweden, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told reporters that \"this was a unilateral action by Israel. So I think it is crucial for many allies, including the United States, to work as we speak to de-escalate.\"",
      "Despite the ongoing attacks, Rutte said he believed the region was \"not close\" to a possible nuclear conflict.",
      "While there have been no claims that Iran has yet built a nuclear weapon, Israel is believed to have multiple warheads, though it has never formally confirmed nor denied its status as a nuclear-armed nation.",
      "Iranian officials quickly threatened retaliation to the attack, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying Israel \"should await a harsh response.\"",
      "The IDF said in a statement before Iran's retaliatory strikes that it had prepared for \"a campaign on the frontline and on the home front.\"",
      "Netanyahu said Israel's strikes against Iran, \"will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.\"",
      "Shortly after Israel's strikes, the U.S. Embassy in Israel ordered American personnel to shelter in place.",
      "A day beforehand, the Trump administration\u00a0ordered\u00a0non-emergency U.S. personnel to leave Iraq and allowed U.S. military family members to leave the Middle East voluntarily.",
      "Risk of an escalating regional conflict",
      "Israel has carried out strikes against Iranian proxies in recent years, while Iran has backed foes of Israel, including the militant group Hamas.",
      "In April of last year, Iran\u00a0launched missiles and drones\u00a0at Israel after a strike on Iran's consulate\u00a0in Damascus\u00a0was widely attributed to Israel, but the Israeli military intercepted the vast majority of the weapons.",
      "Six months later, Iran\u00a0launched more\u00a0missiles at Israel, which retaliated with strikes on Iranian sites.",
      "Friday's back-and-forth could escalate to be among the most severe clashes between Israel and Iran, which have been adversaries for decades. Mr. Trump warned earlier in the week that the strikes could snowball into a \"massive\" conflict.",
      "Farea Al-Muslimi, a research fellow at the Chatham House think tank, said in a statement Friday that the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen could play a role in the Iranian response to Israel.",
      "\"With Iran currently weakened and humiliated, this marks the first time the Houthis will be called upon to repay decades of Iranian investment and support,\" Al-Muslimi predicted. \"Following the killing of Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon and the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis have effectively become Iran's first line of defense against Israel \u2014 an increasingly central role.\"",
      "Al-Muslimi said the Houthi response could extend beyond retaliatory strikes on Israel itself.",
      "\"Strikes in the Red Sea will likely resume, the ceasefire with the United States may unravel, and we shouldn't be surprised if Saudi Arabia and the UAE are dragged back into direct conflict in Yemen,\" Al-Muslimi said. \"Attacks by the Houthis on U.S. military bases in the Gulf, the Horn of Africa, and naval forces at sea are also highly plausible.\"",
      "Fabian Hinz, an air warfare expert at London's International Institute of Strategic Studies, told the Associated Press that Iran's current capabilities are potentially \"more threatening to the U.S. military than to Israel.\"",
      "Iran has a \"huge arsenal\" of shorter-range missiles, Hinz said, and there are a number of U.S. military bases in the region. He said Iran also has \"lots of anti-ship capabilities.\"",
      "\"Think of the Iranian shipping threat as similar in quality to the Houthi threat, but much larger in quantity,\" Hinz told the AP.",
      "Israeli attack casts doubt on fate of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks",
      "The Israeli strikes and Iranian counterattack came amid efforts by President Trump to strike a new deal with Iran to limit the country's nuclear ambitions \u2014 an idea Israel has long been dubious of.",
      "The U.S. and Iran were set to hold talks Sunday, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News. There was no immediate comment from any high-ranking Iranian officials that those plans would change after Israel's attack, but some reports in Iranian media outlets indicated Iran would likely no longer participate in the negotiations.",

    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

Testifying under a pseudonym, Jane told the jury about her relationship with Diddy from 2021 until his arrest in 2024. She claimed Diddy forced her into participating in \"hotel nights\" where the \"Last Night\" rapper expected her to have sex with a male escort while he watched.",
      "\"Overall, the testimony this week from Jane could have been puzzling to the jury,\" defense attorney John W. Day told Fox News Digital. \"Did she pull together for jurors the web of Diddy's control and intimidation that builds the foundation for RICO convictions? She did say she felt like a 'sex worker in my own relationship,' which suggests an element of control on Diddy's part.\"",

She testified as a prosecution witness, but did she raise more questions than she answered in the mind of the jurors about why she continued to engage with Diddy? I believe the testimony from Jane cuts both ways,\" Day noted.",

      "Jane's dayslong testimony \"painted a portrait\" similar to that of Diddy's ex, Cassie Ventura. However, one legal expert told Fox News Digital Jane's allegations might not be enough to convince a jury Diddy's behavior was criminal.",
      "\"Jane\u2019s testimony highlighted the defendant's use of his wealth and resources, factors which were portrayed by the prosecutors as a means to control and force these women into sexual situations with paid male escorts, or, by the defense, to foster loving consensual relationships that happened to include sex with male prostitutes,\" John J. Perlstein, a Los Angeles based litigator, told Fox News Digital. \"I think the most interesting part is that the defendant\u2019s conduct isn\u2019t in dispute \u2013 it's simply up to the jury to decide whether that conduct was, in fact, criminal.\"",

      "Jane's testimony gave the jury insight into how Diddy reacted when surveillance footage of the rapper attacking Cassie Ventura went public in May 2024. Jane said she was dating Diddy at the time and was at his home, where she allegedly witnessed his family come together to make a game plan for his response.",

      "\"So she [allegedly] experienced domestic violence firsthand in the relationship,\" Day explained. \"In fact, she said that occurred not long after the video of Cassie being assaulted at a hotel showed up on television. It\u2019s rare for a witness to provide such a 360-degree view of what role violence plays in a defendant\u2019s relationship with women.\"",

The \"hotel night\" allegedly lasted three days and involved three different men. After the alleged sex session, Jane confronted Diddy about a trip he took another woman on.",
      "Jane read her text message to Diddy in court. She wrote, \"It's not right how you're treating me right now and how you're doing me. We had such an amazing New Year's Eve week together, and the last thing I would expect from you is coming at me sideways about a girl you like. To even be speaking to me about another female, worried about her to me, is something I've never seen before. You completely had your way and more with New Year's Eve week, just to send me home to worry about a doctor's visit, handling entertainment, accuse me of lying, then take another girl on vacation. Ignoring us for days to prioritize that right now shows where your care is, and it's not for me. Cold. I'd never make you feel like that. We have been so good. You were telling me you love me, I'm your baby, how you're not going to use me, all to treat me like this. Why? You have me feeling so taken advantage of and regretting everything.\"",
      "Diddy's ex-girlfriend testified during the fifth week of trial. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "A legal expert explained why Jane's testimony could be seen as harmful to the prosecution.",
      "\"The danger for the prosecution is that jurors might see in this testimony reasons why a person might feel scorned by Diddy and now be happy to seek revenge,\" Day explained. \"This kind of witness testimony is relatable to jurors, whether they have personal experience or know people who have gone through a horrendous moment in a relationship.\"",

And there were text messages from her to Combs in which she said she's not a sex robot, porn star or animal and that she didn't want to have sex with strangers. We heard audio of Jane asking the sex workers to wear a condom and Combs telling them not to. That's evidence of force and coercion for sex trafficking.\"",

      "Jane testified that Diddy was still paying for her lawyer and her rent. During cross-examination, the rapper's defense confirmed he had never interfered with Jane's representation.",
      "\"Another part of Jane\u2019s testimony that probably came as a shock to some people was when she said that Diddy is still paying for her lawyer. But lawyers watching the trial understand this type of arrangement is fairly common,\" Day explained. \"It may, however, raise questions with jurors about conflicts of interest and motivation. Jurors might look at this arrangement as questionable and that would affect their perception of what Jane has testified to.\"",

      "Cybernews researchers have discovered a misconfigured MongoDB database exposing 2.7 million patient profiles and 8.8 million appointment records. The database was publicly accessible online, unprotected by passwords or authentication protocols. Anyone with basic knowledge of database scanning tools could have accessed it.",
      "The exposed data included names, birthdates, addresses, emails, phone numbers, gender, chart IDs, language preferences and billing classifications. Appointment records also contained metadata such as timestamps and institutional identifiers.",

      "Clues within the data structure point toward Gargle, a Utah-based company that builds websites and offers marketing tools for dental practices. While not a confirmed source, several internal references and system details suggest a strong connection. Gargle provides appointment scheduling, form submission and patient communication services. These functions require access to patient information, making the firm a likely link in the exposure.",
      "After the issue was reported, the database was secured. The duration of the exposure remains unknown, and there is no public evidence indicating whether the data was downloaded by malicious actors before being locked down.",

      "The exposed data presents a broad risk profile. On its own, a phone number or billing record might seem limited in scope. Combined, however, the dataset forms a complete profile that could be exploited for identity theft, insurance fraud and targeted phishing campaigns.",
      "Medical identity theft allows attackers to impersonate patients and access services under a false identity. Victims often remain unaware until significant damage is done, ranging from incorrect medical records to unpaid bills in their names. The leak also opens the door to insurance fraud, with actors using institutional references and chart data to submit false claims.",
      "This type of breach raises questions about compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which mandates strong security protections for entities handling patient data. Although Gargle is not a healthcare provider, its access to patient-facing infrastructure could place it under the scope of that regulation as a business associate.",

      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If nothing else, this latest leak shows just how poorly patient data is being handled today. More and more, non-medical vendors are getting access to sensitive information without facing the same rules or oversight as hospitals and clinics. These third-party services are now a regular part of how patients book appointments, pay bills or fill out forms. But when something goes wrong, the fallout is just as serious. Even though the database was taken offline, the bigger problem hasn't gone away. Your data is only as safe as the least careful company that gets access to it.",

    "story": [
      "The technology combines direct air capture with on-site fuel synthesis, providing fossil-free gasoline.",
      "Recently, Aircela, a fuel company headquartered in New York, publicly demonstrated a machine in Manhattan that produces gasoline directly from air.",
      "The event attracted city and state officials, investors and energy professionals who witnessed the launch of this compact, refrigerator-sized unit.",

      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Understanding the science behind Aircela's technology",
      "Led by co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren (pictured on the right below), Aircela has\u00a0developed a machine that produces real, engine-ready gasoline from just air and water, powered by renewable electricity and advanced chemical processes.\u00a0The technology is based on direct air capture research, notably the work of physicist Klaus Lackner (shown on the left below), and is designed for easy installation in residential, commercial and industrial settings.",
      "The process begins by drawing in ambient air and using a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide to efficiently capture carbon dioxide. As air flows through a specially designed chamber, the liquid sorbent absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then regenerated for repeated use. Next, the system uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The hydrogen is retained for the fuel synthesis process, while the oxygen is safely released into the environment.",
      "FLYING CAR WITH 620-MILE RANGE SCHEDULED FOR UPCOMING LAUNCH",
      "The captured carbon dioxide and generated hydrogen are then combined to create methanol, which is subsequently converted into gasoline using established chemical processes. The resulting gasoline contains no sulfur, ethanol or heavy metals, making it fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Each Aircela unit can produce approximately one gallon of gasoline per day from around 22 pounds of captured carbon dioxide with a storage capacity of up to 17 gallons. This innovative machine enables users to generate fossil-free gasoline on site using only air, water and renewable electricity.",
      "Physicist Klaus Lackner, at left, and Eric Dahlgren, co-founder and CEO of Aircela, at right\u00a0\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Distributed production sets Aircela apart",
      "Unlike traditional synthetic fuel projects that rely on large, centralized plants, Aircela's approach is modular and distributed. Each unit can produce gasoline on site, making it suitable for off-grid locations, ports, islands or emergency situations. This design allows users to access cleaner fuel without the need to alter their vehicles or fueling routines.",

Moller-Maersk. During the demonstration, Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk's head of energy transition, emphasized the machine's potential to support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the shipping and logistics industries.",
      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Environmental and practical advantages",
      "The process developed by Aircela is intended to be carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide released when the gasoline is burned is balanced by the amount captured during production. The gasoline works with current engines and fueling systems, so there is no need for costly upgrades. Distributed production reduces reliance on centralized refineries and long supply chains. In addition, the fuel's purity, free from sulfur and additives, helps lower harmful emissions beyond just carbon dioxide.",

The company's goal is to increase production, reduce costs and make the technology widely available. While the current output is modest, Aircela aims to provide a practical, climate-aligned alternative to fossil fuels that does not require people to change their vehicles or daily habits.",

      "Aircela's gasoline-from-air machine shows that sometimes the best solutions are the ones that fit right into our daily routines. Instead of requiring new cars or major changes, this technology lets people keep using what they already have, just with cleaner fuel. Watching carbon pulled from the air and turned into gasoline on the spot feels like a practical step toward a more sustainable future.",

If only your social media profile pops up, there\u2019s no need to worry. However, people finder sites tend to relist your private information, including your home address, after some time.",
      "4. Limit sharing your address online:\u00a0Be careful about sharing your home address on social media, online forms and apps. Review privacy settings regularly, and only provide your address when absolutely necessary. Also, adjust your phone settings so that apps don\u2019t track your location.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your home address is more vulnerable than you think. People finder sites aggregate data from public records and private sources to display your address online, often without your knowledge or consent. This can lead to serious privacy and safety risks. Taking proactive steps to protect your home address is essential. Do it manually or use a data removal tool for an easier process. By understanding how your location is collected and taking measures to remove your address from online sites, you can reclaim control over your personal data.",

      "1. Don\u2019t overshare: Even with AI tools like ChatGPT",
      "AI chatbots like ChatGPT are useful, but they're not private journals. The platform owners may have privacy policies and use the latest security measures, but that doesn't mean you should let your guard down. When using these tools, refrain from sharing any personal information, such as your name, address, birthdate, passwords, financial details or sensitive conversations. Remember that AI systems store and process your inputs, and despite security promises, data breaches can occur.",

      "2. Use alias email addresses",
      "Your email is often the key to your online identity and a common target for spam. By creating disposable email aliases that forward messages to your main inbox, you can keep your real address hidden from websites and services. These unique aliases act as shields, so if one starts getting spammed or is involved in a data breach, you can simply deactivate it without affecting your main email account.",
      "My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is\u00a0to use an alias email address. An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail or having your information taken in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

The malware turns home electronics into participants in a global network of cybercrime, often before the user even powers them on.",
      "In a statement, the FBI says BadBox 2.0 is commonly found on cheap Android-based devices manufactured in mainland China. These include uncertified tablets, connected TV boxes and other Internet of Things hardware. Many of the infected devices ship with the malware preinstalled. Others are compromised during setup, often through malicious firmware updates or sideloaded apps from unofficial marketplaces.",

Essentially, your smart TV could be quietly helping someone break into other people\u2019s accounts.",
      "The botnet is primarily used to turn infected devices into residential proxy nodes, providing hackers with anonymous access to real home IP addresses.

The original botnet was briefly disrupted in Germany in 2024 when security researchers \"sinkholed\" the malware's command servers. That wiped out part of the operation, but not for long. Just a week later, the malware reappeared on nearly 200,000 devices, including more recognizable brands like Hisense smartphones and Yandex TVs.",
      "By March 2025, BadBox had evolved into BadBox 2.0, with more than 1 million active infections detected by HUMAN\u2019s Satori Threat Intelligence team. The majority of devices are uncertified Android Open Source Project builds.\u00a0These are not official Android TV OS products and are not protected by Google Play Protect.",

      "The FBI, working with Google, Trend Micro, HUMAN and the Shadowserver Foundation, recently disrupted communications between more than 500,000 infected devices and their control servers. However, the botnet continues to grow as more compromised products reach consumers and remain unnoticed.",
      "Symptoms of infection include strange app marketplaces, disabled Play Protect settings or devices advertised as being unlocked or capable of free streaming. Many of these products come from unknown brands and are sold through unofficial sellers.

      "1. You bought a low-cost Android-based device from an unknown or no-name brand:\u00a0Devices sold online through third-party sellers or unknown brands, especially if advertised as \"unlocked,\" \"jailbroken\" or offering free streaming, are at higher risk. Models like the T95 box or other generic Android TV boxes are known carriers. Specifically, the following devices have been identified as impacted by BadBox malware:",
      "Device model: TV98, X96Q_Max_P, Q96L2, X96Q2, X96mini, S168, ums512_1h10_Natv, X96_S400, X96mini_RP, TX3mini, HY-001, MX10PRO, X96mini_Plus1, LongTV_GN7501E, Xtv77, NETBOX_B68, X96Q_PR01, AV-M9, ADT-3, OCBN, X96MATE_PLUS, KM1, X96Q_PRO, Projector_T6P, X96QPRO-TM, sp7731e_1h10_native, M8SPROW, TV008, X96Mini_5G, Q96MAX, Orbsmart_TR43, Z6, TVBOX, Smart, KM9PRO, A15, Transpeed, KM7, iSinbox, I96, SMART_TV, Fujicom-SmartTV, MXQ9PRO, MBOX, X96Q, isinbox, Mbox, R11, GameBox, KM6, X96Max_Plus2, TV007, Q9 Stick, SP7731E, H6, X88, X98K, TXCZ",
      "2. Your device is not Google-certified:\u00a0If your Android device doesn't support\u00a0Google Play Protect or doesn't show the\u00a0Play Protect certification in the Play Store settings, it's likely running on an uncertified version of Android. That's a major red flag. To check:",

      "3. Suspicious behavior or strange apps:\u00a0Look for unfamiliar apps you didn't install, apps labeled with foreign characters or alternative app stores on your device. BadBox-infected devices often come with shady apps preloaded.",
      "4. Google Play Protect is disabled:\u00a0If Play Protect has been turned off without your knowledge or is missing altogether, your device may be vulnerable to compromise.",
      "5. Your home internet is acting strange:\u00a0If your network is unusually slow or your router shows unknown devices connected, one of your smart devices may be hijacked and rerouting traffic as part of a residential proxy network.",

Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Only buy certified and trusted devices:\u00a0Stick to devices certified by Google or other recognized platforms. Avoid generic or off-brand Android boxes, tablets and projectors, especially if they are advertised as unlocked or include free streaming. Cheap, uncertified devices are more likely to come with malware preinstalled.",
      "3. Avoid sideloading apps from unofficial sources:\u00a0Do not install apps from third-party app stores or download APK files from unknown websites. These files can contain hidden malware. Use only official app stores like the Google Play Store that scan apps for threats.",
      "4. Check your device settings for tampering:\u00a0Look for signs like Google Play Protect being turned off, the presence of unfamiliar app stores or suspicious apps running in the background. These are possible signs your device is compromised.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Monitor your network for unusual activity:\u00a0If your internet slows down suddenly, or you notice unknown devices on your Wi-Fi, investigate. Use your router's settings or a network monitoring app to track strange behavior or unauthorized connections.",
      "6. Disconnect and replace suspicious hardware:\u00a0If a device is behaving oddly or was purchased from an untrusted source, unplug it from your network. Consider replacing it with a product from a reputable brand and a verified seller.",
      "7. Keep your devices and apps updated:\u00a0Install system and app updates regularly. Even though cheap devices may not always offer updates,\u00a0keeping your software current reduces your risk. Choose brands that are known for providing reliable security patches.",
      "8. Secure your router and home network:\u00a0Your devices are only as safe as the network they're connected to. Set a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi router and update its firmware regularly. Disable remote access unless absolutely necessary and use WPA3 encryption if available. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "It's alarming how something as simple as a budget streaming box or projector could be quietly working for cybercriminals.

      "Atom Bodies' flagship product, Atom Touch, is setting a new standard in prosthetic arms. Unlike traditional prosthetics, which often offer only basic movement and can be uncomfortable to wear, Atom Touch uses EMG (electromyography) sensors placed on the user's skin to detect muscle activity. These signals are then interpreted by machine-learning algorithms, allowing users to control individual fingers, the wrist and the elbow with remarkable precision just by thinking about the movement they want to make.",

It is the first prosthetic arm to offer true individual finger movement, which means users can perform tasks like typing, gripping and delicate manipulation with much greater ease. The device uses the Atom A1 AI neural interface, which learns from the user's muscle signals to provide seamless, natural movement. Dozens of sensors in the hand generate haptic feedback, so users can better gauge grip strength and control. With more than 10 motors in the hand alone, Atom Touch offers a near-human range of motion and dexterity. The load-balanced harness system also makes the arm lighter than a human arm and comfortable enough for extended wear, addressing a challenge that many current prosthetics have yet to solve.",

Atom Touch is designed for initial wear of four to six hours, with the goal of achieving all-day use. Atom Bodies has already attracted significant interest, with over 11,000 people on its\u00a0wait list and plans to begin clinical trials within the next year, pending FDA approval.",

      "Atom Touch pricing: How affordable is this advanced prosthetic arm?",
      "One of the most transformative aspects of Atom Touch is its price point. While state-of-the-art myoelectric arms can cost around $200,000, Atom Bodies plans to offer Atom Touch for approximately $25,000. This brings the cost in line with basic hook prosthetics, making advanced bionic limbs accessible to a much larger population.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Apple\u2019s iPad has a strong reputation for security. Thanks to the system architecture of iOS, a non-jailbroken iPad isn\u2019t susceptible to typical viruses or malware infections. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s completely safe from every threat. As with any computer, there are still vulnerabilities that determined hackers can exploit.",
      "iPads are generally secure devices, but it\u2019s still possible for hackers to gain access, so knowing the warning signs of a hacked iPad can help you act quickly to protect your data. Moreover, an iPad often contains a lot of personal information about you and your family, so if it\u2019s ever hacked, it can be quite alarming.",

      "How to tell if your iPad has been hacked",
      "Be on the lookout for these signs that could indicate your iPad\u2019s security has been compromised:",
      "If your iPad suddenly feels more like a sluggish turtle than the speedy device it used to be, that\u2019s a warning sign. When a device is hacked, malicious software might be running in the background, using up memory and processing power. This can make apps slow to open, cause lagging or freezing and even lead to more frequent crashes. You might also notice the battery draining much faster than usual along with the slowdown, since unwanted software can chew through battery life while it secretly runs in the background.",
      "A sudden flood of pop-up ads or strange messages on your iPad screen is a big red flag. Under normal circumstances, iPads should not bombard you with random pop-ups, especially outside of safe apps or websites. If you start seeing lots of unsolicited ads or \"Your iPad is hacked!\" alerts popping up, it could mean an adware program or scam has found its way onto the device. These pop-ups might try to trick you or your kids into clicking links or downloading something harmful, so they\u2019re not just annoying, they\u2019re dangerous signs that something is wrong.",
      "An Apple iPad (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT AN IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE 2025",
      "Keep an eye on how the iPad is using the internet. An unusual spike in data usage or constant network activity (even when no one is actively using the iPad) might indicate the device is secretly sending or receiving information without your permission. For example, if your data plan suddenly maxes out or you notice the Wi-Fi icon flickering with activity when the iPad is idle, it could be a sign that a hacker\u2019s software is communicating in the background. Such suspicious network activity is concerning because it suggests someone else might be remotely accessing the iPad or siphoning off personal data.",
      "HOW TO TRANSFER INFO FROM AN OLD IPAD TO A NEW IPAD",
      "One clear warning sign is finding changes to your Apple account that you didn\u2019t make. If your Apple ID password was changed without your knowledge or you receive security alerts about logins you never did, be wary; a hacker may have gained access to your account.",
      "You might also discover that account details or settings (like your recovery email or trusted phone number) have been altered. Another clue is seeing unfamiliar charges or App Store purchases on your Apple ID bill, since unauthorized purchases or subscriptions often mean that someone has compromised your account and is using it maliciously.",

      "Top tips to protect your iPad from hackers and malware",
      "If you suspect your iPad has been hacked, taking immediate action can secure your device and give you peace of mind. Here are a few basic steps to help you respond:",
      "1) Reset your passwords: Change your Apple ID password right away (and any other important account passwords used on the iPad) to lock out any intruders. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Remove unfamiliar apps: Check the iPad for any apps you or your child didn\u2019t install. If you find an unknown app or a suspicious profile, delete it immediately. This helps eliminate any malicious programs the hacker may have added. To do this, open\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0General\u00a0>\u00a0iPad Storage, scroll to find the unfamiliar app, tap\u00a0it, then tap\u00a0Delete App and confirm.",
      "3) Update iOS: Make sure the iPad is running the latest version of iPadOS. Apple frequently releases security updates to fix vulnerabilities, so\u00a0updating the software can shut down any loopholes the hacker might have used. Turning on automatic updates is a good idea to stay protected going forward.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication: If you haven\u2019t already,\u00a0turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account. This feature adds an extra verification step (like a code sent to your phone) whenever someone tries to sign in, which can stop hackers in their tracks even if they somehow know your password. It\u2019s an excellent safeguard to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus protection on all devices: Malware, spyware and viruses can run quietly in the background or compromise enough data before it is discovered. While not being hacked in the first place is the best position to be in, it is worse to give access to your iPad\u2019s data to a hacker for a prolonged period of time. That\u2019s why having strong antivirus software running consistently in the background of your device is a great way to prevent compromises from happening in the first place.\u00a0Best antivirus security software and apps to protect you.",
      "CAN IPHONE TEXTS HAVE MALWARE? SPOT & AVOID SMS SCAMS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s important to remember that many of these symptoms can have innocent explanations, so don\u2019t panic at the first sign of trouble. For example, a new iOS update or a heavy app can temporarily slow down your iPad\u2019s performance, so one isolated issue doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019ve been hacked. However, if you notice multiple warning signs at the same time or anything that just doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s best to act quickly and err on the side of caution.",

      "\"In sex trafficking cases, deception, drugs, and false pretenses, like promises of luxury travel, could be considered important facts if it goes to the force, fraud or coercion of the sex trafficking,\" Hyman said. \"And thus could have legal weight to prove a case as the prosecution has the burden to prove the charges against a defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. It is ultimately up to the jury as they are the trier of facts, and the jury will decide what weight to give these facts based on the evidence presented.\"",

He was deported to an El Salvadoran prison in what the government initially called an \"administrative error.\" The case rose to the Supreme Court, which ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" his return. The Trump administration held out against pushing for that for nearly two months before Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States early this month to face federal charges alleging human smuggling.",
      "Views of the Supreme Court",
      "The poll found that 55% of Americans have favorable opinions of the Supreme Court, while 45% view it unfavorably.",
      "Republicans are more supportive of the court than Democrats: 75% view it favorably, compared with 34% with favorable views among Democrats.",
      "Yet one key finding is that Americans generally don\u2019t hold strong views of the Supreme Court right now: 11% have strongly favorable opinions, while 12% are strongly unfavorable. The large remainder rates the court \"somewhat\" favorably or unfavorably.",
      "The poll was conducted ahead of the Supreme Court's traditional season for its highest-profile rulings, and it has yet to rule this year on contentious cases like one concerning birthright citizenship, which could affect public opinion of the court.",
      "The court isn't expected to rule on the merits of whether Trump can end birthright citizenship, which has long been considered a clear right under the 14th Amendment, via executive order. Rather, the current case focuses on the power of judges to block presidential policies through nationwide injunctions.",
      "If the court rules in Trump\u2019s favor, district judges would be limited from using nationwide injunctions to temporarily block an administration policy. There have been at least 39 such rulings during Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last month that he has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for the Supreme Court.",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey was conducted online from May 30-June 10 among a national sample of 19,410 adults ages 18 and over. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.1 percentage points."

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Shohei Ohtani is going to be the starting pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday night against San Diego, 21 months after the two-way star had elbow surgery.",
      "The Dodgers made the announcement after Sunday night's 5-4 win over San Francisco. Ohtani likely will be used as an opener as the NL West leaders kick off a four-game set against the visiting Padres.",
      "\"Shohei is getting antsy, which is a good thing for us,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before the team announced Ohtani would get the ball on Monday night.",
      "\"I don't know if it's going to be one or two innings, but my guess is probably an inning to start. But it's a good thing. The live, simulated, or whatever, sort of ran its course. He's ready to make his debut on the mound.\"",
      "Ohtani has not pitched in a game since Aug. 23, 2023, when he got hurt during a start for the Los Angeles Angels against Cincinnati. He had Tommy John surgery on Oct. 1, 2018, and is recovering from right elbow surgery on Sept. 19, 2023.",
      "In the second season of a $700 million, 10-year contract, he paused his pitching work after a mound session on Feb. 25 to prepare for opening day as a hitter, then started bullpen sessions on March 29 and batting practice on May 25.",
      "Roberts said he is excited to see Ohtani pitch in a big league game again.",
      "\"There's been a lot of anticipation,\" he said. \"I think we've done it the right way as far as our process, communicating with Shohei and feeling good. ... It's good for our team. Our guys are excited about this potential. And obviously, most important, I'm excited for Shohei.\"",
      "A three-time MVP, Ohtani is hitting .297 with an NL-leading 1.035 OPS, 25 homers and 41 RBIs. A batter only last year in his first season with the Dodgers, Ohtani hit .290 with 54 homers, 130 RBIs and 59 stolen bases.",
      "On Sunday, Roberts said rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki appears likely to be sidelined for a lengthy stretch. With Sasaki (right shoulder impingement), Blake Snell (left shoulder inflammation) and Tyler Glasnow (right shoulder inflammation) on the injured list, the Dodgers have resorted to bullpen games.",
      "Sasaki has not pitched in a game since May 9 and is not part of the team's long-term pitching plans this season.",
      "\"I think that's what the mindset should be,\" Roberts said before the game. \"Being thrust into this environment certainly was a big undertaking for him, and now you layer in the health part and the fact he's a starting pitcher, knowing what the build-up (required to return) entails \u2026 I think that's the prudent way to go about it.\"",
      "Sasaki, 23, went 1-1 with a 4.72 ERA in eight starts after joining the Dodgers from the Pacific League's Chiba Lotte Marines, averaging less than 4 1/3 innings per start. His walked 22 and struck out 24 in 34 1/3 innings and his fastball averaged 95.7 mph, down 3-4 mph from his average in Japan.",
      "Roberts said Sasaki was pain-free when he resumed throwing in early June, but the pitcher was shut down after feeling discomfort this past week. Sasaki recently received a cortisone injection in the shoulder; Roberts said no further scans are planned.",
      "\"I don't think it's pain,\" Roberts said. \"I don't know if it's discomfort, if it's tightness, if he's just not feeling strong, whatever the adjective you want to use. That's more of a question for Roki, as far as the sensation he's feeling.",
      "\"He's just not feeling like he can ramp it up, and we're not going to push him to do something he doesn't feel good about right now.\""

      "Flash flooding caused by torrential rains killed five people in northern West Virginia and rescue crews were searching for three other people who were missing Sunday as authorities assessed damage to roads, bridges, natural gas lines and other infrastructure.",
      "Officials said 2.5 to 4 inches of rain fell in parts of Wheeling and Ohio County within about a half hour on Saturday night.",
      "\"We almost immediately started getting 911 calls for rescue of people being trapped,\" Lou Vargo, Ohio County's emergency management director, said at a news conference Sunday. \"During this time, we had major infrastructure damage to roads, bridges, and highways where we couldn't respond to a lot of incidents. So we were delayed in getting there because there was just so much damage.\"",
      "Vargo added: \"It happened so quickly and so fast. \u2026 I've been doing this for 35 years. I've seen major floods here in the city and the county. I've never seen anything like this.\"",
      "Authorities said vehicles were swept into swollen creeks, some people sought safety in trees and a mobile home caught fire.",
      "Similarly, swift flash flooding arrived in Marion County, south of Wheeling and Ohio County, early Sunday afternoon, causing extensive damage to bridges, roads and some homes, the county's Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Management said in a Facebook post. The county's 911 line has already processed at least 165 calls for service since the storms began.",
      "Gov. Patrick Morrisey declared a state of emergency in Marion County Sunday evening.",
      "Jim Blazier, the fire chief in Wheeling in the state's northern panhandle, said crews performed rescue operations into Sunday's early morning hours. He said first responders regrouped Sunday morning and were focused on an area from the Ohio state line across the Ohio River to Wheeling Creek.",
      "\"We're searching the banks, we're searching submerged vehicles, any debris we find along the trail and so forth,\" Blazier said. \"We're using drones, search dogs and swift water personnel, and we have teams organized that are searching sectors that we're trying to recover anybody that's missing.\"",
      "There were about 2,500 reported power outages in the county Sunday, Morrisey confirmed in a news release Sunday evening, which updated the number of people confirmed dead to five, with three more missing. He has declared a state of emergency in Ohio County and mobilized the National Guard to support emergency operations.",
      "\"In many respects, this is kind of a unicorn event, because a lot of the rain had very narrow areas and there were roughly 3 to 4 inches of water that fell in the area in less than an hour,\" Morrisey said at a press conference earlier Sunday. \"That's very, very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "He added, \"Your friends, your neighbors, your first responders and people in the community, they're out working very hard to find people. That's our No. 1 task right now, trying to identify anyone who may still be out there.\"",

      "OTTAWA, Ontario \u2014 Britain\u2019s real-life spies have finally caught up with James Bond. MI6 has appointed its first female chief.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Sunday that Blaise Metreweli will be the next head of the U.K.\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, and the first woman to hold the post since its founding in 1909. She is currently the MI6 director of technology and innovation \u2014 the real-world equivalent of Bond gadget-master Q.",
      "A career intelligence officer, Metreweli, 47, steps from the shadows into the light as the only MI6 employee whose name is made public. She said \u201cI am proud and honored to be asked to lead my Service.\u201d",
      "Starmer said the \u201chistoric appointment\u201d comes at a time \u201cwhen the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital.",
      "\u201cThe United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale \u2014 be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber plots seek to disrupt our public services,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer made the announcement as he arrived in the Canadian province of Alberta for a Group of Seven leaders\u2019 summit.",
      "Metreweli takes over at MI6 as the agency faces growing challenges from states including China and Russia, whose use of cyber tools, espionage and influence operations threatens global stability and British interests, even as it remains on alert against terrorist threats.",
      "Metreweli is the first woman to get the top job, known as C \u2014 rather than M, the fictional MI6 chief of the 007 thrillers. M was played onscreen by Judi Dench in seven Bond movies starting in the 1990s.",
      "She will take up her post in the fall, replacing Richard Moore, who has held the job for five years.",
      "Britain\u2019s two other main intelligence agencies have already shattered the spy world\u2019s glass ceiling. MI5, the domestic security service, was led by Stella Rimington from 1992 to 1996 and Eliza Manningham-Buller from 2002 to 2007. Anne Keast-Butler became head of electronic and cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ in 2023.",
      "Moore, an Oxford-educated former diplomat, fit the 007 mold like a Savile Row suit. But in recent years MI6 has worked to increase diversity, broadening its recruitment process from the traditional \u201ctap on the shoulder\u201d at an elite university. The agency\u2019s website stresses its family-friendly flexible working policy and goal of recruiting \u201ctalented people from all backgrounds.\u201d",
      "Moore suggested he would like his successor to be a woman. He wrote on X in 2023 that he would \u201chelp forge women\u2019s equality by working to ensure I\u2019m the last C selected from an all-male shortlist.\u201d",
      "Like many things about MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service, the process of choosing a new chief took place out of public view. It began with the country\u2019s top civil servant writing to government departments in March asking them to put forward candidates. The job was open to applicants from other intelligence agencies, the civil service, the diplomatic service, the armed forces or the police.",
      "In the end, MI6 opted for an internal candidate with a 25-year career in espionage, a degree in anthropology from Cambridge University \u2014 where she was on the women\u2019s rowing team \u2014 and expertise in cutting-edge technology.",
      "\u201cAt a time of global instability and emerging security threats, where technology is power and our adversaries are working ever closer together, Blaise will ensure the U.K. can tackle these challenges head on to keep Britain safe and secure at home and abroad,\u201d said Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who oversees MI6."

      "Trump was also facing private pressure from longtime allies who advocate more isolationist policies and wanted him to stop Israel from taking military action or at least withhold U.S. support for any such operation.",
      "This account of Trump\u2019s thinking leading up to the Israeli operation is based on interviews with five current U.S. officials and two Middle Eastern officials, as well as two people with knowledge of the deliberations, two former U.S officials familiar with the deliberations and a Trump ally. The White House didn\u2019t immediately comment, and the Defense Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "In recent weeks, Israel grew more convinced that the threat posed by Tehran was getting increasingly serious and urgent. And while he had already decided not to stand in Israel\u2019s way, on Thursday, only hours before the strikes began, Trump remained at least publicly hopeful that diplomacy would win the day.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want them going in, because I think it would blow it \u2014 might help it actually, but it also could blow it, but we\u2019ve had very good discussions with Iran,\u201d Trump told reporters at a bill signing ceremony. \u201cI prefer the more friendly path.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the Israelis had already laid much of the groundwork for Trump\u2019s measured change. Trump had hoped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be persuaded not to mount an attack. But over the past week, he came to accept that Israel was determined to neutralize Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities and that the United States would have to lend some military support for defensive purposes, as well as some intelligence support.",
      "After the strikes began Thursday evening, the administration took pains to say it had provided no military assistance to Israel, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also the national security adviser, pointedly omitted any mention of U.S. support for Israel\u2019s operations in a statement. But the administration\u2019s public statements the next day did leave the door open to the United States\u2019 having provided some of the kind of intelligence Israel needed to mount an attack.",
      "Israel was able to conduct its initial strikes mostly with its own intelligence and capabilities \u2014 killing three military leaders and nine top scientists working on nuclear enrichment and destroying several nuclear enrichment sites, Israeli officials have said \u2014 but it also leaned heavily on American intelligence, bunker-buster bombs that were provided this year and air defense systems, some of which were scrambled into the region quickly in recent days.",
      "But Trump still wouldn\u2019t sign off on everything Israel wanted. After the start of their military campaign, the Israelis collected intelligence that could have allowed them to target and kill Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Netanyahu presented the operation to Trump, who opposed the plan altogether and wouldn\u2019t allow the United States to participate, according to two U.S. officials. No Americans had been killed in the conflict, so Trump didn\u2019t believe it would be appropriate to remove Khamenei, the political leader, and recommended against the Israelis\u2019 conducting the operation, the officials said.",
      "On Sunday, he appeared to advocate again for talks over strikes, saying on his social media platform, Truth Social: \u201cIran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal, just like I got India and Pakistan to make. ... Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that\u2019s OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach to Israel\u2019s military campaign started to take form last Sunday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in rural Maryland. By that time, Israeli officials had already begun to share extensive information with U.S. officials about their potential operation. Caine, the Joint Chiefs chairman, briefed Trump and his national security team about the Israeli plans to strike Iran and U.S. options, according to two U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the deliberations.",
      "Those options, the three sources said, included logistical support, like refueling Israeli jet fighters, sharing intelligence and using the American military\u2019s electronic warfare capabilities to help Israel jam enemy weapons and communications. Another option was to provide direct military support to Israel, even having U.S. jets drop munitions in active combat alongside Israeli fighters, for example.",
      "And yet another option, Caine briefed Trump, was to do nothing at all.",
      "Trump has consistently said he wants to extract the United States from foreign conflicts and has sought to use diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and the fighting in Gaza, albeit without success.",
      "But Israel was getting anxious, and it wasn\u2019t convinced that Trump\u2019s plan for peace in the region would work. Netanyahu and his war Cabinet didn\u2019t have faith in the U.S. negotiations with Iran taking place in Oman, despite Washington\u2019s public pronouncements that a deal was close.",
      "For months, the Trump administration has pressed the Israelis not to carry out strikes on Iran and warned that the United States wouldn\u2019t support them if they did.",
      "By the end of last week, the White House\u2019s public tone started to include more support for Israel, and in private it shifted from strong opposition against a widespread military operation to acceptance that it was likely to happen and less resistance to it.",
      "Among the reasons for Trump\u2019s change of heart was the declaration Thursday by the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran was in breach of its nonproliferation requirements. Trump was also concerned by the sense coming from Israel, the United States and the IAEA that Iran had achieved leaps in its nuclear program, and he didn\u2019t want to be the president on whose watch it was able to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "The United States had already been quietly moving some pieces into place to prepare for the Israeli attack. In recent days, U.S. European Command was told some of its P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance planes would be diverted to the Middle East to conduct surveillance.",
      "Then, in remarks that drew little attention last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that more than 20,000 U.S. anti-drone missiles meant for Kyiv had been diverted \u2014 to the Middle East.",
      "Trump and Netanyahu spoke several times in the previous week, but by last Monday, Trump had grown convinced that Israel was going to strike and was starting to put more pieces into place to help support the strike.",
      "Soon after that conversation last Monday, the Pentagon directed European Command to send a Navy destroyer to sit off Israel to help defend it in the likely event of a counterattack from Tehran, joining two more and a carrier strike group already there.",
      "Witkoff had been expected to travel to Muscat for peace talks as late as Friday. With the conflict still active, the U.S. side acknowledged that those talks were off. But it\u2019s not shutting the door to future discussions.",
      "\u201cWhile there will be no meeting Sunday, we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon,\u201d an administration official told news organizations."

      "New polling about Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and elements of his policy agenda shows how his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d push doesn't break down along the same neat partisan lines as some other issues, creating some political vulnerability and some opportunity.",
      "A significant majority of U.S. adults support using vaccines to prevent diseases, including majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents, according to the NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey. And the share of people who believe vaccines are most to blame for chronic health issues is small, two dynamics that are at odds with Kennedy's repeated efforts to cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has long spread misinformation about the safety and effectiveness of childhood vaccines. As health secretary, he recently dismantled the country's premier group of vaccine experts \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's independent committee of vaccine advisers \u2014 and replaced former members with several well-known vaccine skeptics.",
      "The poll results suggest those actions don't resonate with the majority of adults.",
      "But Kennedy's focus on overhauling the nation's intake of  ultraprocessed food \u2014 a key part of his \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda \u2014 is an issue many adults can get behind.",
      "The most popular answer to the poll question about what deserves the most blame for America\u2019s chronic health problems was the food industry, at 35%, followed closely by the choices of individuals, at 32%. Kennedy has also targeted environmental toxins as one of the most urgent health issues in the United States, but 6% of respondents agreed that such toxins were the most important reason behind chronic health problems.",
      "The public is fairly closely divided over its view of Kennedy himself, with a 51% majority viewing him favorably and 48% viewing him unfavorably. The majority of Democrats' view Kennedy \"strongly unfavorably,\" while a slim majority of Republicans view him \"somewhat favorably.\"",
      "Those who identify more with the MAGA movement, as opposed to considering themselves primarily supporters of the Republican Party, are far more likely to have \"strongly favorable\" views of Kennedy.",
      "On vaccines, 49% of adults say they \"strongly support\" using vaccines to prevent diseases, with 31% more saying they \"somewhat support\" it.",
      "Another 13% \"somewhat oppose\" using vaccines to prevent diseases, and 7% oppose it \"strongly.\"",
      "About three-quarters of Democrats \"strongly support\" the use of vaccines (and another 16% somewhat support it) and majorities of Republicans and independents support vaccines either \"strongly\" or \"somewhat.\"",
      "Across ages and genders, the most popular answer was that people \"strongly support\" using vaccines, including majorities of people ages 18 to 29 and those 65 and older, who were kids when illnesses like measles and polio were common.",
      "People between those two groups \u2014 ages 30 to 64 \u2014 were slightly less likely to signal strong support for vaccines, even as a plurality still chose the option.",
      "The survey didn't differentiate between Covid vaccines and routine childhood vaccines, like the measles-mumps-rubella shots.",
      "While Kennedy's vaccine skepticism has been a hallmark of his long career inside and outside Washington, he has also waged war on the food industry and accused producers of ultraprocessed foods, environmental toxins and vaccines of contributing to an epidemic of health problems in America.",
      "The poll data suggests a significant chunk of adults are sympathetic to at least part of that pitch, around the food industry.",
      "Among adults, 35% say the food industry deserves the most blame for chronic health problems in the United States like obesity and heart disease. That factor was narrowly the top pick of respondents ahead of \"the choices of individuals,\" which 32% of people chose as deserving the most blame for chronic health problems.",
      "Socioeconomic status (12%) and health insurance companies (10%) were the only other choices of the seven provided that drew double-digit support. Environmental toxins were the top pick of 6%, another 3% chose vaccines, and 2% chose genetics.",
      "Younger adults, a segment of the population that typically leans more liberal, were likelier to choose the food industry as most to blame, while older adults were likelier to choose \"the choices of individuals.\"",
      "And the concept that socioeconomic status is most to blame for chronic health issues appears to be resonating on the left and not the right. While 30% of progressives chose it, as did 14% of those who see themselves as more aligned with the Democratic Party, only small shares of Republicans agreed.",

      "The vast majority of American adults believe the Trump administration must comply with federal court orders, though the president\u2019s strongest supporters are split over the issue, according to a new NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey.",
      "In the poll, 81% of U.S. adults say that if a federal court rules that an administration action is illegal, then the administration has to follow its ruling, while 19% say the administration can ignore the ruling and continue its action.",
      "But among people who consider themselves supporters of the MAGA movement, there's a sharper divide. According to the poll, supporters of President Donald Trump are split, 50%-50%, over whether he should comply with federal court orders.",
      "Democrats are almost unanimous on the issue, with 96% saying the administration has to follow court orders. Among independents, 87% say the administration must obey court orders, while 13% say Trump can ignore them.",
      "The issue of whether the White House can ignore rulings from federal courts has come to the fore as the administration carries out executive actions, including its deportation program, at rapid speed.",

Several federal judges, meanwhile, have considered whether to hold executive branch officials in contempt for what one called \"willful disregard\" of judicial orders.",
      "The issue has also arisen in the high-profile case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. He was deported to an El Salvadoran prison in what the government initially called an \"administrative error.\" The case rose to the Supreme Court, which ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" his return. The Trump administration held out against pushing for that for nearly two months before Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States early this month to face federal charges alleging human smuggling.",

      "Republicans are more supportive of the court than Democrats: 75% view it favorably, compared with 34% with favorable views among Democrats.",
      "Yet one key finding is that Americans generally don\u2019t hold strong views of the Supreme Court right now: 11% have strongly favorable opinions, while 12% are strongly unfavorable. The large remainder rates the court \"somewhat\" favorably or unfavorably.",
      "The poll was conducted ahead of the Supreme Court's traditional season for its highest-profile rulings, and it has yet to rule this year on contentious cases like one concerning birthright citizenship, which could affect public opinion of the court.",
      "The court isn't expected to rule on the merits of whether Trump can end birthright citizenship, which has long been considered a clear right under the 14th Amendment, via executive order. Rather, the current case focuses on the power of judges to block presidential policies through nationwide injunctions.",
      "If the court rules in Trump\u2019s favor, district judges would be limited from using nationwide injunctions to temporarily block an administration policy. There have been at least 39 such rulings during Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last month that he has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for the Supreme Court.",

      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Vance Boelter's capture at a news conference after saying Saturday that the suspect's alleged crimes included a \"politically motivated assassination.\" Despite being armed, authorities said, Boelter was taken into custody without incident and no injuries were reported.",
      "Boelter is in custody and has been charged in connection with the murders and the attempted murders, Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said at the news conference.",
      "Evans added that his team was in contact with the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office, who he said were examining whether to bring their own additional charges.",
      "Nearly 200 law enforcement officers\u2014including members of 20 regional and local SWAT teams\u2014descended on eastern Sibley County, about an hour outside Minneapolis, starting Sunday morning. However, the suspect may have taken advantage of rural terrain to remain hidden most of the day, authorities said.",
      "Police Chief Mark Bruley of the Brooklyn Park Police Department said it was without a doubt the biggest manhunt in the state's history.",
      "The governor expressed relief that the suspect had been apprehended after collaborations from federal, state and local law enforcement concluded when Minnesota State Patrol officers put their handcuffs on him.",
      "Sleepless nights",
      "\"After a two-day manhunt, two sleepless nights, law enforcement have apprehended\" the alleged shooter, Walz said.",
      "\"This cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,\" he added.",
      "Authorities allege Boelter tried to kill state Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin at roughly 2 a.m. Saturday before fatally shooting state Rep. Melissa Hortman, a 55-year-old Democrat, and her husband, Mark, in nearby Brooklyn Park.",
      "In a statement released by the Hoffman family, Yvette Hoffman thanked law enforcement for capturing the suspect.",
      "\"John and I are both incredibly lucky to be alive,\" the statement read. \"We continue our healing journey and are humbled by the outpouring of love and support our family has received from across the state and our nation.\"",
      "Authorities said Boelter left behind a notebook with a hit list of other politicians as well as those who have been vocal in support of abortion rights. The names included those of Hoffman and Hortman near the top, said Democratic Party executive Ron Harris, a fellow Minnesotan.",
      "Evans said the list also included politicians based in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Nebraska and Iowa.",
      "Boelter emerged as the suspect as police covered locations familiar to him and spoke to people associated with the married 57-year-old.",
      "The hunt was jolted into renewed action about 6:30 a.m. Sunday, when his car and cowboy hat were found not far from his residence in Green Isle in the eastern portion of Sibley County, authorities said.",
      "A Buick Regal associated with the suspect, as well as his cowboy hat, found at the side of a road in a wooded area about three miles from the residence, drew a massive manhunt, authorities said.",
      "Tense 10 hours",
      "But the trail seemed to get cold through nightfall as there was no sign of the suspect for more than 10 hours despite evidence he had spoken to people while on the run, Evans, the criminal apprehension superintendent, said at a news conference earlier in the day.",
      "Boelter remained somewhat of a mystery even as authorities spoke to his wife and relatives after a Sunday traffic stop, during which they cooperated fully with investigators, Evans said.",
      "There was no evidence, he said, that the suspect had ever previously threatened the lawmakers he shot or anyone else on that list.",
      "Warrants for his arrest included a state warrant alleging he committed second-degree murder and a federal warrant alleging he was on the run to avoid prosecution. It wasn't clear if the suspect had a lawyer.",
      "Boelter impersonated law enforcement to get close to the lawmakers at their suburban Twin Cities homes before opening fire, officials said.",
      "Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, police conducting a welfare check at the Hortmans' residence encountered a man in front they believe is Boelter, dressed as a police officer, with a police-style SUV, emergency lights on, in the driveway, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said on Saturday.",
      "It was apparent the home had taken fire before the officers' arrival, he said, and when the suspect realized police had arrived, he opened fire and exchanged rounds with them before fleeing through the home and escaping out back, he said.",
      "No other injuries were reported, but inside that home was the slain couple, authorities said.",
      "A statement of probable cause filed in support of charges reflected in the state warrant stated the suspect was seen on security video earlier at Hoffman's home, shortly after 2 a.m., presenting himself at their door as a police officer, wearing a mask over his face, and using a Ford SUV that had the appearance of a marked patrol vehicle.",
      "The couple's daughter was not struck and called 911. Walz cited his daughter, Hope, as he spoke Sunday night, calling her actions \"heroic.\"",
      "Authorities said they found three semiautomatic rifles and two 9mm handguns in the abandoned SUV. Also inside, they said, was the notebook with the alleged hit list.",
      "At the news conference, Evans said a local police officer reported seeing a man running into the woods, and authorities, including SWAT teams and a state public safety helicopter overhead, rushed the area. They called for the suspect to surrender and captured him as he crawled through a field, he said.",
      "Detectives were interviewing the suspect overnight, Evans said.",
      "In a video circulating online, the suspect describes himself as a married father of five from Green Isle who works for two funeral homes. He said he had previously worked for three decades in the food industry and once traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo to partner with farmers and fishermen to help them stimulate their food supply system.",

    "story": [
      "BOSTON \u2014 The Boston Red Sox traded Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants on Sunday in a deal that could shake up pennant races on both coasts.",
      "Devers\u2019 agent, Nelson Montes de Oca, confirmed the deal to The Associated Press. ESPN reported that the Giants are sending Boston a package of players that includes pitchers Jordan Hicks and Kyle Harrison for the 28-year-old designated hitter, who had bristled at his demotion from third base this year.",
      "The Giants were one game behind the first-place Los Angeles Dodgers heading into Sunday night\u2019s matchup between the NL West rivals. San Francisco shortstop Willy Adames said on the ESPN broadcast that the team found out about the trade 15-20 minutes before the game.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s so excited,\u201d he said in an on-field interview while playing the field in the second inning. \u201cMe, personally, I\u2019m like thrilled to have him on the team. He\u2019s one of the best hitters in the game, and to have him on the team, I think is going to help us do a lot of damage in the division. Obviously we need a bat like him in this lineup.\u201d",
      "A three-time All-Star who signed a 10-year, $313.5 million contract with the Red Sox in 2023, Devers is batting .272 with 15 homers and 58 RBIs in 73 games, including a solo shot in Boston\u2019s 2-0 victory over the New York Yankees on Sunday that completed a three-game sweep.",
      "But his relationship with the team began to deteriorate when the team signed Gold Glove third baseman Alex Bregman during spring training and asked Devers to move to DH; he balked before agreeing to the switch. When first baseman Triston Casas sustained a season-ending knee injury, the Red Sox approached Devers about playing the field and he declined, saying the front office \u201cshould do their jobs\u201d and look for another player.",
      "A day after Devers\u2019 comments to the media about playing first, Red Sox owner John Henry, team president Sam Kennedy and chief baseball officer Craig Breslow flew to Kansas City to meet with Devers and manager Alex Cora.",
      "The situation became more difficult when Bregman sustained what the team called a significant right quadriceps injury on May 23.",
      "\u201cEverybody around the league, I think, was paying attention to that. When any team is having some kind of drama like that, with a player like Devers \u2014 he basically was the face of the franchise,\u201d Adames said before he was interrupted by Tommy Edman\u2019s home run that gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have him. Everybody\u2019s excited. So we\u2019re going to make him feel at home,\u201d Adames said. \u201cI feel like it sends a message that we\u2019re going to compete. That we\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to come over here and win the division.\u201d",
      "The Red Sox have won five out of six against the rival Yankees over the last two weekends to improve to 37-36, but they are still fourth in the AL East, 6 1/2 games behind division-leading New York.",
      "Devers was 20 when he made his major league debut with the Red Sox in 2017. He helped the Red Sox win the 2018 World Series and led the team in RBIs for five consecutive seasons from 2020-24. He has finished in the top 20 in voting for AL MVP five times.",
      "Devers is not the first Red Sox All-Star to be traded away: The team sent Mookie Betts to the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 2020 season in a salary dump \u2014 just a year after he won the AL MVP award and led Boston to a franchise-record 108 wins and its fourth World Series title since 2004.",
      "But the Devers deal is perhaps most reminiscent of the 2004 midseason shakeup when Boston traded disgruntled shortstop \u2014 and fan favorite \u2014 Nomar Garciaparra to Minnesota.",
      "The Red Sox went on to win the World Series that year, ending their 86-year championship drought.",
      "This is the latest big move by Buster Posey, a seven-time All-Star who took over as San Francisco\u2019s president of baseball operations in September. He signed Justin Verlander to a $15 million, one-year contract in January and Adames to a $182 million, seven-year deal in December.",
      "\u201cIt makes them better right now, for sure,\u201d Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw said in a TV interview from the dugout at Dodger Stadium. \u201cBuster Posey\u2019s really doing it. Good for Buster over there. He\u2019s going for it. I\u2019d consider Raffy one of the top 10 hitters in the game, at worst. He\u2019s definitely a game-changer. It will be interesting to see what position he plays over there.\u201d"

      "First came his driver on the 314-yard 17th hole onto the green for a birdie that gave him the lead. Needing two putts from 65 feet on the 18th to win, he finished this storybook week by holing the longest putt all week for birdie and a 2-over 72.",
      "That made him the only player to finish under par at 1-under 279. It gave him a two-shot victory over Robert MacIntyre of Scotland.",

      "The rain that put Oakmont on the edge of being unplayable might have saved Spaun. One shot behind at the start of the day, he opened with five bogeys in six holes. And then came a rain delay of 1 hour, 37 minutes.",
      "Spaun recovered as so many others fell apart."

McLaren\u2019s teammates Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris engaged in a fierce battle, culminating in Norris\u2019 crashing out after a failed overtake attempt on the start-finish straight.",

The fight wasn't over as Norris got a better exit and went for the overtake \u2014 but he ran out of road, slipped onto the grass and crashed out after he hit the wall. Over the team radio, he was quick to take full responsibility for the incident.",
      "\u201cI should never have gone for it, I guess, is my complete hindsight thing. I thought he was starting to drift a little bit to the right, so I thought I had a small opportunity to go to the left,\u201d Norris told reporters after the race. \u201cBut it was way too much risk, especially on my teammate.\u201d",

      "The result in Canada will fuel questions about Norris and his tendency to make mistakes in clutch moments. Still, the title race is far from over: This was the 10th Grand Prix of the 2025 season. There are 14 more races to go.",
      "\u201cPlenty more races left,\u201d Norris said when he was asked about his championship hopes. \u201cI don\u2019t expect it to be easy. I don\u2019t expect to catch him easily. But I have to work hard for it and make less mistakes than I made this weekend.\u201d",
      "There is bad blood between Russell and Verstappen, who qualified first and second, respectively, for a highly anticipated start.",
      "Russell got the better jump and led away, but Verstappen stayed close and sought to attack him in the first few laps. But he couldn\u2019t get past in the first stint, and Verstappen, the defending four-time world champion, ended up having to fend off Antonelli. Verstappen tried to attack again in the final stretch, but Russell increased his pace and kept his rival behind.",

      "It was the first time all year that both McLaren drivers failed to make the podium. Piastri started in third place but fell into the clutches of a faster Norris in the closing stretch. Norris qualified poorly in seventh place but gambled on a different tire strategy that helped him gain positions.",
      "Charles Leclerc of Ferrari finished fifth, while teammate Lewis Hamilton finished a disappointing sixth, struggling with car damage throughout the race.",
      "Hamilton said he learned afterward that he hit a groundhog. In the moment, \"I didn't know what it was. I just felt something,\" Hamilton told reporters.",
      "Aston Martin\u2019s Fernando Alonso, who finished seventh, delivered a standout radio moment of the day. When his race engineer asked him to ease off when he entered certain corners to preserve his tires, Alonso, a two-time world champion, clapped back.",
      "\u201cWe are racing. Not testing,\u201d he replied.",
      "Verstappen, who was under the cloud of a potential one-race ban if he incurred penalty points in Montreal, bristled at questions about it. He insisted he wouldn\u2019t adjust his driving style, and he showed his irritation Saturday when he was asked about the prospect during the weekend.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t need to hear it again. It\u2019s really pissing me off,\u201d he said after qualifying. \u201cIt\u2019s such a waste of time. It\u2019s very childish. So that\u2019s why I also don\u2019t want to say too much, because it\u2019s really annoying, this world that we live in.\u201d",

      "Law enforcement, including state troopers, set up a staging area Sunday about 3 miles from Boelter's Green Isle home. Video showed armed state troopers in the area, about 50 miles west-southwest of Minneapolis.",
      "Referring to residents in and near the search zone after 10 hours of looking for Boelter there, Nienaber said, \"I don't believe they should be scared, but I think they should be vigilant.\"",

      "He told locals, \"We are doing the best that we can.\"",
      "He's married with five children",
      "State Public Safety Commissioner Bob Jacobson identified Boelter, 57, as the suspect, describing him as 6-foot-1 with brown hair, wearing a light-colored cowboy hat and a dark long-sleeve collared shirt or coat. Jacobson urged people not to approach Boelter if they see him, adding that he is \"armed and dangerous.\" At a news briefing Saturday, Gov. Tim Walz said the shootings were \"politically motivated.\"",
      "According to a video circulating online, Boelter is married and a father of five children. The Mille Lacs County Sheriff\u2019s Office stopped his wife, who hasn\u2019t been identified, in Onamia on Saturday morning as part of a perimeter stop. \"Several other relatives\" were in the car, the sheriff's office said, and no one in the vehicle was questioned or searched.",
      "Evans, of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said the suspect's wife and other relatives have been \"very cooperative\" and provided information sought by investigators.",
      "Authorities aren\u2019t ruling out the possibility the suspect had help planning or executing the shootings, Evans said, but so far no evidence has emerged that he did.",

      "\"I have been in several countries where people don't have the ability to vote for who their leaders are,\" he wrote. \"So I am very big on just telling people to be a part of the process and vote your values and be part of this adventure we are all a part of living in the United States of America.\"",
      "He spoke at church sermons",
      "Boelter delivered church sermons in the DRC in 2021, 2022 and 2023, according to livestreams posted on Facebook authenticated by NBC News. In a 2021 speech, he began with a prayer and then spoke about his path to becoming a better Christian.",
      "Boelter recounted working in a vegetable-canning factory at age 17 with a co-worker who \"talked about God all the time,\" ultimately inspiring him to take his religion more seriously.",
      "At one point during his testimony, Boelter dropped to his knees as he described the moment he dedicated his life to Jesus.",
      "\"And I said, 'I'm so sorry, forgive me, God, for living for myself and not for you,'\" he said. \"And I said, 'Jesus, if you forgive me of my sin and save me, I'll live for you for the rest of my life.'\"",
      "He worked for two funeral homes",
      "In a r\u00e9sum\u00e9-style video circulating online, Boelter introduces himself as a married father of five from Green Isle, Minnesota, who works for two funeral homes, Wulff Funeral Home and Metro First Call, handling what he calls \"removals.\"",
      "\u201cFun fact about myself: I\u2019ve been in the food industry about 30 years, and that led to an opportunity. I was invited to the Democratic Republic of Congo,\u201d he says in the video, adding that he worked with Del Monte Foods and Minnesota-based chicken producer Gold\u2019n Plump.",
      "Boelter says he left the food industry because his company \u201cwasn\u2019t interested in doing anything in Africa.\u201d He says he then transitioned to the funeral home business while he pursued projects in Africa on his own.",
      "Boelter mentions in the video that he was taking a course to learn more about the funeral industry, indicating it may have been recorded for the class. The timing of the video, recorded using the screen-recording software Screenpal, remains unclear.",
      "In a statement, Tim Koch, the owner of Metro First Call, said Boelter worked for the company from August 2023 until he \"voluntarily left\" this February.",
      "\"To say anything more at this time would be irresponsible as the investigation continues,\" Koch said.",
      "'A loving, caring guy'",
      "Boelter's roommate, who wasn\u2019t identified, spoke to KARE about him.",
      "\"I mean, he was a loving, caring guy, you know,\" the man told the station. \"Loved his family, loved his friends and loved God, and I don\u2019t know why he did what he did. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s not Vance. No one will believe this.\"",
      "The roommate said he got a final message from Boelter around 6 a.m. Saturday in which he said he \"may be dead shortly.\"",
      "\"So, I just want to let you know that I love you guys both, and I wish it hadn\u2019t gone this way,\" read the text, read by Boelter's tearful roommate. \"I don\u2019t want to say anything more and implicate you in any way, because you guys don\u2019t know anything about this. But I love you guys, and I\u2019m sorry for all the trouble this has caused.\"",
      "It wasn\u2019t clear whether the roommate lived with Boelter and his family or whether he had been living separately from his family with the roommate.",
      "On Saturday, several vehicles drove past the boarded-up house to get a glimpse of where Boelter often stayed. Neighbors went about their routines \u2014 one barbecuing for her children, while another was mowing his lawn.",
      "But living near a suspect wanted in a murder case has already taken its toll.",
      "\"I\u2019m terrified, yes, I\u2019m scared,\" said Kameko White, 33, who lives directly across the street from where Boelter sometimes resided. \"I have a killer who lives across the street.\"",
      "White said she was trying to process the shooting, having seen Boelter days earlier, smoking a cigarette.",
      "\"He clearly snapped and he\u2019s on the run,\" White said.",
      "Anyone who sees Boelter is encouraged to call 911. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information that leads to his arrest."

    "published": "Sun, 15 Jun 2025 17:11:39 GMT",
    "summary": "With falling ticket prices and protests from MLS players ahead of the tournament, buy-in from fans and players has taken the spotlight.",
    "story": [
      "The debate that roiled soccer fans for generations was also its most unanswerable: Which clubs, on which continents, played the best soccer?",
      "Unlike national teams that played one another in the quadrennial World Cup, there was rarely overlap between the top teams in Europe and South America or North America except for summertime \u201cfriendly\u201d competitions.",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup, which begins this weekend across the United States and runs through the final on July 13, expanded its previously smaller format in an attempt to provide an answer. It now features 32 teams, from six continents, playing for a total prize money pool of $1 billion.",
      "\u201cThis is for bragging rights,\u201d said Jill Ellis, the chief football officer of FIFA, soccer\u2019s global governing body, and a former World Cup-winning coach of the U.S. women\u2019s national team. \u201cPrize money is a part of it. But most importantly, this is a chance to be the first-ever club world champion.\u201d",
      "As the tournament opens, however, the money is more than just a small part of it. Falling ticket prices and accusations from Major League Soccer players that the league had agreed to participate in a \u201ccash grab\u201d that unfairly compensates them have raised the question of just how much buy-in the new tournament has from U.S. audiences and players.",
      "When tickets for Saturday\u2019s opening game in Florida between Inter Miami, featuring Lionel Messi, and Egyptian side Al Ahly went on sale in December through Ticketmaster, an upper-deck ticket cost $379. Last week, similar tickets were on sale for as low as $116. According to NPR, FIFA has worked with a Florida college to offer four complimentary tickets for students who pay for single $20 tickets. Attendance for the opening game was announced at 60,927, slightly shy of the stadium's capacity of 65,000.",
      "Bayern Munich, the perennial German champion, listed lower-bowl tickets for its opener Sunday in Cincinnati for as low as $107 when its tickets went on sale in December; on Saturday, tickets were being resold on StubHub for half that.",
      "For as little as $8, fans can watch a June 25 game between Japan's Urawa Red Diamonds and Mexican side C.F. Monterrey.",
      "\"We anticipate great attendances and electric atmospheres at its inaugural edition, with excitement growing with every round of matches and the tournament ultimately standing as the undisputed pinnacle of club world football,\" FIFA said in a statement. \"The appetite speaks for itself: fans from over 130 countries have already purchased tickets. The top 10 markets are led by the United States, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Canada, France, Japan, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal \u2014 a clear sign of global anticipation and reach.\"",
      "As a new tournament, the Club World Cup can't offer much in the way of prestige or history. Instead, it has offered a historic amount of prize money, with $525 million of the total $1 billion distributed to teams on a sliding scale, guaranteed, just for making the 32-team field. At the top, brand-name European teams such as Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain will earn $12.8 million to $38 million; at the bottom, New Zealand\u2019s Auckland City FC will earn $3.5 million.",
      "Distribution of the remaining $475 million of the billion-dollar pool will be determined by teams\u2019 performances; making the round of 16 earns each club $7.5 million, with quarterfinalists earning $13.1 million and prizes increasing up to the final. The winner can ultimately rake in up to $125 million, all of which adds up to much more than bragging rights \u2014 which has left Major League Soccer players asking why their cut from the windfall isn\u2019t greater.",
      "Before a June 1 match players from the Seattle Sounders donned white T-shirts during warmups that read \u201cClub World Ca$h Grab,\u201d with an image of the Mr. Monopoly character wearing an \u201cMLS\u201d top hat and holding a pouch reading \u201cFIFA.\u201d The protest led the team\u2019s owner to berate players afterward, according to The Seattle Times.",
      "The three teams in the Club World Cup field from Major League Soccer \u2014 Seattle, Inter Miami and Los Angeles FC \u2014 are guaranteed $9.55 million apiece for participating, before any bonuses are earned for performance. Players\u2019 earnings from participation or performance in a \u201ccompulsory tournament or noncompulsory tournament\u201d is capped at $1 million, per the terms of the league\u2019s collective bargaining agreement.",
      "The players\u2019 union has continued to push publicly to increase\u2019 players stake from what is currently about a 90/10 division, and it has noted that before a major tournament last year, the players and MLS renegotiated the prize money distribution before ultimately landing at a 50-50 split.",
      "In a statement Thursday, MLS said it has \u201cagreed to voluntarily provide additional performance-based compensation to players from the three participating clubs.\u201d That proposal, the league said, would allocate 20% of all prize money earned from the group stage onward to players.",
      "\u201cIf an MLS club wins the Club World Cup, its players would collectively receive more than $24 million in performance bonuses,\u201d the statement read. \u201cMLS club owners believe performance-based incentives are appropriate given the expanded format and increased prize pool for the Club World Cup. The League values the continued dedication and commitment of its players and looks forward to supporting them as they represent their clubs \u2014 and Major League Soccer \u2014 on the global stage this summer.\u201d",
      "On June 8, the players association posted on X that it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the league\u2019s proposal.",
      "\u201cThe timing, substance and retaliatory nature of the proposal sends a clear message: MLS does not respect or value players\u2019 efforts with regard to this tournament,\u201d the post read. \u201cAlthough not surprised, the players and the MLSPA are deeply disappointed by this message.\"",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think sitting out is an option,\u201d Seattle midfielder Albert Rusnak told reporters Friday. \u201cJust because, again, that inside what we have as athletes and winners and want to go out there and win and prove the people wrong whether we\u2019re talking about the bonuses or the people not believing we can do anything.\u201d",
      "Ellis, who works for FIFA, believes the prospect of playing on that global stage will lead to strong competition from players.",
      "\u201cI think the U.S. players, if you were to say to anyone, \u2018Do you want to play in this tournament?\u2019 sure. Do they want to be paid as much as probably \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s within their own league and within the MLS to determine that, because obviously, unlike a lot of leagues around the world, MLS has a salary cap,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cSo there\u2019s certain different structures and CBA, and so that\u2019s internal to that.",
      "\u201cBut I think in terms of what I and my experience in working with some of the best players in the world, elite players want to play against elite players. They want to test themselves, prove themselves, and they want to compete. ... Listen, at the end of the day it\u2019s a choice, but I think players will want to play in this event.  ...",
      "\u201cIn American sports when we win, when the Major League Baseball team wins, they\u2019re world champions. When the NFL team [wins] \u2014 the title is world champions. Well, yes, but they\u2019re playing against American teams. This is truly a world championship. This is the best clubs in the world.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "It takes one bad sunburn to realize that sunscreen isn\u2019t always enough. That\u2019s where sun-protective UPF clothing can come in.",
      "\u201cSun-protective clothing adds an extra layer of defense from the sun, and unlike sunscreen, it doesn\u2019t necessarily fade with time,\u201d says Dr. Anna Guanche, FAAD, and founder of Bella Skin Institute.",
      "Since sunscreen needs to be reapplied frequently, and chemical sunscreens must be fully absorbed for 30 minutes before they perform optimally, our experts recommend wearing UPF clothing, including swimwear, as the first line of defense against UV radiation.",
      "Yet not all UPF clothing is created the same, says Marc Hurlbert, Ph.D., and CEO of the Melanoma Research Alliance. \u201cHigh-quality UPF clothing achieves its sun protection through the fabrics or weaves used to create it and is designed to last the full lifetime of the article of clothing,\u201d he explains, adding that \u201clower-quality UPF clothing uses a chemical add-on that may become less effective as you wear and wash it.\u201d",
      "To understand how UPF works and what determines its quality rating, we spoke to dermatologists about what to look for when shopping for clothing and swimwear. We also rounded up some top-rated pieces to buy for men, women and kids based on their advice.",

      "What is UPF?",
      "UPF stands for ultraviolet protection factor and measures a product\u2019s ability to block sunlight. It\u2019s assigned to clothing and accessories, like UPF hats, by how well it keeps out both UVA and UVB rays. \u201cWith UPF, use the number as a denominator. So a UPF of 50 means it will allow only 1/50th of the sun\u2019s rays to penetrate the clothing,\u201d says Dr. Charles Crutchfield III, a clinical professor of dermatology at the University of Minnesota Medical School. \u201cThe bigger the number, the better, but most UPF products stop at 50.\u201d",
      "The Skin Cancer Foundation requires clothing to have a UPF rating of 30 or higher to be considered \u201csun protective.\u201d A UPF of 30 to 49 is considered \u201cvery good\u201d protection, and a UPF of 50+ provides \u201cexcellent protection,\u201d says Guanche.",
      "How we picked the best UPF clothing and swimwear",
      "While The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends a UPF rating of at least 30, we chose to look only at swimwear that had a UPF rating of 50+. Our experts also recommended we look for pieces with the following:",
      "A tight weave, since denser material permits less UV rays to pass through. Dark colors, which deflect rays better than light colors.Materials like polyester, nylon or lightweight satin silks that deflect UV raysQuick-drying materials, since studies show that UPF can be less effective when wet.",

      "How to shop for quality UPF clothing and swimwear",
      "The best way to know if a garment is safe and effective at blocking harmful UV rays is to look for the The Skin Cancer Foundation\u2019s Seal of Recommendation, according to experts. The foundation grants this seal to fabrics that have a minimum of 30 UPF on the lightest shade in its product range and also pass a number of tests by the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists.",
      "Our experts also recommend looking for the following:",
      "UPF 30-50+ rating: Although The Skin Cancer Foundation accepts a minimum of UPF 30, the most optimal level of protection is 50+, says Hurlbert. A UPF rating of 30 means the fabric allows 1/30th, or about 3% of UV radiation to pass through. A garment rated UPF 50 permits only 1/50th, or about 2% of UV transmission. Any fabric that permits less than 2% is labeled UPF 50+.",
      "Looser fit: Despite what you might think, a looser-fitting garment is more effective at protecting you from the sun, because tighter-fitting material stretches the fabric, allowing more sun in, said Tareen.",
      "Full coverage: To maximize sun protection, our experts advise shopping for garments that cover more of your body, like long sleeves, high collars and extendable cuffs.",
      "Tight weave: The denser the fabric, the better it blocks the rays, says Tareen. For a quick visual check, Tareen recommends holding the garment up to the sunlight to gauge its transparency.",
      "Dark or bright colors: The more intense the hue, the better the protection the clothing will provide,\u201d says The Skin Cancer Foundation. Dark or bright colors, including red, black and navy blue, absorb more UV rays than lighter colors, like whites and pastels, according to the foundation.",
      "Type of material: Different types of material matter as well, according to Dr. Naiara Braghiroli, a dermatologist at the Baptist Health Miami Cancer Institute. For instance, unbleached cotton, rayon, flax and hemp all consist of natural fibers that absorb UV rays, while shiny polyester, nylon or lightweight satin silks deflect the rays and are considered more protective, she says.",
      "Quick-drying fabrics: UV protection appears to be less effective when clothes are wet, according to a study conducted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, so it\u2019s best to invest in a quick-drying material treated with UPF, such as polyester and nylon, say experts.",
      "What other ways can you protect yourself from the sun\u2019s rays?",
      "UPF clothing is the first line of defense against the sun\u2019s harmful rays, says experts. Here are a few other things they recommend you consider when heading outside in the warmer months.",
      "Seek out shade: \u201cThis is especially important between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when UV rays are strongest,\u201d says Hurlbert.",
      "Wear a hat: Hats with a wide brim are preferable so your neck and ears are covered, says Hurlbert. Like swimwear, the best hats should have a UPF rating of 50+, made of a material that is quick-drying and deflects UV rays.",
      "Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes and the delicate skin that surrounds them, says Hurlbert.",

      "Talk to any dermatologist and they\u2019ll probably tell you three things about skin care: never sleep in your makeup (aka wash your face every single night), moisturize your skin (even if it\u2019s oily) and, by all means, wear sunscreen.",
      "If a good daily SPF isn\u2019t already part of your skin care routine, that\u2019s a problem. Sunscreen isn\u2019t just a health essential (it helps prevent skin cancer); it also has aesthetic benefits (like warding off premature wrinkles and sun spots). Wearing sunscreen daily \u201cis truly the single most impactful step anyone can take for their skin health,\u201d says Dr. Shuting Hu, cosmetic chemist, skin biologist and Acaderma founder. Everyone, regardless of their skin tone or type, should wear it daily. \u201cUnless you live in a dark cave, you need sunscreen protection,\u201d says Ginger King, a cosmetic chemist.",
      "That said, sunscreens aren\u2019t known for having cosmetically elegant formulas and haven\u2019t always had the best reputation. Many are infamous for strong smells, thick white casts, pore-clogging ingredients and that signature sting. Add in an oversaturated market, and finding one you\u2019ll actually use every day can feel overwhelming.",
      "That\u2019s where we come in. Ahead of summer, we set out to find the absolute best SPF face formulas on the market. (Though, yes, you should be wearing sunscreen daily, regardless of the season, even if you\u2019re indoors).",

      "How we chose our contenders",
      "We could have tested upward of 500 sunscreens \u2014 probably even more, given the crowded nature of the sunscreen market. In actuality, we ended up testing just more than 110 formulas and ranked them accordingly. Here\u2019s how we got there:",
      "Our team has written extensively about sunscreen in the past (see our guides to the best K-beauty sunscreens, best sunscreens for dark skin tones and best sunscreens for sensitive skin to name a few). To build our final testing list, we sorted through our previous coverage looking for brands that appeared repeatedly, as well as any direct recommendations from experts, including dermatologists and cosmetic chemists familiar with sunscreen.",
      "Additionally, we polled our team about the formulas they already use and love, as well as any new options they were interested in trying. We also spent weeks researching top-selling contenders. If a formula generated online attention (in a good or bad way), we added it to the testing list so we could assess it for ourselves.",
      "Constraints were also important to us. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of SPF formulas on the market right now. There are sport sunscreens, scalp sunscreens, moisturizers with SPF, tinted moisturizers, tinted sunscreens, BB creams, CC creams, spray sunscreens, sunscreen sticks, reef-safe sunscreens, kids sunscreens, lip sunscreens \u2014 I could go on.",
      "We focused exclusively on face sunscreens and excluded any that were explicitly intended for the body, although we do have some dual-formula products. We didn\u2019t include any sprays because they\u2019re generally prone to misapplication and are best as body sunscreens.",
      "Most importantly, we excluded any products where sun protection wasn\u2019t the priority. That meant we ruled out moisturizers (tinted or not), BB creams, CC creams and other formulas that merely have SPF in them.",
      "And finally, we only tested formulas with an SPF of 30 or higher (most of which provided broad-spectrum protection), as recommended by the American Academy of Dermatology Association (AAD). We tested both chemical and mineral formulas, including drugstore options as well as higher-priced options, although we excluded formulas from luxury brands, such as Chanel and La Mer. We ruled out any formulas that cost more than $100.",
      "What we considered",
      "All of our editors have different skin types, tones and textures. Some of our team members run on the oily side and need matte formulas, some prefer serum-y, almost invisible-like feels, some endure high-intensity workouts daily and need sweat-resistant formulas, and some (if not most) of our editors dislike mineral formulas. To maintain consistency across different personal preferences, every editor was required to answer the same 14 questions for each formula they tested, in addition to providing commentary. The questions touched on:",
      "Blendability: Did it blend in well? Were there blotches? Did it pill? How quickly does it blend in, or does it require minutes of rubbing? We gave more points to clump-free formulas that are easily blendable. White cast: Put simply, did it leave one? And if so, did it go away after rubbing it in?Wear over time: We awarded more points to formulas that didn\u2019t change consistency or result in oiliness throughout the day. If it was immediately oily or clumpy, we deducted points.Layerability: Many members of our team wear makeup over SPF. We assessed how every formula sat on our skin under other products. Many led to pilling, clumping or otherwise strange appearances of other beauty products like concealer or blush over top. Tolerability: We have a diverse staff, all with different skin concerns. We assessed whether a given formula made us break out or otherwise irritated our skin. Scent: Did it smell like the sunscreen (in a bad way)? Was there added fragrance? We gave fewer points to formulas that had a distinct odor.Feel: Stinging upon application resulted in a poor score. We also awarded more points to formulas that didn\u2019t leave our hands sticky.Consistency: A balanced formula (particularly as it pertains to shininess and thickness) was the goal. We gave fewer points to formulas that were watery or oily and more to formulas that came out without clumps. We also deducted points if the formula skewed too shiny or matte in one direction \u2014 the best formulas, to us, were ones that had equilibrium. We also considered how the formula was presented initially without having to shake the bottle. The brands that ranked the highest on our list had the most stable, consistent formulas.Packaging: We assessed every bottle or stick for liquid control and ease of storage. To do so, we considered whether the cap or lid stayed put and how much of the formula came out at once. Price and rebuy factor: Most brands sent us these formulas as samples for testing. Despite this, we considered the overall cost of each formula and whether we\u2019d rebuy these and, if so, under what circumstances: at full price, with a discount or with a gift card.",

      "Methodology",
      "Ultimately, our team tested over 110 formulas during a six-week period. At least two editors tried every product, though in many cases, more than that tested a formula. In doing so, every editor used each SPF for at least three days and then assigned a maximum of five points per question based on the above criteria as well as provided qualitative commentary. The higher the score, the better the product performed in our ranking.",
      "After forming an initial rank based on the raw data, we adjusted the placement of certain formulas after assessing our editors\u2019 feedback as well as considering the product\u2019s price point and availability. We also considered the AAD\u2019s recommendations for water-resistant, broad-spectrum sunscreens with a minimum SPF of 30. Not every sunscreen in our top 20 has all three of those guidance factors since we prioritized finding options that were genuinely wearable every day no matter the circumstance. Our intention was not to create a summer-activities-focused list, so factors like water resistance were less important to us compared to whether a formula irritated our skin or left a white cast.",
      "We also tried to include as many brands as possible, with some like Sun Bum, EltaMD, La Roche-Posay appearing multiple times because they produce so many SKUs. That said, just because we tested a formula does not guarantee it a spot.",

Since it\u2019s so hydrating, you run the risk of being on the shinier side, but, given the price and the fact that a little does go a long way, I can overlook the occasional greasiness.

It\u2019s now my favorite sunscreen for summer days in the park and for workouts, because of how well it holds up against sweat.

      "This was the third sunscreen I tried during the testing process and for the remaining five weeks I just kept wishing I could return to it. One of the first indications as to whether I\u2019m going to like a sunscreen is how it feels on my hands. This sunscreen came out in a unified creamy consistency without me having to shake the bottle, so I was initially pretty impressed. Many of the other formulas I tested were watery or clumpy at first squeeze. Another important factor for me is odor; I don\u2019t want to smell like a kid whose parent forcibly lathered sunscreen all over. At first sniff there\u2019s a faint earthy smell but it disappears when I rub it in.",
      "As someone with sensitive skin who leans on the drier side, my favorite thing about the Round Lab formula is that it\u2019s genuinely soothing and feels like I\u2019m wearing a thin layer of hydration on my skin \u2014 so much so, that I didn\u2019t have to layer on my regular moisturizer. My skin consistently feels nourished and hydrated whenever I apply this and after a few days of consecutive use I noticed my skin was more plump and also less irritated.",
      "Crucially: It doesn\u2019t leave behind a greasy residue or make my face feel too shiny. And best of all \u2014 no white cast. We had many editors with different skin tones test this and we all agree it blends in beautifully.",
      "You don\u2019t know what makes a good sunscreen until you try a bunch of them, so I can confidently say that the Round Lab Birch Juice Sunscreen is as close to perfect as a face sunscreen can get \u2014 and I will be recommending it to anyone who will listen. - Rodriguez",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "SPF (sun protection factor) measures how much UV radiation is required to produce a sunburn on protected skin compared to the amount of UV radiation required to produce sunburn on unprotected skin, according to the FDA. It is not a measure of time. For example, SPF 45 does not mean you can sit in the sun for 45 minutes without getting burned. What it does mean is that if you apply an SPF 45 properly, it would take you 45 times longer to burn than if you didn\u2019t use sunscreen, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation.",
      "An estimated one in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime, according to the AAD. One way to prevent that is by wearing sunscreen daily. \u201cDaily sunscreen isn\u2019t just a beauty tip, it\u2019s fundamental preventive medicine for your skin, crucial for both its long-term health and appearance,\u201d says Hu. It also helps prevent premature wrinkles and age spots, caused by unprotected UV exposure, according to the AAD. Plus, it can also help reduce the worsening of skin conditions like hyperpigmentation, rosacea and melasma, according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Nkem Ugonabo.",
      "Wearing sunscreen daily is ultimately \u201cabout safeguarding your skin from the constant, cumulative damage of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is present every single day of the year, rain or shine, indoors or out,\u201d says Hu. That\u2019s why everyone six months and older should wear it. \u201cThe damage from chronic sun exposure is cumulative so the earlier people can start with sun protection the better they will be down the road,\u201d says board-certified dermatologist Dr. William Huang.",
      "Despite the vast array of choices available, selecting a face sunscreen is actually quite simple if you follow the AAD\u2019s recommendations. To do so, look for a formula with:",
      "Broad-spectrum protection: This refers to whether a formula protects against both UVA rays (the kind that age your skin) and UVB rays (the kind that burn your skin and cause cancer). Not all sunscreens protect against both, so it\u2019s crucial to check.SPF 30 or higher: An SPF 30 formula will block up to 97% of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet B (UVB) rays. While you can technically go higher, the added protection is minimal and no sunscreen will block 100% of the sun\u2019s rays.Water resistance: Do not fall for marketing that suggests a product is waterproof or sweatproof \u2014 there\u2019s no such thing. A sunscreen\u2019s label will indicate whether it\u2019s water-resistant, and if so, how long. They typically remain effective for 40 or 80 minutes, according to the FDA.",

      "The most effective sunscreens will be the ones that you apply directly onto the skin, typically in the form of lotions, sticks, creams and gels. That\u2019s because it\u2019s easier to regulate how much you\u2019re actually applying, according to our experts.",
      "You should always apply your face SPF liberally and evenly across the forehead, cheeks, nose and chin at least 15 minutes before sun exposure, according to experts. \u201cAn easy rule to follow is to apply a line of sunscreen along the entire length of your middle and index fingers, and then apply that amount to the full face,\u201d says Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital.",
      "Firstly, you should never rely on the SPF in your makeup \u2014 whether it be foundation or daily moisturizer \u2014 to protect your skin from the sun, according to Dr. Brendan Camp, a double board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery. That\u2019s because the SPF in makeup is diluted, and you\u2019d need to apply an unrealistic amount to get the labeled protection, says Catie Boucher, FNP-C, DCNP, a board-certified dermatology nurse practitioner and founder of SavvyDerm. Reapplying makeup every two hours also isn\u2019t practical. When in doubt, keep this motto in mind: \u201cYour sunscreen can double as makeup, but your makeup can\u2019t double as SPF,\u201d says Boucher.",
      "As for where your SPF should come in your skin care routine, all the dermatologists I spoke to recommend wearing sunscreen underneath makeup \u2014 as your last step before applying anything else. \u201cSunscreen needs to form a uniform protective layer directly on your skin to e\ufb00ectively absorb or reflect UV rays,\u201d says Hu. \u201cApplying it underneath your makeup ensures this thin layer is established without interference from other products. If applied over makeup, it won\u2019t adhere evenly and its protective capabilities will be compromised.\u201d",
      "Simply put: You should reapply your face sunscreen every two hours when outdoors \u2014 even on cloudy days. When using a water-resistant sunscreen, be sure to reapply it after any contact with water \u2014 i.e. via swimming or sweating, according to the AAD.",
      "If you\u2019re using a tinted sunscreen, which is more difficult to reapply, you should still abide by the two-hour rule, unless you\u2019re not spending much time outdoors and/or are not directly exposed to the sun for long periods, according to experts in our guide to tinted sunscreen. If you end up sweating, swimming or spending time outside, you\u2019ll need to reapply SPF over any tinted formula. In this case, experts recommend using brush-on powdered sunscreen to make it easy.",
      "It depends. Cosmetically, there\u2019s a difference between the two: Face sunscreen tends to be lighter and have hydrating, soothing ingredients (like niacinamide, ceramides, or hyaluronic acid), whereas body sunscreens are typically thicker, can feel greasier, and may have more of a \u2018sunscreen smell,\u2019 according to experts I spoke with. Body sunscreens also tend to clog pores more easily on your face and may not be suitable for acne-prone skin, our experts say. A pro, however, is that they\u2019re more likely made to have water resistance, says Camp.",
      "There\u2019s also pricing to consider: Facial sunscreens are usually packaged in smaller quantities than body sunscreens, making it less economical to use them on larger surface areas.",
      "\u201cAs for using them interchangeably, my biggest concern would be tolerability,\u201d says Boucher. (See our shopping tips below for how to know which formulas are best for your skin type).",
      "There are two main types of sunscreen: chemical and mineral sunscreens. The key difference between the two comes down to active ingredients:",
      "Mineral sunscreens: also known as physical sunscreens or sunblocks, have either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide (sometimes both) and sit on top of the skin to physically shield it from harmful UV rays and block them from penetrating the skin\u2019s surface. Mineral sunscreens are great for sensitive skin (experts also recommend this type of sunscreen for children) because they\u2019re less likely to cause irritation since the skin doesn\u2019t absorb them. However, they tend to leave a white cast and \u201cmay also feel chalky, heavy or tacky, especially at higher SPF levels with higher concentration of zinc oxide,\u201d says Zeichner.",

      "Chemical sunscreens: On the other hand, these rely on active ingredients like avobenzone, octinoxate, benzophenone and methoxycinnamate to protect you from the sun. Your skin absorbs these UV filters and transforms the UV rays into heat, according to Dr. Corey L. Hartman, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Skin Wellness Dermatology in Birmingham, Alabama. Unlike physical blockers, chemical sunscreens are less likely to leave a white cast on the skin because they absorb into it, which can make them a better option for those with darker skin tones, says Hartman. People with acne-prone and sensitive skin may experience breakouts or irritation when using chemical sunscreen, according to Dr. Zakia Rahman, a board-certified dermatologist, clinical professor of dermatology and director of the Resident Laser and Aesthetic Clinic at Stanford Health Care.",

      "Choosing a mineral or chemical sunscreen should really come down to personal preference. \u201cUltimately, choose the one that feels good when you apply it,\u201d says Hartman. \u201cThe biggest challenge with sunscreen is compliance \u2014 if you find one you like, you\u2019re more likely to use it.\u201d",
      "Both tinted and non-tinted sunscreens offer UV protection, but there are some additional advantages to using a tinted sunscreen, according to Huang. Most tinted sunscreens have iron oxide, which can protect against the visible light spectrum (including blue light) as well as ultraviolet light (UVA and UVB), he says. Aesthetically, they also help even out complexion and cover up blemishes.",
      "How to shop for face sunscreen based on your skin type",
      "Facial sunscreens typically come in various forms: lotions, creams and powders. When shopping, our experts recommend considering your specific skin type. Though the active ingredients are what protects your skin from the sun\u2019s harmful UV rays (and determine whether you should purchase a chemical or physical sunscreen), it\u2019s the inactive ingredients that can determine how your skin will react to the product. Below, our experts break down how to determine the best sunscreen for your skin type:",
      "Dry: Sunscreens formulated with humectants like hyaluronic acid and ceramides, and emollients like coconut, jojoba and mineral oils will help hydrate the skin. You can also look for occlusives like glycerin and dimethicone, which sit on top of the skin and help seal in moisture.Oily: Look for sunscreens labeled oil-free and opt for oil-absorbing ingredients like silica gel. Sensitive: \u201cWhen it comes to sensitive skin, the simpler the formula, the less likely it will cause irritation,\u201d says Zeichner. You should avoid possible irritants, like fragrances, botanical extracts and essential oils, and stick to mineral sunscreens that have zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide, which are less likely to cause a reaction.Acne-prone: Look for sunscreens that are fragrance-free and labeled noncomedogenic. (Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are popular noncomedogenic ingredients). Consider lightweight formulas like lotions, gels and powders since they won\u2019t feel heavy on top of your skin compared to thicker creams, says Dr. Michele Farber, a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in Philadelphia.",

A few episodes later, Earl was not happy with Shannon for choosing to go out with her \u201cLove Hotel\u201d castmates, Luann de Lesseps, Ashley Darby and Gizelle Bryant, instead of being there for him as he stressed over the path of a hurricane headed toward his Florida and Georgia homes.",

      "\u201cI know that when I watch a show, and I\u2019m invested in certain people, I want them to stay together,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it was important for me to try my hardest to make it work.\u201d",
      "As for what she\u2019s looking for in a partner, Shannon, who also describes herself as \u201ca relationship girl,\u201d says she, most importantly, wants someone with \u201ca kind heart,\u201d adding that looks are \u201cnot that important.\u201d",

Because that\u2019s a really hard thing when you\u2019ve been doing it for as long as we have, that, you know, does someone want to be famous or not?\u201d Shannon says.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what happened in my last relationship,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe wanted to be, and I didn\u2019t think he did.\u201d"

      "The icing on the cake was when Louis mimicked his big brother, George. After George absent-mindedly flipped his hair back, Louis followed by performing a cheeky impression of him."

    "story": [
      "If you stand still too long, people will peg you \u2014 at least according to Bryan Cranston. \u201cI like to keep people guessing,\u201d he tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview.",
      "That\u2019s why the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d actor says he prefers to \u201ckeep moving around\u201d instead.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m playing a lot of dramatic roles recently, I will look for comedic roles and I keep swimming back and forth so that I\u2019m not pegged as any given one person,\u201d he says.",
      "It\u2019s that versatility that\u2019s earned Cranston six Emmy Awards, two Tonys, a best actor Oscar nomination and a host of other accolades. And, at 69, he shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.",
      "Cranston currently appears in the latest Wes Anderson film, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d along with starring in \u201cEverything\u2019s Going to Be Great,\u201d a new drama for which Cranston learned how to play the bagpipes. If that\u2019s not enough, he\u2019ll soon be crossing the Atlantic to perform on London\u2019s famed West End in the Arthur Miller play \u201cAll My Sons,\u201d starting in November.",
      "\u201cI do love it. I have a relationship with this,\u201d explains Cranston. \u201cIt takes a committed relationship, that you\u2019re committing to this as your life, just like you would in your personal life. And if you do so, you have a chance to be successful in your personal life or your business life.\u201d",
      "No stranger to success, Cranston got his start doing bit parts in a variety of TV shows and movies before landing the breakout role of Hal Wilkerson in \u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d in 2000. It's a role that earned him a handful of Emmy nominations and made Cranston a household name.",
      "However, it was the brief part he played in a 1998 episode of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d that put Cranston on the radar of one of the show\u2019s writers, Vince Gilligan. Eight years later, when Gilligan went to cast Walter White in his new antihero show, \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d he remembered Cranston and rang up the actor\u2019s agent. That decision would forever cement their legacies in television history.",
      "'You\u2019re Only as Good as You Dare to Be Bad'",
      "With a storied career in film, stage and television (both behind and in front of the camera), Cranston says he continues to seek out unique roles and opportunities that speak to him on a personal level.",
      "\u201cMy real life is filled with a variety of different characters. I\u2019m sometimes sincere, sometimes silly, sometimes moody, sometimes romantic ... and so there are different facets of ourselves that you are familiar with in your own life. Sometimes you\u2019re sad, sometimes you\u2019re joyous,\u201d explains Cranston.",
      "\u201cSo, I curate the roles I do. I look for roles that I can be different or something that challenges me that, 'Ooh, that\u2019s really not like me at all,' so I need to dive into that and see what comes of it,\u201d he says.",
      "In fact, it\u2019s his willingness to take risks that\u2019s gotten him this far, and it\u2019s based on advice he once received. Though Cranston can\u2019t quite remember exactly where he got it from, he says that outside of being kind, working hard and showing up on time, it's the best advice he's ever gotten.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re only as good as you dare to be bad, right? If you take chances that you could fall on your face, you could fail, it\u2019s that point that you can also turn and have it really work. So, don\u2019t play safe. Extend yourself, take chances, take risks and see what happens,\u201d Cranston tells TODAY.com.",
      "Is that the advice he gives his daughter, actor Taylor Dearden?",
      "\u201cFirst of all, as her dad, she does not want my direct advice,\u201d he says with a laugh about Dearden, whom he shares with wife Robin Dearden. The 32-year-old currently stars in the Max hospital drama \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d a role for which she\u2019s garnered glowing reviews.",
      "\u201cTaylor is a wonderful, hardworking actor,\u201d Cranston told Craig Melvin during a recent segment on TODAY. \u201cShe grew up in this business with my wife and I being actors. And so, we\u2019re so proud of her.\u201d",
      "\u2018I Need to Outwork Everyone\u2019",
      "While Cranston may not dole out much career advice to Dearden, he tells TODAY.com that he does what he can to be a solid role model instead.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that I can relay to her is how I have been for her 32 years on this planet and try to live a good life and be an exemplar to her, as she can look at and say, \u2018Well, this is how he did things and that seemed to work for him.\u2019 Or, \u2018Oh, he tried that and that didn\u2019t work, so I\u2019m going to do something different,\u2019\u201d he explains.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s basically it. Just live a true life and let your kids see that and hopefully they\u2019ll make their own proper decisions.\u201d",
      "That mindset likely comes from his parents, who Cranston says were instrumental in instilling his own work ethic.",
      "\u201cBoth my mother and father were hardworking people and they came from very humble, hardworking families, (they were) children during the Depression. It was, go out there every single day, try to find a job. That\u2019s what their parents were faced with. And so it carries on,\u201d says Cranston.",
      "With his parents as his example, Cranston says he learned early on that if he wanted to make a career out of acting, he needed to be fully committed.",
      "\u201cI realized as a young actor that there were always going to be actors who were better than me. At the same time, there were always going to be actors who weren\u2019t as good as me. And the only thing I can control is how hard I worked,\u201d he explains.",
      "\u201cI know I can outwork people and that was my motto \u2014 I need to outwork everyone. So when I was a young actor, 22, 23, people were going out and they were partying every night. Not me. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to class. I\u2019m studying. I\u2019m learning monologues because I need to outwork everybody and I need to be ready.\u2019 And that was it, because this is what I wanted. I wanted a career as an actor.\u201d",
      "And it\u2019s that advice that Cranston passes along to young actors hoping to follow in his footsteps.",
      "\u201cI say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to commit.\u2019 It\u2019s got to be, \u2018You\u2019re all in, go all in.\u2019 Because if you\u2019re not putting all of your energy into it, what are you waiting for? Why would you not? You've got to. And it still doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be successful, just like a personal life. But you\u2019ve got to try, and that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d"

      "This love triangle was not a part of Song\u2019s own time as a matchmaker, though other moments in the film do come from her past. An ending courthouse wedding scene was inspired by her own civil ceremony with husband and \u201cChallengers\u201d screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes.",
      "\u201cI got married at the courthouse first,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a party after.\u201d",
      "Song ultimately decided to call it quits as a matchmaker, \u201cbecause I wasn\u2019t writing, because it was too fun,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was supposed to be a day job and it was becoming like my full time thing ... I only did it for six months but some of them resulted in a second date, which is a win.\u201d",
      "When it comes to drawing inspiration from her personal experiences for her work, Song says it has to teach her something and \u201cit always has to be something that fascinates me.\u201d",

      "Later on, Lucy discovers that Harry actually had the surgery and added six inches to his height. He admits that after the procedure, his whole life changed and more women became interested in him.",
      "While the audience laughed in the screening I attended during those moments, Song calls it \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking because you\u2019re seeing the way that it is materially and tangibly affecting somebody like Harry. The standards, numbers like height, all of that,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhat Harry is going through is very difficult as well, and I\u2019m really interested in depicting men fairly.\u201d",
      "The idea of a \u201cunicorn,\u201d a rare and nearly perfect candidate, is also a product of the materialistic world, Song says. She hopes male viewers can relate.",
      "\u201cSo often the topics of romance are reduced to girl s---,\u201d she says, adding that matters of the heart are not just for women. \u201cThe truth is, men are also crushed by the dating market. They\u2019re also crushed by the way that we date and with the way that we objectify and commodify ourselves and each other. I really wanted there to be a very real consequence for men in the film, and have them be crushed by the same dating market that crushes (Lucy's client) Sophie or Lucy.\u201d",
      "Song hopes \u201cMaterialists\u201d start an open-hearted and honest conversation about what it\u2019s like to date and love in 2025.",
      "And when asked, \u201cIs love easy?\u201d Song replies, \u201cLove is easy.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s also hard when people are afraid to let go of control and completely surrender,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut the truth is, I think, when it happens, it just happens. They say, \u2018If you know, you know.\u2019 That\u2019s kind of what it is. You face it, and then when you face love, it\u2019s very simple and it\u2019s very easy.\u201d"

    "published": "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump had opposed Israeli action against Iran, but came to believe Israel had reason to act and that the U.S. would have to lend some support.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump had opposed Israeli military action against Iran, favoring negotiations over bombing. But in the days before the strikes began, he became convinced that Israel\u2019s heightened anxiety over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment capabilities was warranted.",
      "After a pivotal briefing from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, on Israel\u2019s plans and U.S. options for supporting its operation, he gave tacit approval to Israel to have at it and decided to provide limited U.S. backing.",
      "When Caine briefed him on June 8, Trump was increasingly frustrated with Iran for not responding to the latest proposal for a nuclear deal. He still remained hopeful that his Middle East peace negotiator, Steve Witkoff, who had been scheduled to conduct another round of peace talks in the region Sunday, could soon get an agreement over the line.",
      "Trump was also facing private pressure from longtime allies who advocate more isolationist policies and wanted him to stop Israel from taking military action or at least withhold U.S. support for any such operation.",
      "This account of Trump\u2019s thinking leading up to the Israeli operation is based on interviews with five current U.S. officials and two Middle Eastern officials, as well as two people with knowledge of the deliberations, two former U.S officials familiar with the deliberations and a Trump ally. The White House didn\u2019t immediately comment, and the Defense Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "In recent weeks, Israel grew more convinced that the threat posed by Tehran was getting increasingly serious and urgent. And while he had already decided not to stand in Israel\u2019s way, on Thursday, only hours before the strikes began, Trump remained at least publicly hopeful that diplomacy would win the day.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want them going in, because I think it would blow it \u2014 might help it actually, but it also could blow it, but we\u2019ve had very good discussions with Iran,\u201d Trump told reporters at a bill signing ceremony. \u201cI prefer the more friendly path.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the Israelis had already laid much of the groundwork for Trump\u2019s measured change. Trump had hoped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be persuaded not to mount an attack. But over the past week, he came to accept that Israel was determined to neutralize Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities and that the United States would have to lend some military support for defensive purposes, as well as some intelligence support.",
      "After the strikes began Thursday evening, the administration took pains to say it had provided no military assistance to Israel, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also the national security adviser, pointedly omitted any mention of U.S. support for Israel\u2019s operations in a statement. But the administration\u2019s public statements the next day did leave the door open to the United States\u2019 having provided some of the kind of intelligence Israel needed to mount an attack.",
      "Israel was able to conduct its initial strikes mostly with its own intelligence and capabilities \u2014 killing three military leaders and nine top scientists working on nuclear enrichment and destroying several nuclear enrichment sites, Israeli officials have said \u2014 but it also leaned heavily on American intelligence, bunker-buster bombs that were provided this year and air defense systems, some of which were scrambled into the region quickly in recent days.",
      "But Trump still wouldn\u2019t sign off on everything Israel wanted. After the start of their military campaign, the Israelis collected intelligence that could have allowed them to target and kill Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Netanyahu presented the operation to Trump, who opposed the plan altogether and wouldn\u2019t allow the United States to participate, according to two U.S. officials. No Americans had been killed in the conflict, so Trump didn\u2019t believe it would be appropriate to remove Khamenei, the political leader, and recommended against the Israelis\u2019 conducting the operation, the officials said.",
      "On Sunday, he appeared to advocate again for talks over strikes, saying on his social media platform, Truth Social: \u201cIran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal, just like I got India and Pakistan to make. ... Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that\u2019s OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach to Israel\u2019s military campaign started to take form last Sunday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in rural Maryland. By that time, Israeli officials had already begun to share extensive information with U.S. officials about their potential operation. Caine, the Joint Chiefs chairman, briefed Trump and his national security team about the Israeli plans to strike Iran and U.S. options, according to two U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the deliberations.",
      "Those options, the three sources said, included logistical support, like refueling Israeli jet fighters, sharing intelligence and using the American military\u2019s electronic warfare capabilities to help Israel jam enemy weapons and communications. Another option was to provide direct military support to Israel, even having U.S. jets drop munitions in active combat alongside Israeli fighters, for example.",
      "And yet another option, Caine briefed Trump, was to do nothing at all.",
      "Trump has consistently said he wants to extract the United States from foreign conflicts and has sought to use diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and the fighting in Gaza, albeit without success.",
      "But Israel was getting anxious, and it wasn\u2019t convinced that Trump\u2019s plan for peace in the region would work. Netanyahu and his war Cabinet didn\u2019t have faith in the U.S. negotiations with Iran taking place in Oman, despite Washington\u2019s public pronouncements that a deal was close.",
      "For months, the Trump administration has pressed the Israelis not to carry out strikes on Iran and warned that the United States wouldn\u2019t support them if they did.",
      "By the end of last week, the White House\u2019s public tone started to include more support for Israel, and in private it shifted from strong opposition against a widespread military operation to acceptance that it was likely to happen and less resistance to it.",
      "Among the reasons for Trump\u2019s change of heart was the declaration Thursday by the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran was in breach of its nonproliferation requirements. Trump was also concerned by the sense coming from Israel, the United States and the IAEA that Iran had achieved leaps in its nuclear program, and he didn\u2019t want to be the president on whose watch it was able to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "The United States had already been quietly moving some pieces into place to prepare for the Israeli attack. In recent days, U.S. European Command was told some of its P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance planes would be diverted to the Middle East to conduct surveillance.",
      "Then, in remarks that drew little attention last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that more than 20,000 U.S. anti-drone missiles meant for Kyiv had been diverted \u2014 to the Middle East.",
      "Trump and Netanyahu spoke several times in the previous week, but by last Monday, Trump had grown convinced that Israel was going to strike and was starting to put more pieces into place to help support the strike.",
      "Soon after that conversation last Monday, the Pentagon directed European Command to send a Navy destroyer to sit off Israel to help defend it in the likely event of a counterattack from Tehran, joining two more and a carrier strike group already there.",
      "Witkoff had been expected to travel to Muscat for peace talks as late as Friday. With the conflict still active, the U.S. side acknowledged that those talks were off. But it\u2019s not shutting the door to future discussions.",
      "\u201cWhile there will be no meeting Sunday, we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon,\u201d an administration official told news organizations."

      "LONDON \u2014 British soccer legend David Beckham, a sporting icon and one of the world's most recognizable faces, has received a knighthood from King Charles III for services to sport and charity,  Buckingham Palace announced Friday.",
      "\u201cGrowing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honor,\" Beckham said in a statement issued Friday through the Press Association news agency.",
      "The award, the highest Britain's antiquated honors system can bestow, was almost inevitable given Beckham's success as a player and his contribution to the country's culture. For years, Britons have wondered how he had not already been elevated to Sir David.",
      "He gets the \"gong,\" as it's known in British parlance, as part of the king's birthday honors list, which rewards notable people from across British society.",
      "The move also means his famous wife, Spice Girl-turned-fashion mogul Victoria, will now be known as Lady Beckham. Their marriage in 1999 made them Britain's most famous couple and near-permanent fixtures in tabloid newspapers and magazines, an obsession that has lasted into the age of social media.",
      "\u201cIt will take a little while for the news to sink in but I\u2019m immensely proud and it\u2019s such an emotional moment for me to share with my family,\" Beckham said.",
      "Beckham, 50, rose from an unremarkable east London upbringing to reach sporting glory with his beloved Manchester United before going on to star for several of Europe's elite teams. He played more than 100 games for the English national team, many as captain, and scored at three World Cups.",
      "He was part of the famous \"Class of \u201992,\" a supremely talented group of young players who signed professional deals in 1992 and went on to form the basis of United's imperial phase of dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. That culminated in the club's winning an unprecedented \"treble\" of titles in 1999: the Premier League, the European Champions League and the English FA Cup, under manager Alex Ferguson.",
      "Beckham won 19 major trophies in his career and became the first English player to win major titles in four countries.",
      "\u201cTo have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true,\u201d he said in his statement.",
      "Beckham was an elegant player, and his intelligence made up for his lack of pace and trickery. He was famous for his long passes that opened up defenses and for devastating free kicks, which, according to former teammates, he spent countless hours perfecting.",
      "His career took him to the United States in 2007, where he played for the Los Angeles Galaxy and helped to build soccer's profile in the country.",
      "Beckham has been an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's fund, since 2005. Ten years later, the organization launched a fund in his name.",
      "\u201cOff the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation,\" his statement said. \"I\u2019m so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I\u2019m grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.\"",
      "Beckham's post-playing career was shaped in part by media entrepreneur Simon Fuller, formerly manager of the Spice Girls. Fuller was instrumental in putting a clause in his contract that would give him a stake in an MLS franchise for $25 million when he finished playing.",
      "As a result, he is now president and co-owner of the Inter Miami MLS franchise, home to Argentine legend Lionel Messi, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport's history.",
      "Beckham has maintained a higher profile than any footballer of his generation. From waiting for hours in the miles-long line to see Queen Elizabeth's coffin (apparently without asking for special access) in 2022 to a four-part Emmy-winning docuseries on Netflix last year, his star profile remains huge.",
      "In 2017, it looked like a knighthood was a long way off when leaked emails allegedly written by Beckham were highly critical of the honors system. A spokesperson for the Beckhams said at the time that the stolen emails were \"hacked and doctored.\"",
      "While they are awarded by the king, or at least a senior royal, honors are actually decided by committees of politicians, civil servants and leading business figures. The overall process is managed by 10 Downing Street, the private office and residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who received a knighthood in 2014."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet for trade talks in London this week, a primary concern for Washington will be whether Beijing eases the flow of rare earth materials, which have become key components of modern life.",
      "China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, mining about 70% and refining 90% of the materials used to produce everything from wind turbines and defense equipment to electric vehicles and car seats. The United States produces virtually none of the world\u2019s rare earths, whose extraction can be devastating for the environment.",
      "That economic vulnerability has come into sharper focus since April, when China imposed export controls on seven strategic rare earth metals and related magnets amid an escalating trade war with President Donald Trump. Companies, especially automakers and business associations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have sounded the alarm, warning that China\u2019s rare earth restrictions risk delays that could bring manufacturing to a halt.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Monday that U.S. negotiators in London were seeking a \u201chandshake\u201d from China on rare earths after Trump said last week that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to resume their flow in the first call between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.",
      "\u201cThey were kind of releasing them, but it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,\u201d Hassett said.",
      "In an editorial Monday, the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said the rare earth export controls were not a \u201cshort-term bargaining chip\u201d for trade talks but a responsible policy aimed at preventing rare earths, which have both civilian and military uses, \u201cfrom being used in activities that threaten international peace and security.\u201d",
      "\u201cImposing export controls on strategic resources with clear dual-use characteristics is a common international practice and a legitimate right of sovereign nations to safeguard their own security,\u201d the editorial said.",
      "Signs of hope have appeared in recent days. On Saturday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it was open to talks on rare earth export controls, and that it \u201cfully considers the legitimate needs and concerns of other countries.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "OTTAWA, Ontario \u2014 Britain\u2019s real-life spies have finally caught up with James Bond. MI6 has appointed its first female chief.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Sunday that Blaise Metreweli will be the next head of the U.K.\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, and the first woman to hold the post since its founding in 1909. She is currently the MI6 director of technology and innovation \u2014 the real-world equivalent of Bond gadget-master Q.",
      "A career intelligence officer, Metreweli, 47, steps from the shadows into the light as the only MI6 employee whose name is made public. She said \u201cI am proud and honored to be asked to lead my Service.\u201d",
      "Starmer said the \u201chistoric appointment\u201d comes at a time \u201cwhen the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital.",
      "\u201cThe United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale \u2014 be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber plots seek to disrupt our public services,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer made the announcement as he arrived in the Canadian province of Alberta for a Group of Seven leaders\u2019 summit.",
      "Metreweli takes over at MI6 as the agency faces growing challenges from states including China and Russia, whose use of cyber tools, espionage and influence operations threatens global stability and British interests, even as it remains on alert against terrorist threats.",
      "Metreweli is the first woman to get the top job, known as C \u2014 rather than M, the fictional MI6 chief of the 007 thrillers. M was played onscreen by Judi Dench in seven Bond movies starting in the 1990s.",
      "She will take up her post in the fall, replacing Richard Moore, who has held the job for five years.",
      "Britain\u2019s two other main intelligence agencies have already shattered the spy world\u2019s glass ceiling. MI5, the domestic security service, was led by Stella Rimington from 1992 to 1996 and Eliza Manningham-Buller from 2002 to 2007. Anne Keast-Butler became head of electronic and cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ in 2023.",
      "Moore, an Oxford-educated former diplomat, fit the 007 mold like a Savile Row suit. But in recent years MI6 has worked to increase diversity, broadening its recruitment process from the traditional \u201ctap on the shoulder\u201d at an elite university. The agency\u2019s website stresses its family-friendly flexible working policy and goal of recruiting \u201ctalented people from all backgrounds.\u201d",
      "Moore suggested he would like his successor to be a woman. He wrote on X in 2023 that he would \u201chelp forge women\u2019s equality by working to ensure I\u2019m the last C selected from an all-male shortlist.\u201d",
      "Like many things about MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service, the process of choosing a new chief took place out of public view. It began with the country\u2019s top civil servant writing to government departments in March asking them to put forward candidates. The job was open to applicants from other intelligence agencies, the civil service, the diplomatic service, the armed forces or the police.",
      "In the end, MI6 opted for an internal candidate with a 25-year career in espionage, a degree in anthropology from Cambridge University \u2014 where she was on the women\u2019s rowing team \u2014 and expertise in cutting-edge technology.",
      "\u201cAt a time of global instability and emerging security threats, where technology is power and our adversaries are working ever closer together, Blaise will ensure the U.K. can tackle these challenges head on to keep Britain safe and secure at home and abroad,\u201d said Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who oversees MI6."

    "story": [
      "Israeli military assaults on the Gaza Strip\u2019s hospitals have ramped up in recent weeks to the highest level so far this year, bringing a health system already weakened by 19 months of war to a breaking point. NBC News has analyzed 27 videos and images from the last two months taken by civilians and our own journalists on the ground to piece together a picture of the full extent of the destruction of a health system engulfed in war.",
      "In footage from a surveillance camera, men, women and children could be seen crossing the entrance to Khan Younis\u2019 European Hospital moments before a missile hit, blasting people into the air as others scattered in panic. Another video, posted to social media and verified by NBC News, showed the fiery aftermath of an explosion at a medical warehouse near Al-Awda Hospital, in northern Gaza, which has been attacked repeatedly, including on May 22 and again on May 24.",
      "\u201cNearly all hospitals in Gaza are now damaged or destroyed, and half of them are no longer operational,\u201d Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, told NBC News. During the war, Gaza\u2019s hospitals have eked back services, only to be repeatedly struck or besieged again.",
      "Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law, but Israel has maintained that Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers for military activities, opening them to attack. Hamas has denied doing so. Humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, have said Israel has not provided sufficient information to substantiate many of its claims and have called for independent investigations of Israel\u2019s attacks and Hamas\u2019 alleged misuse of the facilities.",
      "Earlier this week, however, the Israeli military gave a small group of reporters a tour of a tunnel that was uncovered beneath the European Hospital, where it said it had recovered the body of Hamas\u2019 military chief Mohammed Sinwar.",
      "\u201cWe cannot stress this enough: Hospitals must never be militarized or targeted. If they are, it may constitute a war crime,\u201d Laerke said.",
      "Of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals, none are fully functioning; 17 are providing partial services, and 19 are not functioning at all, according to World Health Organization data from Monday. The wider health system, including ambulances, field hospitals and clinics, has been attacked more than 700 times since the start of the war, killing at least 900 people and injuring more than 1,000. (The death toll across Gaza is more than 55,000, according to the health ministry.)",
      "After a ceasefire was called in January, Israeli military attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system had abated. The truce fell apart in March, and WHO data shows a ramping up of attacks in recent weeks. While the organization tallied five attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system in April, after the first three weeks of May, the number of attacks had quadrupled to 21, with at least three more attacks since, including on the vicinity of a dialysis center at the Indonesian Hospital on June 1 and strikes on Al-Aqsa and Al-Ahli Hospitals on June 4 and 5. In addition, hostilities near Al-Amal Hospital have rendered it \u201cout of service,\u201d the WHO said Monday.",
      "The earliest attack recorded by NBC News during that two-month period was on April 2, when an Israeli airstrike hit a UNRWA clinic in Jabalia, north of Gaza City, that was housing displaced people. Video captured by NBC News on the ground documented the chaotic aftermath: walls crushed to rubble, charred mattresses, furniture blasted into shards. A child\u2019s small, shrouded body was loaded onto a donkey cart to be taken to the morgue.",
      "In another case, the Israel Defense Forces struck two hospitals on the same day, May 13, both in Khan Younis. Video verified by NBC News shows several large plumes of smoke rising from the grounds of the European Hospital. Palestinian health officials said at least 16 people were killed and dozens more injured. The WHO said the facility had been forced to suspend services.",
      "Also struck that day was the Nasser Medical Complex. Video posted by the U.N. showed scattered debris, twisted hospital beds and damaged equipment. It was the fourth time Nasser had been hit during the war, according to the U.N., with the latest strike killing two people and injuring a dozen others.",
      "In a statement in response to those attacks, the IDF said its forces had targeted a command and control center located at Nasser Hospital and \u201ca Hamas underground terrorist infrastructure site\u201d underneath the European Hospital.",
      "The IDF provided evidence of what it said was a Hamas tunnel beneath the European Hospital. It did not, however, provide evidence for the command and control center at Nasser, or for the following cases, but broadly said: \u201cThe Hamas terrorist organization continues to use hospitals in the Gaza Strip for terrorist activity.\u201d NBC News is not able to independently verify the IDF\u2019s statements."

Most of the population is displaced, and malnutrition is widespread.",
      "Despite efforts by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar to restore a ceasefire in Gaza, neither Israel nor Hamas has shown willingness to back down on core demands, with each side blaming the other for the failure to reach a deal."

      "But \u2014 assuming that it still can \u2014 there is a scenario in which the strikes could lead Tehran to abandon negotiations over its nuclear program and instead rush toward building a bomb, according to analysts and former U.S. officials.",
      "The killing of top Iranian military officers as well as several nuclear scientists will likely have sparked fears in Tehran that Israeli intelligence had deeply penetrated the regime and that other senior figures could also be in danger.",

      "The senior military officers targeted had deep ties to Iran\u2019s regime and were known personally by the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, particularly Bagheri, according to Vatanka. Khamenei promoted Bagheri to his post as chief of the armed forces in 2016.",

      "But Iran still has buried nuclear facilities at Fordow and elsewhere that it could potentially use if it chose to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and rescind its commitment not to pursue nuclear weapons. In that case, Iran would need to enrich uranium to weapon-grade levels, a short technical step with its current stockpile, and then build a nuclear warhead. That effort could take roughly a year or more, most experts estimate.",
      "The CIA declined to comment as to whether there were any indications that Iran was moving to pull out of the NPT and pursue nuclear weapons.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be trying to use the Israeli military attack as leverage over Iran, pushing it to make concessions or else face even harsher military strikes. But Iran may calculate that the time for negotiations is over and opt to build nuclear weapons, according to Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank.",
      "\u201cOne of the strategic risks in targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure is the potential for backlash,\u201d Vaez said. The strikes \u201ccould incentivize Tehran to reconstitute its program with renewed urgency, driven by a heightened resolve to achieve a credible nuclear deterrent,\u201d he said.",
      "Iran has invested decades of effort and trillions of dollars in building its nuclear program, and Iranian political leaders portray it as a point of national pride, a symbol of the country\u2019s independence and technological progress.",
      "Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, said Iran\u2019s leadership will likely choose to develop nuclear weapons rather than give up the program it sees as a patriotic endeavor.",
      "\u201cIt has become a symbol of national prestige and honor,\u201d Miller said on MSNBC.",
      "\u201cWhen all is said and done, and this regime stays in power, which I suspect it will, the Iranians will probably make a decision to go all out in an effort to weaponize,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd the Americans and the Israelis are going to have to figure out, over time, how to deal with it.\u201c",
      "Jonathan Panikoff, a former deputy national intelligence officer for the Near East at the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said that Iran may conclude that pursuing nuclear weapons is the only way to safeguard the regime.",
      "Iran \u201cmay determine that the Israeli strikes mean time is up for the regime to decide whether to obtain a bomb, if it hasn\u2019t done so already,\u201d Panikoff, now at the Atlantic Council think tank, wrote in an analysis. \u201cThe conclusion could be that it can no longer sit on the proverbial nuclear fence, and that it has to rush for a bomb or risk never having one.\u201d",
      "To many Iranian political leaders, securing a nuclear weapon -- or nuclear weapons capability -- is vital for the survival of the regime itself, he added.",
      "But it was unclear if Israel\u2019s military strikes could deliver a knock-out blow that would make it impossible for Iran to build nuclear weapons, some experts said.",
      "Alex Plitsas, a former senior Pentagon official and a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said it was likely that the Israeli assault, which included sabotage operations, had caused too much damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and equipment to enable Iran to rush toward building a bomb.",
      "Iran was caught flat-footed by the Israeli attack, even though Israel had sent clear warnings for years and in recent months that it would not tolerate an advancing Iranian nuclear program, Plitsas said.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians have misread the signals from Israel again and again,\u201d he said.",
      "Even a successful series of strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear sites might only delay Tehran\u2019s ability to develop the bomb by up to two years, according to past comments by U.S. officials and estimates by experts.",
      "In 2012, Robert Gates, shortly after he stepped down as defense secretary, said military strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear program would likely fail in the end to prevent Tehran from developing the bomb.",
      "\u201cSuch an attack would make a nuclear-armed Iran inevitable,\u201d Gates said at the time. \u201cThey would just bury the program deeper and make it more covert.\u201d",
      "Iran maintains its nuclear program is designed for purely civilian purposes to generate energy and research, but Western powers have long accused Tehran of laying the ground for a nuclear weapons project, citing enrichment activity far beyond what\u2019s required for peaceful uses. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Iran had a nuclear weapons program but halted the project in 2003.",
      "A report in May from the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded Iran was not fully cooperating with U.N. inspectors and that the agency could not provide assurance that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cexclusively peaceful.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, the IAEA censured Iran for failing to comply with nonproliferation obligations designed to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. It was the first such censure in 20 years.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have criticized Trump for pulling, during his first term, the U.S. out of a 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran that imposed limits on its nuclear activities, saying that decision opened the way to the current crisis."

      "The Israeli military launched a massive attack on Iran on Friday in a dramatic escalation of their long-running conflict that drew a retaliatory missile assault from Tehran and raised the risk of another war in the Middle East.",
      "The Israeli strikes took out a significant swath of Iran's top military leaders and senior scientists, as Israel unleashed more than 200 fighter jets across roughly 100 targets. They were aimed at Iran\u2019s main enrichment facility and targets associated with the country\u2019s ballistic missile program, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.",
      "In a firm response Friday evening local time, Iran launched missiles toward Israel, the nation\u2019s defense forces said, prompting its highly sophisticated defense systems to \"intercept the threat.\"",
      "Heavy smoke appeared in the night sky over Tel Aviv as incoming rockets from Iran descended on the city, with many intercepted by Israel\u2019s missile defense systems. Before the retaliatory attack began, the Israel Defense Forces directed residents across the country to remain close to protected spaces, minimize movement in public areas and avoid public gatherings.",
      "Police officers and bomb disposal experts responded to reports of fallen projectile debris, according to the Israeli Police, which advised people to report \u201csuspicious findings\u201d to an emergency hotline.",
      "Israel's emergency service, Magen David Adom, said it was providing medical treatment to 34 injured people following a rocket strike in Israel's central region.",
      "The Israeli paramedic organization also said it was providing treatment and evacuating at least 21 people after a strike south of Tel Aviv.",
      "Iran later launched a fresh wave of missiles in the early hours of Saturday morning local time, Israel Defense Forces said.",
      "A Tel Aviv hospital treated seven people with injuries following the early morning attack, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Israel's strikes have killed 78 people so far, including senior military officials, and injured 320 people, according to Iranian ambassador to the United Nations Ali Bahreini. Residential buildings were among the structures damaged in Tehran.",
      "Loud explosions in Iran were heard in the northern part of the capital on Friday night, while state media reported attacks in Qom, located south of Tehran and a holy city for Shia Muslims. Fars reported on X that explosions could be heard in the area of the heavily fortified nuclear site of Fordow, which is located deep underground near Qom.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei swiftly vowed retaliation, telling his nation in a televised address Friday evening local time that Israel would be punished."

    "story": [
      "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that concerns over national security risks posed by Nippon Steel\u2019s $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel can be resolved if the companies fulfill certain conditions that his administration has laid out, paving the way for the deal\u2019s approval.",
      "Shares of U.S. Steel rose 3.5% on the news in after-the-bell trading as investors bet the deal was close to done. Trump, in an executive order, said conditions for resolving the national security concerns would be laid out in an agreement, without providing details. \u201cI additionally find that the threatened impairment to the national security of the United States arising as a result of the Proposed Transaction can be adequately mitigated if the conditions set forth in section 3 of this order are met,\u201d Trump said in the order, which was released by the White House.",
      "The companies thanked Trump in a news release, saying the agreement includes $11 billion in new investments to be made by 2028 and governance commitments including a golden share to be issued to the U.S. government. They did not detail how much control the golden share would give the U.S. Shares of U.S. Steel had dipped earlier on Friday after a Nippon Steel executive told the Japanese Nikkei newspaper that its planned takeover of U.S. Steel required \u201ca degree of management freedom\u201d to go ahead after Trump earlier had said the U.S. would be in control with a golden share.",
      "The bid, first announced by Nippon Steel in December 2023, has faced opposition from the start. Both Democratic former President Joe Biden and Trump, a Republican, asserted last year that U.S. Steel should remain U.S.-owned, as they sought to woo voters ahead of the presidential election in Pennsylvania, where the company is headquartered.",
      "Biden in January, shortly before leaving office, blocked the deal on national security grounds, prompting lawsuits by the companies, which argued the national security review they received was biased. The Biden White House disputed the charge.",
      "The steel companies saw a new opportunity in the Trump administration, which began on January 20 and opened a fresh 45-day national security review into the proposed merger in April.",
      "But Trump\u2019s public comments, ranging from welcoming a simple \u201cinvestment\u201d in U.S. Steel by the Japanese firm to floating a minority stake for Nippon Steel, spurred confusion.",
      "At a rally in Pennsylvania on May 30, Trump lauded an agreement between the companies and said Nippon Steel would make a \u201cgreat partner\u201d for U.S. Steel. But he later told reporters the deal still lacked his final approval, leaving unresolved whether he would allow Nippon Steel to take ownership.",
      "Nippon Steel and the Trump administration asked a U.S. appeals court on June 5 for an eight-day extension of a pause in litigation to give them more time to reach a deal for the Japanese firm. The pause expires Friday, but could be extended.",
      "June 18 is the expiration date of the current acquisition contract between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, but the firms could agree to postpone that date."

    "published": "Fri, 13 Jun 2025 19:37:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Israel's latest action pits traditional Republican support for Israel \u2014 and antipathy toward Iran \u2014 against the MAGA base's fear that the U.S. will be drawn into a new foreign war.",
    "story": [
      "As the percussion of Israeli munitions rattled Tehran on Thursday night, President Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA movement observed a rare silence \u2014 a sign, influential Republicans say, of the divide within their own party when it comes to the prospect of a war between Israel and Iran.",
      "It took Trump, who comments publicly more often than any president in recent memory, about 10 hours to put out a statement on his Truth Social platform, in which he urged Iran to give up its nuclear weapons program.",
      "The first official U.S. assessment had been issued by the White House under Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s name, and it emphasized that America was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the strikes.",
      "But three U.S. officials told NBC News later Friday that the U.S. is assisting in shooting down Iranian missiles and projectiles targeting Israel. The Pentagon also moved a number of military assets into the region in recent days to support the operation, according to another U.S. official.",
      "In the meantime, Charlie Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, polled his 5 million X followers on the question of whether America should \u201cget involved in Israel\u2019s war against Iran.\u201d By Friday afternoon, the poll showed more than 350,000 votes, with an overwhelming proportion in the \u201cNo\u201d column.",
      "When Kirk read Rubio\u2019s statement on the strikes during a podcast Thursday night, Jack Posobiec, a right-wing activist popular with the MAGA audience, interjected that it was \u201cnot a supportive statement at all.\u201d Earlier Thursday, before the strikes, Posobiec had warned on X that a \u201cdirect strike on Iran right now would disastrously split the Trump coalition.\u201d",
      "And Steve Bannon, host of the \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast, which is influential with MAGA adherents within the administration and outside of it, steered clear of public commentary Thursday night.",
      "It all adds up to a demonstration of the quandary facing Trump as he and other elected Republicans seek safe political turf.",
      "Trump\u2019s electoral success owes in no small part to his isolationist-leaning \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform and his fierce criticism of drawn-out U.S. engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan that were launched by Republican President George W. Bush and continued by Democratic President Barack Obama.",
      "But Israel\u2019s latest action pits traditional Republican support for the Jewish state \u2014 and antipathy toward Iran \u2014 against the MAGA base\u2019s fear that the U.S. will be drawn into a new foreign war. And even within Trump\u2019s MAGA wing, there\u2019s a long-running split over  American backing of Israel. Trump has always been on the pro-Israel side of the divide.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are a pro-Israel party, and the president hasn\u2019t wavered on that,\u201d said one longtime Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity within the MAGA movement. \u201cI think the challenge here is not how to move forward. The question is how to sell that to the recalcitrant base.\u201d",
      "If Trump is able to do that, it will be despite powerful voices on the other side of the debate weighing in. Tucker Carlson, one of Trump's most influential supporters, wrote in his newsletter Friday that the U.S. should \"drop Israel.\"",
      "\"If Israel wants to wage this war, it has every right to do so. It is a sovereign country, and it can do as it pleases,\u201d Carlson wrote, according to Jewish Insider. \u201cBut not with America\u2019s backing.\u201d",
      "Israel launched its attack to forestall Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon and perhaps pressure Tehran into giving up that goal. Trump has been trying to construct a new version of an Obama-era nuclear deal that he shredded during his first term, and he articulated his hope Friday that Israel\u2019s campaign will help serve as a catalyst for Iran to sign a new pact. But it is not at all clear that the fighting won\u2019t have the opposite effect and spark a broader war between the two Middle Eastern powers.",
      "That\u2019s a showdown that establishment Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have been itching for.",
      "\u201cGame on,\u201d Graham \u2014 whose hawkish worldview predates the rise of the MAGA movement \u2014 wrote on X on Thursday night as video of explosions in Tehran bounced around the world.",
      "On the other side of the spectrum, Infowars host Owen Shroyer, one of the hundreds of people pardoned by Trump in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, posted a video to X that framed the new conflict as an existential question for the president\u2019s base.",
      "\u201cAmerica, the Trump movement, MAGA \u2014 however you want to say it, there\u2019s going to be a lot of soul-searching as these events go on, because a lot of MAGA is anti-war,\u201d Shroyer said. \u201cWhat good is \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 if we can\u2019t even be isolated from this war-torn region of the world, if we can\u2019t even be isolated from these foreign countries and these foreign conflicts that are just filled with hate?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never be able to make America great again,\u201d he added, \u201cas long as we\u2019re entangled in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "With Trump signaling approval for how Israel conducted strikes while cajoling Iran to make a deal Friday morning, some of the president\u2019s MAGA faithful seemed to settle on a narrative that U.S. involvement is acceptable to a point: troops on the ground.",
      "On a call with reporters Friday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asserted his own opposition to U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts while expressing confidence that Trump feels the same.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to support our ally, which we\u2019re doing, and we should do, unequivocally,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to provide them with arms for their own self-defense, which we have done and should do. But I can\u2019t imagine a world in which we would send United States troops, in which we would be involved in any kinetic activity, as the defense people like to say, there in the region, unless it\u2019s just defending our own installations.\u201d",
      "Israeli airstrikes on Iran are a far cry from American troops invading a nation that has been far more vulnerable to internal revolution than foreign conquest over the course of thousands of years of existence. Even the Republicans who are most aggressive when it comes to Iran talk about missiles and bombs rather than staging an incursion with American ground forces.",
      "But drawing a line on that is a middle ground that may satisfy most, if not all, Trump supporters for the moment.",
      "In the hours after the strikes, Trump allies hewed closely to the administration\u2019s sparse talking points.",
      "Alex Bruesewitz, a Republican consultant with close ties to the White House, shared Rubio\u2019s statement on X, emphasizing that the \u201cUS WAS NOT INVOLVED IN STRIKES AGAINST IRAN.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Laura Loomer, the right-wing conspiracy theorist aligned with Trump, posted several messages supportive of Trump and Israel.",
      "\u201cIran,\u201d Loomer wrote, \u201cmust never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Mehek Cooke, an attorney and pro-Trump political commentator active in the MAGA movement, said Friday that her recent visit to Israel opened her eyes to the \u201cdevastation of Iran\u2019s Oct. 7 proxy war\u201d there.",
      "Israel\u2019s strikes, Cooke added, \u201cwere not just justified; they were inevitable. This matters to every American, including the MAGA movement. You can\u2019t negotiate with regimes chanting \u2018Death to America.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cooke also pointed to recent polling from Rasmussen, a right-leaning firm, that found that 57% of respondents favored U.S. military action to combat Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. She said she believes MAGA loyalists will \u201cremain united\u201d behind Trump.",
      "\u201cMAGA wants peace, but we\u2019re not blind,\u201d Cooke added. \u201cYes, some in MAGA lean isolationist. But appeasement is not an option. Iran\u2019s leaders just threatened both Israel and the U.S., bringing us to a dangerous tipping point. Trump\u2019s 60-day deadline \u2014 blatantly ignored by Iran was followed by real consequences.\u201d",
      "Still, the political perils of taking sides in the early stages of what Israel says could be a sustained campaign were underscored by the reluctance of some MAGA figures to deal with the question head-on.",
      "Asked to explain the tension within the MAGA movement, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a close Trump ally, texted: \u201cMAGA is more concerned with the Battle for Los Angeles,\u201d where Trump has deployed the National Guard and Marines in a standoff with Americans protesting against immigration raids, \u201cthan the Battle for Tehran.\u201d",
      "What the White House appears to be most concerned about, at least in terms of Trump\u2019s domestic politics, is portraying the U.S. as uninvolved in the Middle East conflict.",
      "The word that trickled out overnight from the White House, and from a phone interview Trump gave to Fox News, emphasized that U.S. military had no role in the strikes.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until Friday morning that Trump weighed in directly \u2014 and ominously.",
      "\u201cThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!\u201d"

      "Were Israel to launch a unilateral strike against Iran, it would be a dramatic break with the Trump administration, which has argued against such a step. The Trump administration is awaiting a response from Iran about a proposed framework of a nuclear deal, and Trump has publicly said Tehran has become more hard-line in its negotiations.",
      "If Israel does carry out any operations against Iran, they would be conducted without any U.S. military assistance, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. But the official did not rule out U.S. intelligence support being provided to Israel.",
      "The notion of a new front in a simmering conflict has prompted the Trump administration to order all embassies within striking distance of Iranian missiles, aircraft and other assets (including missions in the Middle East, Northern Africa and Eastern Europe) to send cables with assessments about danger and about measures to mitigate risks to Americans and U.S. infrastructure, according to two sources familiar with the matter.",
      "U.S. and other officials are on alert awaiting the possibility of Israel\u2019s striking Iran, the officials said.",
      "The White House has not briefed senior lawmakers on the issue, according to that aide and a U.S. official.",
      "One major concern is Iran\u2019s retaliating against U.S. personnel or assets in the region for any action.",
      "Israel, which relies on intelligence or other direct and logistical assistance from the United States, may be in a position to take unilateral action against Tehran, said the source familiar with the matter. The sources and officials were not aware of any planned U.S. involvement in the possible action. The United States could support with aerial refueling or intelligence sharing rather than kinetic support, but the sources and officials were not aware of plans for that, either, at this point.",
      "U.S. officials have announced the voluntary departure of nonessential employees from the region. And the Defense Department announced the voluntary departure of military families from locations all across the U.S. Central Command area of operations.",
      "The CENTCOM commander, Gen. Erik Kurilla, was due to testify on Capitol Hill on Thursday, but the hearing was postponed late Wednesday without explanation. A source said Kurilla had to focus on this unfolding situation.",
      "Another possible factor: Iran is rebuilding its strategic air defenses, and manned strikes will soon be exponentially more dangerous for Israeli pilots. In October, Israel damaged nearly every one of Iran\u2019s strategic air defense systems (mainly S-300s), but much of the damage was to the radars or other parts that can be rebuilt. It is possible Israel\u2019s window for manned strikes, without being threatened by Iran\u2019s coordinated strategic air defenses, is closing.",
      "While Israel would most likely prefer U.S. military and intelligence support for strikes \u2014 especially against Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 it showed in October that it can do a lot alone.",
      "Michael Knights of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said the evacuation of nonessential staff members at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq will send a message to Tehran that Trump will not necessarily hold Israel back from launching a threatened attack on Iran.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about trying to get Iran to respect the president\u2019s wishes,\u201d Knights said.",
      "Iran has failed to meet a two-month deadline Trump set to reach an agreement on the country\u2019s nuclear activities, and he is frustrated, he said.",
      "Both Knights and a source with knowledge of the matter said it was unclear whether Israel would undertake a limited military strike now or wait until nuclear negotiations played out further.",
      "Trump has expressed growing frustration over Iran\u2019s stance at recent indirect talks, portraying Tehran as inflexible and slow-moving.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re just asking for things that you can\u2019t do. They don\u2019t want to give up what they have to give up,\u201d Trump told reporters Monday. \u201cThey seek enrichment. We can\u2019t have enrichment.\u201d"
