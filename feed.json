      "\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Anderson\u2019s ultracontemporary opus signifies a major gamble by Warner Bros. With \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d the studio is making a $130 million-plus bet that audiences would come out for 170-minute-long powerhouse drama from one of cinema\u2019s most celebrated auteurs the way they usually only turn up for a franchise or superhero movie.",
      "Anderson, many critics said, delivered the movie of year. \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor and Sean Penn, has been hailed as a film brimming with many of the political conflicts of today. Oscar prognosticators have pegged it this year\u2019s best-picture front-runner. Aided by DiCaprio\u2019s drawing power, the film added $26.1 million overseas.",
      "But good reviews, star power and a marquee filmmaker are nowadays often insufficient to make a hit. For a movie that cost at least $130 million to make, plus many millions more to market, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will have a long road to reach profitability. For most releases with such a high budget, a $22.4 million start would be a disappointment.",
      "Executives for Warner Bros. declined to be interviewed about the opening.",
      "Yet \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d like movies from earlier movie eras, will hope its time in theaters is more about the long run than opening weekend. Warners is hoping word-of-mouth, awards conversation and a rolling awareness that \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is a major movie event, will keep ticket sales strong in the weeks, or even months, to come.",
      "Some signs suggest that\u2019s possible. Audiences gave \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore. That\u2019s far better than CinemaScores for previous Anderson wide releases, including 1997\u2019s \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d (\u201cC\u201d), 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia\u201d (\u201cC-\u201d) and 2002\u2019s \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d (\u201cD+).",
      "\u201cThe long-term playability is going to be key for this,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cAnd given the outpouring of support by critics and audiences, alike, that's where it's going to make back its budget.\u201d",
      "Yet as highly regarded as Anderson is, his films have rarely made a big impact at the box office. His biggest hit was 2007\u2019s \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d which collected $76.4 million worldwide.",
      "For Warner Bros., \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d marked its ninth movie this year to open No. 1, more than any other studio. That success \u2014 with $4 billion in global sales \u2014 has included some refreshingly original films that haven\u2019t always made their most obvious way into theaters.",
      "Warners released Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d in April, and it went on to gross $366.7 million worldwide. \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d chose to opt out of the usual fall festival platforms for prestige films, and first screened while most critics were in Venice or Toronto. Yet \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will likely be favorites for many of the same prizes in the coming awards season.",
      "Anderson\u2019s film, loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d stars DiCaprio as a former revolutionary living off the grid with his teenage daughter (Chase Infiniti). Shot in VistaVision, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d played in several large-screen formats, including 70mm, IMAX, 70mm and, on four screens, in VistaVision.",
      "Second place went \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie.\u201d The Universal Pictures release, produced by DreamWorks Animation, grossed $13.5 million in 3,500 theaters. It\u2019s a good start for the G-rated film, based on the long-running series. \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie,\u201d which cost $32 million to make, also earned an \u201cA+\u201d CinemaScore from audiences.",

      "A new poll finds that younger adults are more likely to use subtitles while watching TV or movies than are older adults",
      "NEW YORK -- Taylor Heine, 35, is often multitasking when she watches TV shows or movies at home. \u201cI\u2019ll be playing on the phone, loving on my animals, maybe cleaning, picking up,\u201d she says.",
      "So she watches with the subtitles turned on.",
      "\u201cThat way I can kind of switch back and forth, be able to listen to it or look back at the screen and I know what\u2019s going on, Heine says.\u201d She can also catch up if she misses a piece of dialogue.",

      "\"When he\u2019s cooking or banging around in the kitchen, that way I don\u2019t have to blare the TV,\" she says.",

Some people find them distracting, and even family members in the same household can be in disagreement, resulting in tussles for the remote. But Heine, who lives in Johnson City, Tennessee, is in good company, according to a new survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research: People under age 45 are more likely to use them than older adults.",
      "The poll finds that about 4 in 10 adults under 45 use subtitles at least \u201coften\u201d when watching TV or movies, compared with about 3 in 10 adults older than 45. Those 60 and older are especially likely to say they \u201cnever\u201d use subtitles.",
      "The poll suggests many young adults use subtitles because they are watching in noisy environments, whereas older adults choose them to better hear or understand what is being said.",
      "That makes sense to David Barber, a sound editor and mixer and president of the Motion Picture Sound Editors.",
      "\u201cPart of it is cultural,\u201d Barber says. \u201cWhat the younger kids are doing is, a lot of them will multitask. They\u2019ll listen to music while they\u2019re watching a show. So they\u2019re catching bits and pieces of this, bits and pieces of that. I think they probably are half-listening and half-watching. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon.\u201d",
      "Many people, regardless of age, use closed captions simply to better catch dialogue.",
      "Most subtitle-users, 55%, say they use closed captions because they want to catch every word. About 4 in 10 say they do so because of difficulty understanding accents or because they are watching a foreign movie or show.",
      "Ariaunna Davis, 21, says she typically uses subtitles if she is in an environment where she cannot hear the audio and does not want to blast the volume, or if she cannot understand a character\u2019s accent.",
      "\u201cIf I want to know most of the words that are being said and the audio\u2019s a bit iffy, then that\u2019s the moment I\u2019ll mostly use captions,\u201d she says.",
      "Adrian Alaniz, 31, of Midland, Texas, thinks his hearing was slightly damaged by the concerts he attended when he was younger. With subtitles, he can be sure he is understanding what is going on, particularly if he is eating something crunchy like a bag of chips.",
      "In the animated shows Alaniz watches, the subtitles are particularly helpful for translation. There have been times, he says, when dubbed audio and subtitles do not match. \u201cSometimes the audio doesn\u2019t come across as clearly and the subtitles do help in that matter,\u201d he says.",

      "About one-quarter of subtitle users say they turn on captions because they are watching while multitasking. Fewer say the reason is a hearing impairment, trying to learn a new language or watching with the sound off.",
      "Ask a younger or older adult, though, and you could get a very different justification.",
      "Young adults who have used subtitles are more likely than those 45 and older to say they do this because they are watching in a noisy environment or watching while multitasking. Older subtitle users \u2014 those 45 and older \u2014 are more likely than younger adults to say they use closed captions because they have difficulty understanding accents or because of a hearing impairment.",

The Vermont-based singer also records and tours with the band The New Pornographers.

      "Brett Goldstein explores complex relationships in the new film \u201cAll of You,\u201d streaming on Apple TV+ Friday",
      "Brett Goldstein might want to break your heart. Or at least give you a proper ugly cry.",
      "In the new film \u201cAll of You,\u201dstreaming on Apple TV+ Friday, audiences are presented with a sticky conundrum: What if your soulmate, and your best friend, were different people?",
      "Reactions might differ about the choices Simon (Goldstein) and Laura (Imogen Poots) make in the film, which is a kind of rom-com-dram, if you will. But one thing Goldstein has noticed is that a lot of people who see it think that it\u2019s about them.",
      "\u201cI think everyone has this friendship,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in their life that is not their partner that they have a connection that feels more than friends, but what is that? What is love? And does it take away from the other? We just wanted to explore all of that over time.\u201d",
      "The idea came out of a getting to know you conversation with William Bridges, an Emmy winner for \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d whose episodes include \u201cUSS Callister.\" He co-wrote the film with Goldstein, and directed. At the time of the chat, Goldstein was single. Bridges was not. And Goldstein asked him if the woman he was seeing was \u201cthe one.\u201d It got them thinking about the idea of a soulmate test, something that could just take all the guesswork, all the bad dates, all the lost time, out of the equation.",
      "\u201cAll of You\u201d begins with a moment of truth as Simon accompanies Laura, his best friend from university, on her way to take the test. He even pays for it, and soon enough she\u2019s off making plans with a husband to be.",
      "Though the film has a bit of a science fiction element to it, it\u2019s decidedly less dystopian than a \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Some, like Laura, take the test. Some, like Simon, try to do it the old-fashioned way. But many are left wondering if they made the right choice. The film is told linearly, but skips over months and sometimes years in the saga of Laura and Simon.",

And I don\u2019t think you can vilify a person for sort of having them. It\u2019s just when they follow through it obviously complicates things.\u201d",
      "Part of the equation involved making sure that Laura\u2019s soulmate, and husband, wasn\u2019t easy to dismiss. Not only did they write him as kind, loving and a good father. They also cast a handsome Scottish actor, Steven Cree, to play him.",
      "\u201cOne thing we didn\u2019t want to do that I think romantic comedies do a lot is they make the other guy boring or a (expletive)-head. So you\u2019re going, \u2018Oh, obviously not him,\u2019\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cYou have to kind of stack the odds against all of them because that is more real and it\u2019s much more challenging, I think, for an audience because I think you are going \u2018I want this thing to happen and I also don\u2019t want this thing to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d was a kind of unintentional touchstone in thinking about the idea of friendships between straight men and women that only became clear to them after they made the film. An even less intentional reference was \u201cAtonement.\u201d Unbeknownst to the filmmakers, they set a pivotal scene between Laura and Simon in the same cottage on the English Channel in East Sussex that Joe Wright used for his classic tearjerker.",
      "While movie fans might bemoan the lack of the Nora Ephron-style romantic comedies of the 1990s on our screens, modern movies are grappling with the state of relationships in serious, satirical and genre-skewing ways, with films like \u201cMaterialists,\u201d\u201cSplitsville,\u201d \u201cAll of You\u201d and more. The distinction, Bridges said, is perhaps audiences today are craving stories not about aspirational, unattainable romance, but about love \u2014 however complicated and messy it might be.",
      "\u201cWe have seen the movie where somebody runs to the train station at the end and confesses undying love and the movie ends and the idea is they live happily ever after. But I\u2019m not quite sure that that\u2019s the experience of love that a lot of people have,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking for love stories rather than romance stories.\u201d",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Attorneys for the family of a man who died last week after riding a roller coaster at Universal Orlando Resort's newest theme park said Monday that they believe he smacked his head on a restraint during downward thrusts and was unconscious for most of the ride.",
      "The attorneys for the family of Kevin Rodriguez Zavala, 32, said the fact that he had a spinal disability from birth and used a wheelchair played no role in his death, and he had no medical issues before getting on the Stardust Racers ride at Epic Universe. At a news conference in Orlando, the lawyers also took issue with a top Universal executive last weekend saying in a note to employees that \u201cinternal findings\u201d showed the ride worked as it should have.",
      "\u201cThey are quick to say that, \u2018Well, the ride functioned as it was supposed to. Everything works properly.\u2019 Well, just because it didn\u2019t malfunction does not lead us to believe that there were not safety issues because we know something caused him to die,\u201d said famed civil rights attorney Ben Crump, whose law firm is representing the family.",
      "Zavala's family described him as a theme park enthusiast and a gamer with friends worldwide from gaming. He treasured his independence and drove and cooked for himself. He also worked as an employment counselor for people with disabilities, helping them land jobs and then checking on them once they started working. His parents said they never treated him any differently than his sister and brother because of his disability.",
      "\u201cHe was an extraordinary young man,\u201d said his father, Carlos Rodriguez.",
      "Karen Irwin, Universal Orlando Resort\u2019s president, said in her note that the internal findings showed ride systems functioned normally, equipment was intact and Universal workers followed the proper procedures.

      "Natalie Jackson, another of the family's attorneys, said they believe Zavala suffered repeated head strikes based on what witnesses have said. The family's attorneys said they have opened a line of communication with Universal officials, as the family seeks a full investigation into what happened and desires that the ride remain shuttered until there's an understanding of how Zavala died. They also are hiring a team of experts in ride design, safety, manufacturing and operations to guide their own investigation.",

      "Lear deBessonet, the new artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, has chosen \u201cRagtime\u201d as her first show",
      "NEW YORK -- When Lear deBessonet, the incoming artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, was thinking about what should be her first show as its new leader, she landed on something sweeping, very American \u2014 and some unfinished business.",
      "She had just directed an off-Broadway concert version of \u201cRagtime\u201d \u2014 a big, soaring musical celebrating early 20th-century America \u2014 that had wowed critics despite being a bare-boned production with some actors reading from their scripts. Might it fit the bill if she filled it out?",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re hoping is to make work that\u2019s going to be meaningful in people\u2019s lives, and I really felt that it was. And that it was in a way that wasn\u2019t finished,\u201d the Tony Award-nominated director says. \u201cIt really warranted the full flourishing of the idea.\u201d",
      "She gets her wish this fall as 33 actors buoyed by an 28-piece orchestra announce her arrival with a full-throated Broadway revival of the stage version of E.L. Doctorow\u2019s bestselling novel. Previews begin Friday; opening night is Oct. 16.",
      "\u201cRagtime'' is the story of three distinct groups of characters navigating their way through the turbulent racial and economic times of 1906 in New York City \u2014 a Jewish immigrant with his young daughter, a well-to-do white family and a Black piano player.",
      "\u201cBecause \u2018Ragtime\u2019 has, in fact, so many stories with multiple protagonists, there is an opportunity for people to connect with it in many different ways that reflect their own history, their own family\u2019s history, their own experience,\u201d she says.",
      "Tony Award-nominee Joshua Henry leads the cast and views it as the perfect musical for this moment. \u201cHow we see each other, how we hear each other is right now at the forefront,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI think \u2018Ragtime\u2019 puts the spotlight on how we have been successful and not successful doing that in the past, and I feel that\u2019s going to help us move forward.\u201d",
      "The revival is part of a slate of shows that deBessonet is crafting for the multi-Tony Award-winning, three-theater complex on the Lincoln Center campus, one that has built a reputation for new plays and sumptuous revivals of great musicals.",
      "\u201cThe work we make here I want it to be something that anyone of any background \u2014 whether they are visiting New York City or were born here \u2014 could come in and feel restored to humanity, feel connected to other people,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of why I\u2019m such a passionate advocate for the theater as an art form is, I really believe, it\u2019s a place where we can gather across difference.\u201d",
      "DeBessonet this season is also bringing over the London hit \u201cKyoto,\u201d a political thriller about the climate accords, and a revival of \u201cThe Whoopi Monologues\u201d with Kerry Washington and Kara Young. There also will be a family holiday opera and a comedy series in its rooftop off-Broadway venue.",

      "Henry has watched deBessonet cook \u2014 both leading an arts organization and directing a massive musical. He's talked to carpenters and electricians and people in the organization and says the mood is buoyant.",
      "\u201cThere are some people who have been there for decades and are now talking about just the breath of fresh air that her leadership is bringing,\u201d he says. \u201cIf this is any indication of what she\u2019s capable of, Lincoln Center is in phenomenal hands for years to come.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are an organization that supports great artists making great, complex, meaningful, thought-provoking works of art,\u201d she says. \u201cThere will be many different viewpoints that are expressed in the art.\u201d",

Now with \u201cRagtime\u201d she's taking a third musical to Broadway.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a story that really invites us to engage our complex, deep feelings about where we are now and where we have come from,\u201d deBessonet says. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the type of work that I think belongs at Lincoln Center Theater.\u201d",

      "Scarlett Johansson makes her directorial debut with \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d starring June Squibb",
      "There is a lovely story of friendship, grief and starting over at the heart of \u201cEleanor the Great.\u201d The film, directed by Scarlett Johansson in her feature debut, gets tangled in a plot contrivance that is, at best, unnecessary and at worst, loathsome.",
      "That\u2019s the problem with the elevator pitch mentality, though. A story about a 90-something trying to make friends in a new city might sound a little too simple, a little too straightforward. What if she does so by pretending to be a Holocaust survivor? I\u2019m not kidding.",
      "Eleanor is played by June Squibb (the great). At 94-years-old, she has moved from Florida to New York after the death of her best friend and roommate Bessie (Rita Zohar). Her daughter, Lisa (Jessica Hecht), and grandson, Max (Will Price), have taken her into their small Manhattan apartment, but they only seem interested in getting Eleanor into an assisted living arrangement. Lisa especially treats her mother's presence like an inconvenience, a problem to fix, and Eleanor starts looking elsewhere for companionship.",
      "The thing is Eleanor had a great life in Florida, living with her platonic best friend in a little apartment. The script, Tory Kamen\u2019s first produced screenplay, smartly introduces this idyllic moment first. It is a distinct joy to watch the two nonagenarians go about their daily activities, from velcroing their shoes to doing their exercises on the beach.",
      "Squibb recently had a version of this in the delightful \u201cThelma,\u201d but there she was alone, a widow determined to hold onto her independent living situation. Here, Bessie and Eleanor help each other, whether it\u2019s waking up on time, or standing up for the other at the local supermarket when their preferred brand of kosher pickles isn\u2019t on the shelf and the teenage employee dares to suggest that \u201call pickles taste the same.\u201d Then Bessie suddenly dies, and Eleanor is left with no choice but to start over.",
      "It\u2019s hard to make new friends anywhere, at any age, but perhaps even more so in drizzly, cold New York. When a friendly woman at the Jewish Community Center asks Eleanor if she\u2019s here for \u201cthe group,\u201d Eleanor doesn\u2019t question it. Yes, she says with a relieved smile. When it becomes clear that this group is for Holocaust survivors, she does try to leave, but everyone encourages her to stay and suddenly she\u2019s telling Bessie\u2019s story of losing her brother in Poland as her own. The script has already established Eleanor as a bit of a liar \u2014 but they\u2019re the small kinds, the white lies that, she says, aren\u2019t hurting anyone.",

      "Nina has recently lost her mother and finds solace in this relationship. It\u2019s here where you can start to see how the rest of the movie is going to play out, how the lie will go on too long and be exposed at a terrible time, leading to inevitable feelings of betrayal and humiliation. And it is very, very hard to watch Squibb in distress. Rather than celebrate the performance you want to lash out at the script that put her in this situation in the first place. That may not be fair but it\u2019s also true.",
      "The story becomes less of a character study of the strange ways in which grief manifests and more about the escalating hijinks of a lie that takes on a wild life of its own. Soon Eleanor is speaking to Nina\u2019s journalism peers in an on-the-record, taped conversation, telling another of Bessie\u2019s stories. Then, Nina\u2019s distant father ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ), a local news anchor, decides Eleanor\u2019s is a great human-interest story for his show.",
      "There is a thread about the merits of preserving memory, but it\u2019s introduced a little too late and too flimsily to justify all that came before it. Johansson directs the proceedings simply, like a classic New York character drama, allowing the performances to shine over the filmmaking, but who she is as a filmmaker remains to be seen. Squibb and Kellyman, both terrific, are the real reasons to seek out \u201cEleanor the Great.\u201d The film may trip over its own contrivances but their performances will leave you moved.",
      "\u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d a Sony Pictures Classics release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csome language, thematic elements and suggestive references.\u201d Running time: 98 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "Cuban teenagers Fabio and Diego Abreu are part of a new wave of musicians revitalizing Cuba\u2019s music scene",
      "HAVANA -- Cuban teenagers Fabio and Diego Abreu seem shy at first, but the moment they step on stage, they become confident, filling a concert hall in downtown Havana with a hypnotic form of traditional jazz.",
      "The Abreu brothers, aged 19 and 17, are part of a new generation of musicians revitalizing Cuba\u2019s music scene. They are filling a void left by established performers who have emigrated or stayed abroad as the island endures one of its most dire economic crises in decades. Their rise is also fueled by the opening of small, private venues for their shows and the relatively recent spread of internet access on the island, which they use for promotion.",
      "\u201cWe do what we like and we\u2019re fortunate enough to make a living from what we love, which is music,\u201d 19-year-old Fabio Abreu said shortly before a concert at the F\u00e1brica de Arte Cubano, a sprawling cultural center housed in a former factory that now operates as an art gallery, music venue and nightclub.",
      "And it's not just good old traditional jazz like that of the Abreus. Young musicians in Cuba are experimenting with everything, mixing traditional Cuban music like timba and salsa with newer, more daring sounds like electronic music and hip hop.",
      "The Cuban music scene is both complex and interesting, said Michel Hern\u00e1ndez, a writer and journalist specialized in music. \u201cThe recent migration of major Cuban artists \u2014 many with established careers \u2014 has created a void that is now being filled by a new generation of musicians,\u201d he said.",
      "The emerging scene is highly hybrid, he said, blending rock, pop and electronic music with traditional Afro-Cuban music styles such as \u201cson,\u201d which is the root of salsa. The phenomenon has led to the rise of new genres, including the highly commercial \u201creparto,\" a genre that originated in Havana\u2019s working-class neighborhoods and is known for its explicit lyrics.",
      "In addition to new sounds, many of these artists are now performing in small, private bars that have opened over the last decade. And lacking a formal record industry, young Cuban artists rely heavily on social media and the internet \u2014 a tool only widely available on the island since late 2018. They also depend on music videos, some of which are made with very low production budgets, that are shared between phones.",
      "One of them is Melanie Santiler, a 23-year-old pop singer and songwriter who has gained a following among young people. She credits online videos for much of her success. Her Instagram account boasts 248,000 followers, while her YouTube channel has 73,000.",
      "\u201cWe emerging musicians are the ones carrying the flag and shaping the future of Cuban music,\" she said. \u201cFor me, this is a decisive moment.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers for music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs urged a New York federal judge Monday to sentence him early next month to no more than 14 months in prison for his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, meaning he'd go free almost immediately if the judge agreed.",
      "The lawyers made their arguments in a written submission to Judge Arun Subramanian, who has already rejected a proposed $50 million bail package, signaling that he doesn't believe the Grammy-winning artist is close to being released.",
      "\u201cMr. Combs\u2019s celebrity status in the realms of music, fashion, spirits, media, and finance has been shattered and Mr. Combs\u2019s legacy has been destroyed,\u201d the lawyers wrote, saying their client has been punished enough.",
      "The submission provided new information about what life behind bars for nearly 13 months has been like for Combs, what's happened to his businesses and other interests and explains why he turned down a plea-deal offer from prosecutors prior to his trial.",
      "Combs faces an Oct. 3 sentencing after his July conviction by a Manhattan jury on two Mann Act charges that outlaw interstate commerce related to prostitution. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The Bad Boy Records founder was exonerated on more serious racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that would have required a minimum of 15 years in prison and the possibility of a life sentence.",
      "In their submission, Combs' lawyers argued that a jury sent a loud message to the judge by exonerating him of the most serious charges.",
      "\u201cPut simply, the jury has spoken. Its verdict represents an \u2018affirmative indication of innocence,\u2019\u201d the lawyers said.",
      "\u201cHe has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America \u2014 yet has made the most of that punishment. It is time for Mr. Combs to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life,\u201d they added.",
      "Prosecutors, who will submit their recommendations prior to the Oct. 3 sentencing, have already said they\u2019ll urge Combs stay imprisoned substantially longer than the four to five years they originally thought.",
      "Defense lawyers, though, wrote in their submission Monday that prosecutors \u201chave lost all perspective.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Combs\u2019s career and reputation have been destroyed,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHis life outside of jail has been systematically dismantled.\u201d",
      "Among other things, they noted that he had to let go over 100 employees from his businesses and many of them have been unable to get new jobs because of their past association with Combs.",
      "His seven children, they said, have faced \u201cdevastating consequences,\u201d including lost business opportunities in acting, television, fashion and concerts, with some of them being included in some of the nearly 100 civil lawsuits filed against Combs since his arrest.",
      "The lawyers also noted that Combs and his family were set to star in a Hulu show about their lives, but the show was cancelled once the allegations against him became public.",
      "Combs was removed from the boards at three charter schools he created in Harlem, the Bronx and Connecticut and was stripped of an honorary doctorate degree from Howard University, which plans to return his prior donations, they said.",

      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Australian scientists tested the strength of bite-resistant wetsuits by allowing sharks to chomp the materials at sea and found that the suits can help keep swimmers safe.",
      "Fatal shark bites are vanishingly rare, with less than 50 unprovoked shark bites on humans worldwide in 2024, according to the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History. But increased sightings of large sharks in some parts of the world have swimmers, surfers and divers looking for new ways to stay safe.",
      "Scientists with Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia, tested four bite-resistant materials and found they all reduced the amount of damage from shark bites. They performed the work by dragging samples of the materials behind boats and allowing white and tiger sharks to bite the samples.",
      "The bites from such large sharks can still cause internal and crushing injuries, but the materials showed effectiveness beyond a standard neoprene wetsuit, the scientists said. The research found that the bite-resistant materials \u201ccan reduce injuries sustained from shark encounters,\u201d said Flinders professor Charlie Huveneers, a member of the Southern Shark Ecology Group at Flinders and a study co-author.",
      "\"Bite-resistant material do not prevent shark bites, but can reduce injuries from shark bites and can be worn by surfers and divers,\" Huveneers said.",
      "There were small differences between the four tested materials, but they all \"reduced the amount of substantial and critical damage, which would typically be associated with severe hemorrhaging and tissue or limb loss,\u201d said Tom Clarke, a researcher with the science and engineering college at Flinders and a study co-author.",
      "Chainmail suits to resist shark bites have existed for decades, but lack in flexibility for aquatic activities like surfing and diving, the scientists said in research published in the journal Wildlife Research on Thursday. Newer wetsuits can be designed to provide flexibility as well as protection.",

That includes surfers and spearfishers, he said.",

      "\u201cI also like it because it's not relying on any impact on the shark's behavior,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cIt's basically very, very simple. In the extremely rare event that you get bitten by a shark, this material will hopefully make you bleed less than you would if you were not wearing this.\u201d",
      "The researchers said the suits do not eliminate all risks from sharks, and precautions still need to be taken around the animals.",

      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's program that provides health insurance to some low-income adults that document work or other activities has been extended for 15 months by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp announced Thursday that the federal government approved that the Pathways to Coverage program will continue as part of the state-federal Medicaid program through December 2026. The five-year pilot program had been scheduled to expire next week, but Kemp argued Georgia should get more time because the program only started after a court battle with President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, which tried to shut it down.",
      "Georgia's program has been closely watched because Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the country as part of the tax and budget overhaul signed into law by Trump. Starting in 2027, some adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "The Georgia program, which has similar work or activity requirements, has enrolled far fewer people than originally projected, covering 9,175 people as of August. It has spent twice as much on administrative costs than on providing actual health care. The Kemp administration had projected it would cover 25,000 people in its first year and up to 100,000 eventually.",
      "Critics warn the Georgia experience shows that millions will lose coverage under the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to document their work. Republicans have defended the low enrollment, saying Medicaid should be temporary for people who can get insurance through an employer.",
      "Pathways is Kemp's answer to pressure to expand Medicaid to cover all adults who earn less than 138% of federal poverty line wages, as originally envisioned under President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul. Georgia is one of 10 Republican-led states that refused to expand coverage. Instead, Kemp launched Pathways, offering coverage to people who earn up to the poverty line \u2014 $15,650 a year. Georgia\u2019s traditional Medicaid program still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a few other very poor adults.",
      "Under the extension, Georgia will offer health coverage to parents and guardians of children younger than six without any additional work requirement. The state will also let beneficiaries report qualifying work or activity hours only once a yearly, instead of monthly. Some beneficiaries had said the monthly reporting process was glitchy and hard to use. Insurance will also start on the first day of the month that an application is received, meaning hospitals and doctors will have an incentive to help uninsured patients apply in hopes of getting paid for care already delivered. Right now, coverage doesn't start until after someone is approved.",

The administrative portion declined more recently, from 96.5% in fiscal year 2023 to 58.8% in fiscal year 2024. It is expected to drop more in 2025.",

      "It is the first Ebola outbreak in 18 years in Kasai province, a remote part of Congo characterized by its poor road networks. It is located more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the nation\u2019s capital of Kinshasa.",
      "\u201cWe urgently need our partners and donors to step up and support this lifesaving response to ensure we can contain the outbreak quickly and protect the most vulnerable communities,\u201d said Susan Nzisa Mbalu, head of communications for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Africa, IFRC.",
      "Earlier this week, the IFRC said it is appealing for 20 million Swiss francs ($25 million) to help contain the outbreak and aiming to reach 965,000 people with urgent assistance. It warned that health facilities are overwhelmed and lack the resources to provide care, with clean water and protective equipment running critically low.",
      "According to the IFRC, the only treatment centre in the Bulape health zone, where the epicenter of the outbreak has been declared and the majority of cases are concentrated, is already at 119% capacity.",

      "IFRC\u2019s Nzisa Mbalu said it is still early to fully assess the level of donor support for the Ebola response, adding that the organization has so far allocated 1.75 million swiss francs ($2.2 million) in emergency funds to respond to the outbreak.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin will stop scheduling patients for abortions starting next week as it works to find a way to provide the service in the face of Medicaid funding cuts in President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, the nonprofit said Thursday.",
      "Abortion funding across the U.S. has been under siege, particularly Planned Parenthood affiliates, which are the biggest provider.",
      "The organization warned earlier this year that about half its clinics that provide abortion could be closed as a result of a ban on Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood for services other than abortion.",
      "The measure was part of the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. Initially, a judge said reimbursements must continue, but a federal appeals court this month said the government could halt the payments while a court challenge to the provision moves ahead.",
      "Planned Parenthood services include cancer screenings and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment. Federal Medicaid money was already not paying for abortion, but affiliates relied on Medicaid to stay afloat.",
      "The remaining Planned Parenthood clinics in Louisiana \u2013 where abortion is banned \u2013 are scheduled to shut down at the end of this month.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said in a statement that it is trying to see as many patients as possible between now and Tuesday. The federal law takes effect Wednesday. It is not scheduling patients beyond that date and the organization believes the move will allow it to continue seeing other Medicaid patients. The organization said it was working with providers across the state to make sure patients are referred quickly and receive timely care.",
      "It is also considering taking legal action, the group said.",
      "\u201cPlanned Parenthood of Wisconsin will continue to provide the full spectrum of reproductive health care, including abortion, as soon and as we are able to,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin President and CEO Tanya Atkinson said in the statement. \u201cIn the meantime, we are pursuing every available option through the courts, through operations, and civic engagement.\u201d",
      "The abortion landscape has been shifting frequently since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2022 that allowed states to ban abortion. Currently, 12 states do not allow it at any stage of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four more ban it after about six weeks\u2019 gestation.",
      "The bans have resulted in more women traveling for abortion and an increased reliance on abortion pills. Prescribers in states where they\u2019re allowed have been shipping the pills to places where abortion is banned, a practice that is facing some legal challenges and is expected to attract more.",

      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin stopped providing abortions after that ruling for 15 months before resuming them as the lawsuit over the state law played out. It has been providing abortions at three clinics in Wisconsin for the past two years.",

Yet when nations' leaders give the U.N. their annual take on big issues, drugs don't usually get much of the spotlight.",

      "While the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, climate change and other crises got much of the focus in the U.N.'s marathon week of speeches and meetings, the topic of drugs turned up from Trump's and Petro's tough talk to side events on such themes as gender-inclusive drug policy and international cooperation to fight organized crime.",
      "Some 316 million people worldwide used marijuana, opioids and/or other drugs in 2023, a 28% rise in a decade, according to the most recent statistics available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. The figures don\u2019t count alcohol or tobacco use.",

      "Now 52 and living in Denmark, Petersen recalled being told she had been fitted with the device before leaving the hospital.",
      "\u201cBecause of my age, I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said tearfully. \u201cI kept it inside me and never talked about it.\u201d",
      "Petersen said her trauma led to \u201canger, depression, and too much to drink,\" as she suppressed memories of her experiences and didn\u2019t speak about it with doctors.",
      "Later in life, after she married, she was unable to have children.",
      "At a ceremony in Greenland 's capital of Nuuk on Wednesday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen will offer their official apologies for their governments' roles in the mistreatment of Greenlandic Indigenous girls and women who were given invasive contraception by the Danish health authorities against their will, with cases dating back to the 1960s.",
      "\u201cWe cannot change what has happened, but we can take responsibility and we can create the conditions for reconciliation with the past,\u201d Frederiksen said in a statement released Monday, adding the Danish government intends to establish a reconciliation fund to financially compensate victims.",
      "Last month, Denmark and Greenland already published apologies for their roles in the mistreatment of the women and girls just ahead of the publication of an independent investigation into the abuse.",
      "The event comes at a difficult time with U.S. President Donald Trump exploiting divisions between Denmark and Greenland as it seeks U.S. influence, even jurisdiction over the territory.",
      "Meanwhile, Denmark has sought to placate the independence movement in Greenland but historical abuses committed by the former colonial power have tainted their efforts at a rapprochement.",
      "Greenland, which remains part of the Danish realm, was a colony under Denmark\u2019s crown until 1953, when it became a province in the Scandinavian country. In 1979, the island was granted home rule, and 30 years later Greenland became a self-governing entity.",
      "The forced contraception of Indigenous women and girls was part of centuries of Danish policies that dehumanized Greenlanders and their families.",

      "An independent investigation, published earlier this month, found Inuit victims, some 12 years old and younger, were either fitted with IUDs or given hormonal birth control injections. They were not told details about the procedure, nor did they give their consent.",
      "Some described traumatic experiences that left them with feelings of shame as well as physical side effects, from pain and bleeding to serious infections.",
      "While the report covered the experiences of 354 women who spoke with investigators, Danish authorities say more than 4,000 women and girls \u2014 reportedly half the fertile women in Greenland at the time \u2014 received IUDs between the 1960s and mid-1970s. It\u2019s not known how many of those cases lacked consent.",
      "\u201cOf course, I\u2019m thinking about all the women who were treated like I was,\u201d said Petersen, who had her IUD removed earlier this year, after not speaking about her experiences for over 30 years. \u201cI feel with my fellow women from this episode of our life.\u201d",
      "The alleged purpose of the forced contraception was to limit population growth in Greenland by preventing pregnancies. The population on the Arctic island was rapidly increasing at the time because of better living conditions and better health care. Greenland took over its own health care programs in 1992.",
      "Kirstine Berthelsen, 66, who now lives in Copenhagen, will attend Wednesday's event in Nuuk. She believes she was 14 when she was fitted with an IUD in Greenland.

      "For Berthelsen, now a retiree, the official apology comes at \u201cthe right time.\"",
      "\u201cI am ready for a reconciliation, because it will help me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will personally be a big event for me, and I\u2019m sure it will ease.\u201d",

      "Government scientists say infection rates from drug-resistant \u201cnightmare bacteria\u201d have been increasing dramatically",
      "NEW YORK -- Infection rates from drug-resistant \u201cnightmare bacteria\u201d rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.",
      "Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in an article published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said.",
      "Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.",
      "\u201cThe rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,\u201d said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.",
      "It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said.",
      "That may play out in doctors\u2019 offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat \u2014 like urinary tract infections \u2014 could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report\u2019s authors.",
      "Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise \u2014 unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn\u2019t kill the germs made them stronger.",
      "In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to \u201c nightmare bacteria \u201d resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.",
      "Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.",
      "They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.",
      "The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 \u2014 an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 \u2014 an increase of 460%, the authors said.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republican legislators are poised this week to approve criminal justice measures designed to toughen bail rules, restrict magistrates' powers and evaluate offenders' mental health after the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte commuter train. The bill also could help get the death penalty carried out again in the ninth-largest U.S. state.",
      "Senate and House Republicans unveiled legislation that their leaders previously signaled would surface when the General Assembly reconvened on Monday after nearly two months away from Raleigh.",
      "The Aug. 22 death of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska \u2014 her attack caught on camera \u2014 and subsequent charges against a suspect who had previously been arrested more than a dozen times caused public outrage. An array of Republicans, President Donald Trump among them, have attempted to blame Zarutska's death on Charlotte-area leaders and Democratic state officials for what they call soft-on-crime policies.",
      "The Senate approved the legislation 28-8 late Monday, with many Democrats absent from the otherwise party-line vote. The bill now goes to the House, where a vote is likely Tuesday.",
      "Any final measure would then go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein\u2019s desk. Stein, the former attorney general, has suggested pretrial release changes and greater emphasis on mental health are needed in light of Zarutska's death.",
      "But the measure took a different direction \u2014 away from bipartisan support \u2014 when Senate Republicans approved an amendment that could in the future open the door to other forms of capital punishment beyond lethal injection, which is currently the state\u2019s sole method. North Carolina last carried out an execution in 2006.",
      "The stabbing suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., could received a death sentence if convicted of first-degree murder in state court or a federal count filed against him.",
      "Brown, whose criminal record included serving more than five years in prison after pleading guilty to robbery using a deadly weapon, had been charged in January in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, with misusing the 911 system, a misdemeanor, according to court records.",
      "But a magistrate \u2014 a nonelected local court official who often determines if a defendant can be released while awaiting trial \u2014 released him on a written promise to return for court. And it took more than six months for a court to order a mental evaluation for him. Brown\u2019s mother told Charlotte-area television that she had sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment this year after he became violent at home.",
      "GOP Sen. Ralph Hise said the legislation has nothing to do with winning political points, but rather is a response to the failure of the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cWe need a criminal justice system that protects society from individuals. I believe these are many great steps in this bill,\u201d Hise said.",
      "The measure, named \u201cIryna\u2019s Law,\u201d would prohibit cashless bail for certain crimes and eliminate some of the discretion that magistrates and judges have for pretrial release decisions.",
      "For example, first-time defendants accused of a violent offense could only be released on a secured cash bond or receive house arrest with electronic monitoring. Such house arrest and monitoring would be the only option for some repeat defendants.",
      "The bill also attempts to ensure that more suspects are subject to psychological examinations before their potential release. Defendants accused of a violent crime and committed involuntarily in recent years to a mental health facility would be subject to a psychological evaluation.",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Keir Starmer never had much of a political honeymoon. Now some members of his political party are considering divorce.",
      "Little more than a year after winning power in a landslide, Britain\u2019s prime minister is fighting to keep the support of his party, and to fend off Nigel Farage, whose hard-right Reform UK has a consistent lead in opinion polls",
      "The next election is as much as four years away, but as thousands of Labour Party members gather Sunday for their annual conference beside the River Mersey in Liverpool, lawmakers are growing anxious. A potential leadership rival has emerged in Andy Burhnam, the ambitious mayor of Manchester.",
      "Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said the party's mood is \u201cfebrile.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve only been in government a year and they\u2019ve got a big majority, but most voters seem to be quite disappointed and disillusioned with the government,\" he said. \"And they also have a very low opinion of Keir Starmer.\u201d",

Inflation remains stubbornly high and the economic outlook subdued, frustrating efforts to repair tattered public services and ease the cost of living.",

Even though Britain managed to secure a trade deal easing import duties on some U.K. goods, the autumn budget statement in November looks set to be a grim choice between tax increases and spending cuts \u2013 maybe both.",
      "Starmer acknowledged on Friday that the government has to \u201cspeed up\u201d and do better. In his big conference speech on Tuesday, he\u2019ll try to set out a sweeping vision to energize Labour\u2019s grassroots, something critics say has been lacking under his managerial command. He\u2019ll also seek to persuade party members, and voters, that he has learned from his mistakes and stabilized a sometimes wobbly government.",

There have also been several exits from his backroom team, adding to a sense of disarray.",

More than 30,000 people have made the dangerous crossing from France so far this year despite efforts by authorities in Britain, France and other countries to crack down on people-smuggling gangs.",
      "Far-right activists have been involved in protests outside hotels housing asylum-seekers across the U.K., and a march organized by anti-immigration campaigner Tommy Robinson attracted more than 100,000 people in London this month.",
      "Starmer has acknowledged voters\u2019 concerns about migration but condemned Robinson\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric and accused Farage of sowing division.",
      "Farage\u2019s party has only five lawmakers in the 650 seat House of Commons, and Labour has more than 400. Nonetheless Starmer said Friday that Reform, and not the main opposition Conservatives, is now Labour\u2019s chief opponent.",
      "He said the defining political battle of our times is between a \u201cpolitics of predatory grievance\u201d that seeks to foster division and \u201cpatriotic renewal \u2026 underpinned by the values of dignity and respect, equality and fairness.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a battle for the soul of this country now as to what sort of country we want to be,\u201d he said.",

They may get the small boats problem under control over time.",

      "The United Nations has reimposed sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran early Sunday over its nuclear program, further squeezing the Islamic Republic as its people increasingly find themselves priced out of the food they need to survive and worried about their futures.",
      "After last-minute diplomacy failed at the U.N., the sanctions took effect Sunday at 0000 GMT (8 p.m. Eastern).",
      "The sanctions will again freeze Iranian assets abroad, halt arms deals with Tehran, and penalize any development of Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, among other measures. It came via a mechanism known as \u201csnapback,\u201d included in Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, and comes as Iran's economy already is reeling.",
      "Iran's rial currency sits at a record low, increasing pressure on food prices and making daily life that much more challenging. That includes meat, rice and other staples of the Iranian dinner table.",
      "Meanwhile, people worry about a new round of fighting between Iran and Israel \u2014 as well as potentially the United States \u2014 as missile sites struck during the 12-day war in June now appear to be being rebuilt.",
      "Activists fear a rising wave of repression within the Islamic Republic, which already has reportedly executed more people this year than over the past three decades.",
      "Sina, the father of a 12-year-old boy who spoke on condition that only his first name be used for fear of repercussions, said the country has never faced such a challenging time, even during the deprivations of the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and the decades of sanctions that came later.",
      "\u201cFor as long as I can remember, we\u2019ve been struggling with economic hardship, and every year it\u2019s worse than the last,\u201d Sina told The Associated Press. \u201cFor my generation, it\u2019s always either too late or too early \u2014 our dreams are slipping away.\u201d",
      "Snapback was designed to be veto-proof at the U.N. Security Council, meaning China and Russia could not stop it alone, as they have other proposed actions against Tehran in the past. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called them a \u201ctrap\u201d for Iran on Saturday.",
      "France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered snapback over Iran 30 days ago for its further restricting monitoring of its nuclear program and the deadlock over its negotiations with the U.S.",
      "Iran further withdrew from the International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring after Israel\u2019s war on the country in June, which also saw the U.S. strike nuclear sites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, the country still maintains a stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% purity \u2014 a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90% \u2014 that is largely enough to make several atomic bombs, should Tehran choose to rush toward weaponization.",
      "Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and IAEA say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003.",
      "Tehran has further argued that the three European nations shouldn\u2019t be allowed to implement snapback, pointing in part to America\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, during the first term of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration appears to think it has a stronger hand post-strikes, and it can wait for Iran to come back to the table,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, a nuclear expert at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. \u201cGiven the knowledge Iran has, given the materials that remain in Iran, that\u2019s a very dangerous assumption.\u201d",
      "Risks also remain for Iran as well, she added: \u201cIn the short term, kicking out the IAEA increases the risk of miscalculation. The U.S. or Israel could use the lack of inspections as a pretext for further strikes.\u201d",
      "Iran on Saturday recalled its ambassadors to France, Germany and the U.K. for consultations ahead of the sanctions being reimposed, the state-run IRNA news agency reported.",

      "The aftermath of the June war drove up food prices in Iran, putting already expensive meat out of reach for poorer families.",
      "Iran's government put overall annual inflation at 34.5% in June, and its Statistical Center reported that the cost of essential food items rose over 50% over the same period. But even that doesn't reflect what people see at shops. Pinto beans tripled in price in a year, while butter nearly doubled. Rice, a staple, rose more than 80% on average, hitting 100% for premium varieties. Whole chicken is up 26%, while beer and lamb are up 9%.",
      "\u201cEvery day I see new higher prices for cheese, milk and butter,\" said Sima Taghavi, a mother of two, at a Tehran grocery. \u201cI cannot omit them like fruits and meat from my grocery list because my kids are too young to be deprived.\u201d",
      "The pressure over food and fears about the war resuming have seen more patients heading to psychologists since June, local media in Iran have reported.",
      "\u201cThe psychological pressure from the 12-day war on the one hand, and runaway inflation and price hikes on the other, has left society exhausted and unmotivated,\u201d Dr. Sima Ferdowsi, a clinical psychologist and professor at Shahid Beheshti University, told the Hamshahri newspaper in an interview published in July.",
      "\u201cIf the economic situation continues like this, it will have serious social and moral consequences,\" she warned, with the newspaper noting \u201cpeople may do things they would never think of doing in normal circumstances to survive.\u201d",
      "Iran has faced multiple nationwide protests in recent years, fueled by anger over the economy, demands for women's rights and calls for the country's theocracy to change. The most recent came in 2022 over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died after being detained by police allegedly for not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to their liking.",
      "In response to those protests and the June war, Iran has been putting prisoners to death at a pace unseen since 1988, when it executed thousands at the end of the Iran-Iraq war. The Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights and the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran put the number of people executed in 2025 at over 1,000, noting the number could be higher as Iran does not report on each execution.",
      "\u201cPolitical and civic space in Iran has shrunk to nothing, and outside Iran, civil society activists and dissidents face transnational repression,\u201d the center warned. \u201cThe Iranian people, millions of whom aspire to more than a closed and brutal theocracy, have tried every option within their reach. Their leaders have not.\u201d",

      "The break would mean the consumer pays less value-added tax, while ensuring artisans are paid the same.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t pay them less because the artisans are already not being paid much,\u2019\u2019 Jean said, as she put finishing touches on runway models backstage. \u201cOtherwise we will see this craftsmanship only in museums. If we don\u2019t wear it, it is useless.\u2019\u2019",

      "It wasn't his first ship pull. Six years ago, he tried for two hours before he managed to pull a 4,000-ton ship in the water, a rope strapped to his shoulders, for about 30 meters (yards). The event was caught on video.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine\u2019s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant entered its fifth day running on emergency generators Saturday, prompting mounting safety concerns.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, announced a $90 billion arms agreement with the United States and criticized Hungary for carrying out \"dangerous\u201d intelligence-gathering drone activities over Ukraine.",
      "External power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, has been cut for more than four days in a record outage at the six-reactor facility on the front line of the war, Greenpeace Ukraine warned Saturday.",
      "Emergency diesel generators are being used to power cooling and safety systems after the final power line was severed on Tuesday, according to the U.N. nuclear watchdog. Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, but the external power supply was not restored.",
      "The reactor core and used nuclear fuel must be cooled to prevent them overheating and triggering dangerous meltdowns like the ones that occurred in 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami hit the Fukushima plant in Japan. The U.N. atomic watchdog has repeatedly warned of the possibility of a radiation catastrophe like the one at Chernobyl, about 480 kilometers (300 miles) to the northwest, where a reactor exploded in 1986.",
      "Ukrainian officials confirmed the severity of the situation. Minister of Energy Svitlana Hrynchuk told The Associated Press that \u201cthe plant remains in blackout mode, which is a significant violation of the conditions for its normal operation,\u201d marking the 10th such incident since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022. The cause, she said, was another shelling by the Russians, which damaged the only power transmission line supplying the plant from the Ukrainian energy system.",
      "The Russian-controlled Telegram channel for the plant said Saturday that \u201csufficient diesel fuel reserves are available on-site to ensure long-term autonomous operation of the generators.\u201d",
      "A radiation and nuclear energy specialist at Greenpeace Ukraine, Jan Vande Putte, said \"emergency diesel generators are considered the last line of defense, used only in extreme circumstances.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese are undoubtedly the most serious and important events since the beginning of the occupation of the ZNPP by Russia in March 2022,\u201d he said.",
      "Putte said that it was Russia\u2019s \u201cdeliberate actions\u201d that led to the plant\u2019s disconnection from the external power grid of Ukraine. He warned that the development advanced Russia\u2019s state-owned nuclear energy company Rosatom\u2019s \u201clong-standing goal\u201d to \u201cconnect to the illegally occupied power grid in Zaporizhia and Donetsk regions and restart the nuclear reactor.\u201d",
      "New satellite analysis by Greenpeace Ukraine suggests that Russia may be positioning to restart at least one reactor despite high-risk wartime conditions. The environmental group said Russian engineers are building 125 miles (201 kilometers) of power lines connecting substations in the occupied cities of Melitopol and Mariupol, with construction beginning in December 2024.",
      "According to Greenpeace\u2019s analysis, Russia has also completed construction of a new water supply system for the plant\u2019s cooling pond and deliberately damaged a 750-kilovolt power line that had connected the facility to Ukraine\u2019s electrical grid.",
      "The Associated Press could not independently verify Greenpeace Ukraine\u2019s analysis.",
      "The plant has been held by Russia since Moscow's invasion in 2022. Its six reactors remain fueled with uranium though they are in a so-called cold shutdown \u2014 meaning nuclear reactions have stopped. However, the plant relies on external electricity to keep its reactor cool and power other safety systems. That external power has been cut multiple times in the war, forcing the plant to rely on diesel generators on site.",

      "CHISINAU, Moldova -- Moldovans head to the polls Sunday to cast ballots in a tense parliamentary election fraught with claims of Russian interference. The vote could decide the country\u2019s geopolitical future: a stark choice between East and West.",
      "Landlocked between Ukraine and European Union member Romania, Moldova has spent recent years on a westward path toward the EU. Sunday\u2019s ballot to elect a new 101-seat parliament will determine whether that continues or if the country of about 2.5 million people is pulled back into Moscow's orbit.",
      "The race pits the ruling pro-Western Party of Action and Solidarity, which has held a strong parliamentary majority since 2021, against several key Russia-friendly opponents but no viable pro-European partners, leaving a lot of uncertainty over potential outcomes in the pivotal ballot.",
      "If PAS fails to win a majority on Sunday, \u201cIt would mean an end to EU integration,\u201d Igor Grosu, the PAS leader and speaker of parliament, told The Associated Press. \u201cIt would mean dependence, halting all justice reforms, infrastructure projects, everything \u2026 there is no middle option.\u201d",

      "The alleged schemes include a large-scale vote-buying operation, cyberattacks on critical government infrastructure, a plan to incite mass riots around the election, and a sprawling disinformation campaign online to sway voters.",
      "Modovan authorities have tried to crack down by conducting hundreds of raids in recent weeks, in which scores have been detained.

      "Sunday\u2019s vote also will be held less than a year after Moldovans voted narrowly in favor of securing the country\u2019s EU path, the same day Sandu won a second term in a separate vote. But those votes were also overshadowed by widespread claims of Russian interference and a massive vote-buying scheme, which Moscow denied.",

      "BENTONVILLE, Ark -- As artificial intelligence and demographic changes reshape the U.S. job market, the nation's largest private employer is trying to identify the skills its workers and the broader labor force might need for the future.",
      "Walmart on Thursday hosted more than 300 workplace experts and representatives from other companies participating in the Skills-First Workforce Initiative, a project to develop and fill stable jobs based on what people know how to do instead of whether they attended college.",
      "The retailer already has launched its own employee training and certification programs to meet Walmart's need for truck drivers and maintenance technicians, two roles for which U.S. companies say they can't recruit fast enough as experienced tradespeople retire.",
      "Walmart says it plans to offer a similar AI skills program next year through a new collaboration with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.",
      "The Associated Press sat down with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon at the company's sprawling headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, to talk about AI and the American workforce. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "MCMILLON: I would say pretty much a steady state. Turnover numbers are coming down. I'm remembering what happened during the pandemic and relative to that experience, things feel much more stable now. I think the pace of change in the employment market is just smaller and easier to manage.",
      "MCMILLON: We continue to invest in wages. So I think that\u2019s helping some, and that process will continue. As it relates to AI and the future of employment, I think for the most part, our folks are enthusiastic about it because they\u2019ve seen new tools that they\u2019re receiving that are making their jobs better. That's helping them take fewer steps.",
      "And our sales are growing so much. I think people are optimistic about the future of what their life can look like.",
      "MCMILLON: I think no one knows how this is going to play out exactly. And the way it feels to me is that basically every job gets changed. And I think the best way to think about it is getting \u201cplussed up.\u201d So how can I lean in the role that I have, regardless what that role is, to adopt new tools, leverage them and make things better than they would\u2019ve otherwise been?",
      "As I look across our company, we have everything from store associates to supply chain associates. Of the 2.1 million people (globally), something less than 75,000 of them are home office jobs. All the other ones are working in a store, a club, a distribution center. And I think those jobs change more gradually. We are still going to want to serve customers and members with people. The change as it relates to the home office jobs probably happens faster.",
      "MCMILLON: I don\u2019t know there\u2019ll be a moment where we all have clarity. I think the way for all of us to approach it, especially here at Walmart, is just in a very transparent, honest, human, straightforward way, talking to people real time about what we\u2019re learning and what we're doing and why we\u2019re doing it. That\u2019s the way that we plan to lead through this.",

      "How did we do that? Other tasks and other jobs changed, which enabled us to create new jobs that paid more and have fewer of the older jobs that went away. I hope what happens as we lead through this is that there will be pluses and minuses, but the net ends up being even more people because we have more ideas of how to grow.",
      "MCMILLON: The first thing that comes to mind is store managers. Being a store manager is such a great job and such a challenging job. And it\u2019s a job that pays well, and it pays well for a reason. You\u2019re interacting with the community with large numbers of people. You have a large number of associates. You have big sales numbers to deliver. And those skills that the store manager has are both human and technical. I think the skills that we have as human beings are valuable. They always have been, and that\u2019ll be even more true in the future.",
      "MCMILLON: To some degree, it\u2019s a lack of awareness. I think most Americans probably don\u2019t know what a tech makes that helps take care of our stores and clubs and that we can help them learn how to be a tech. The same thing\u2019s true for our drivers. So we have a need to get the word out so that people know there are some great jobs.",
      "MCMILLON: We\u2019ve been able to do that so far, and I expect that we\u2019ll continue to find great people that want to join the company and our turnover rates are down, which is helpful.",
      "MCMILLON: I think as we all work to learn and navigate the future towards a world where AI fulfills its promise, the best way to do that is to work together and to share information and learn together. It\u2019ll speed up our ability to get ahead of this so that we can do a better job of setting our associates up for success. And that\u2019s ultimately what we\u2019re trying to do. The change that\u2019s happening in the world is going to happen. Our choice is to lean in, learn (and) help lead so there are better outcomes for everybody involved.",

      "\u201cDo we continue forth ... and hope for the best?\u2019\u2019 asked Arin Schultz, Naturepedic\u2019s chief growth officer. \u201cOr do we feel like we\u2019re priced out and drop it altogether?\u2019\u2019 And if Naturepedic decides to continue with the rollout, \u201cdo we eat the cost or pass it on\u2019\u2019 to customers?",
      "Across the United States, lots of executives were asking themselves similar questions as they came to work Friday morning.",
      "Upholstered furniture, after all, wasn\u2019t the only import in Trump\u2019s crosshairs Thursday night. In addition, the president posted on his Truth Social platform, he\u2019s plastering import taxes \u2013 tariffs \u2013 of 100% on pharmaceutical drugs, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities and 25% on heavy trucks.",
      "And he\u2019s not waiting around to do it. The tariffs, he said, would take effect Wednesday.",
      "Trump also raised eyebrows by justifying the levy on vanities and sofas as necessary for national security. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how a kitchen cabinet industry is essential to winning the next war,\u2019\u2019 said Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Thursday\u2019s social media barrage was j ust the latest in Trump\u2019s push to upend American trade policy, which for decades pushed for lower trade barriers around the world.",
      "In place of an open market, Trump has built a tariff wall around the U.S. economy, slapping double-digit taxes on imports from almost every country on earth and targeting products (steel, aluminum, autos) with specific taxes of their own.",
      "Trump says the tariffs will protect U.S. industries from foreign competition, encourage companies to bring production to the United States and raise money for the U.S. Treasury.",
      "They certainly have become a moneymaker for the federal government. Since fiscal year 2025 began last Oct. 1, the U.S. Treasury has collected $172 billion in customs duties, up by $96 billion (or 126%) from the same period in fiscal 2024. Still, tariffs account for less than 4% of federal revenue.",
      "Businesses, lawyers and trade analysts are still wondering what to make of Trump\u2019s Thursday night tariffs. \u201cWe\u2019ve only seen the President\u2019s Truth Social posts,\u201d said Dan McCarthy, principal in McCarthy Consulting and a former official with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in the Biden administration. \u201cWe need to see the details.\u2019\u2019",
      "For example, Naturepedic isn\u2019t sure whether the 30% levy on upholstered furniture will be stacked atop a separate and earlier 50% tariff on goods from India.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know so far:",
      "The president has been threatening tariffs of 200% or more on pharmaceuticals. \u201cIt\u2019s to force Big Pharma to move jobs and put new factories into the U.S,\u2019\u2019 said Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School. \u201cSo it\u2019s industrial policy.\u201d",
      "In recent decades, drugmakers have moved many operations overseas \u2013 to take advantage of lower costs in China and India and tax breaks in Ireland and Switzerland.",
      "The COVID-19 experience \u2013 when countries were desperate to hang onto their own medicine and medical supplies \u2014 underscored the dangers of relying on foreign countries in a crisis, especially when a key supplier is America\u2019s geopolitical rival China.",

      "Several big drugmakers like Merck & Co. Inc., Eli Lilly and Co. and Johnson & Johnson have already announced U.S. expansion plans.",

      "The tariffs on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture come as the White House is investigating whether imports of lumber and other wood products pose a threat to U.S. national security. A report on that investigation is due Nov. 26 and could mean more and broader tariffs.",

      "Homeowners are already scaling back due to high costs and a shaky economy. According to the Labor Department, the price of living room, kitchen and dining room furniture has risen nearly 10% over the past year.",
      "\u201cAdding significant costs to furniture, cabinets, vanities and building materials will make the American dream of owning a home significantly more expensive,\u201d said Jonathan Gold, the National Retail Federation\u2019s vice president of supply chain and customs policy. \u201cThe speed at which these tariff announcements are made and implemented continues to wreak havoc on retail supply chains. The uncertainty makes it difficult for retailers to properly plan and mitigate the impact of tariffs.\u201d",
      "Charles Clevenger, a supply chain specialist at the consultancy UHY, said tariffs on pharmaceuticals make sense because so much production has shifted away from the United States to Europe and Asia. Likewise, North Carolina and other states in the American South have also lost furniture factories to cheaper competitors in the China.",
      "But he was surprised by the tariffs on heavy trucks because \u201cwe do have a rather robust industry\u2019\u2019 \u2013 with manufacturers like Paccar (parent company of Peterbilt and Kenworth).",
      "But Appleton at New York Law School suspects the tariff is aimed at Mexico, where many heavy trucks are made. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal negotiated in Trump\u2019s first term, is coming up for negotiation. \u201cI don\u2019t think that (the tariff) was done by accident, Appleton said. \u201cThey wanted to put some more pressure onto the Mexicans\u201d to make concessions in the talks.",
      "Using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Trump had launched investigations into whether imports of pharmaceuticals, lumber and heavy trucks posed a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "He\u2019d justified his broader tariffs another way: by declaring national emergencies under a 1977 law. But two courts have ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose import taxes. The Supreme Court is hearing the case on appeal.",
      "Robert Lawrence, a professor of International trade and investment at Harvard University, said that using Section 232 gives the president a Plan B if the courts strike down his IEEPA tariffs. \u201cHe now has insurance and shows that he\u2019s going to be able to get away with raising tariffs, even if he loses that case.\u201d",
      "But Ted Murphy, co-leader of the trade practice at the Sidley Austin law firm, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to discern much of a plan ... What the administration does is they identify a problem and then the solution is a big tariff. The question is whether that\u2019s really as nuanced or strategic as it could be. There could be a strategy but it\u2019s hard to discern from a tweet.\u2019\u2019",

      "The Washington attorney who brokered book deals for Barack Obama, George W. Bush and dozens of other government leaders has died at age 79",
      "NEW YORK -- Robert B. Barnett, a powerhouse Washington attorney who became a fixture in the political and publishing worlds as the literary representative for Barack and Michelle Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton and dozens of other leaders, has died at age 79.",
      "Barnett's executive assistant, Ashley Duffy, told The Associated Press that he died Thursday night. Additional details were not immediately available.",
      "A stocky, raspy-voiced man with tortoise shell glasses, antique cuff links and a knack for being both forthright and discrete, Bob Barnett embodied an era when it was possible to work freely with both Democrats and Republicans and politics could stop at the edge of a good book deal. He was a longtime Democrat, working on Jimmy Carter's 1976 campaign and helping Bill Clinton and other candidates in debate preparation. But he would broker contracts for such a wide range of political figures that he liked to joke that should his clients all gather in one room the result would be \u201cWorld War III.\u201d",
      "He was a partner at the high-end law firm Williams & Connolly, and for more than 20 years no one approached his stature as an intermediary between the Washington elite and New York publishers. From the early 1990s through the end of the Obama administration, in 2017, Barnett represented three consecutive presidents and first ladies \u2014 the Clintons, George W. and Laura Bush and the Obamas \u2014 and much of the remaining A-list political players, from Ted Kennedy and Mitch McConnell to Dick Cheney and Joe Biden, from Paul Ryan and Donald Rumsfeld to Al Franken and Elizabeth Warren.",
      "Barnett was called upon so often by politicians leaving office that he became known as \u201cthe doorman to Washington\u2019s revolving door.\u201d",
      "He was not an agent, he liked to point out, but an attorney who billed clients by the hour instead of receiving a percentage of royalties. It was a unique business arrangement that priced out the average writer, but well rewarded Obama, the Clintons and others who landed multi-million dollar deals.",
      "The general public could have made good money betting on Barnett's authors to prevail in elections. In six consecutive presidential races, from 1992-2012, a current or future Barnett client was elected, often defeating a non-Barnett client.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s one of the sagest advisers I\u2019ve ever been able to call upon,\u201d Republican strategist Karl Rove, a Barnett client and top aide to George W. Bush, told Politico in 2017. \u201cHe has counseled me on every professional decision I\u2019ve made.\"",
      "Barnett also handled negotiations for media executives and reporters (Roger Ailes, Bob Woodward, Chris Wallace), musical superstars (Elton John, Barbra Streisand), business leaders (Jack Welch, Phil Knight), international leaders (former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Queen Noor of Jordan) and one of the world's best-selling novelists, James Patterson. For years, he was not only representing presidents, but Jake Tapper, Brit Hume and other White House reporters who covered them. One of the best-selling political novels in recent years, \u201cThe President Is Missing,\u201d was a collaboration conceived by Barnett for Patterson and Bill Clinton.",
      "His political winning streak ended after 2016 when non-client Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. He was disdainful of Trump and eventually overtaken by the Creative Artists Agency and such younger Washington players as the Javelin literary agency.",
      "Asked in 2012 by the British law firm Chamber Associates how he wanted to be remembered, Barnett responded. \u201c\u2018He was loyal, kept confidences, and tried his best. He was a good husband, father, grandfather, counselor, and friend.\" Around the same time, Obama offered a wryer take, as recorded in Mark Leibovich\u2019s bestselling political chronicle \u201cThis Town.\u201d",

When Barnett prefaced one of his comments with \u201cthe conventional wisdom is,\u201d Obama responded, \u201cBob, you ARE the conventional wisdom.\u201d",
      "In 1972, Barnett married Rita Braver, a fellow graduate of the University of Wisconsin and a future CBS television correspondent. They had a daughter, Meredith.",
      "A native of Waukegan, Illinois, Robert Bruce Barnett graduated as senior class president from Waukegan High School, majored in political science at the University of Wisconsin and received a law degree from the University of Chicago. He moved to Washington in the early 1970s, clerking for Supreme Court Justice Byron White and working as aide to then-Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota. In 1975, he joined Williams & Connolly, and was made a partner three years later. Beyond his political clients, he also represented numerous corporations and businesses, including Deutsche Bank, McDonald's and JM Family Enterprises.",
      "Barnett did not plan his rise in book publishing. He had helped Vice Presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro prepare for her 1984 debate against George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan's vice president, and consulted with her when reports came out about her husband's alleged ties to organized crime. After the election, Ferraro asked him to help find a publisher for her memoir. Barnett, as inexperienced about publishing a book as Ferraro was about writing one, worked with New York agent Esther Newberg on a 7-figure deal with Bantam Books. Soon after, he arranged a lucrative deal for David Stockman, the first budget director in the Reagan administration.",
      "Among political leaders, he was especially close to the Clintons. They turned to him when White House aide and family friend Vince Foster killed himself in 1993 and when news broke that Bill Clinton had an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. His influence was never greater than in 2008, during the Democratic presidential primary. The main contenders were his longtime client, Hillary Clinton, and a new client, Obama, who had dropped his previous agent and turned to Barnett to make a deal for \u201cThe Audacity of Hope,\u201d one of history's bestselling political books and a key factor in his stunning rise.",
      "After a long and emotional primary campaign, Clinton, who had been heavily favored, conceded in June 2008 and began negotiating her role at the Democratic National Convention. The negotiations were handled by Barnett. By the end of the year, Obama had been elected (defeating the non-Barnett client Sen. John McCain) and Barnett was arranging a multi-million dollar deal for another client, the outgoing president, George W. Bush.",

      "The Transportation Department will immediately tighten up the requirements for non-citizens to get commercial drivers licenses after three fatal crashes this year that officials say were caused by immigrant truck drivers who never should have received licenses.",
      "The nationwide audit of these licenses began after a fatal U-turn crash in Florida that killed two people caused by a truck driver who officials said was in the country illegally. But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said fatal crashes caused by truck drivers who shouldn\u2019t have had licenses were also found in Texas and Alabama earlier this year.",
      "Duffy also threatened to revoke $160 million in federal funding for California because investigators found that one in four of the 145 commercial drivers licenses for non-citizens issued since June that they reviewed should have never been issued under the current rules. That state has 30 days to audit its program and come up with a plan to comply or it will lose funding.",
      "Duffy said the current rules aren\u2019t strict enough and a number of states aren\u2019t following them. The audit found licenses that were issued improperly in California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, and Washington.",
      "\u201cWe have a government system designed to keep American families on the road safe. But that system has been compromised,\u201d Duffy said.",
      "Previously, Duffy threatened to pull some federal funding from California, Washington and New Mexico for failing to enforce English proficiency requirements for truckers that went into effect this summer. The Transportation Department is still reviewing the responses from those states.",
      "All states must pause issuing commercial drivers licenses to non-citizens until they can comply with the new rules.",
      "Officials said the new rules would mean that roughly 190,000 of the 200,000 non-citizens that currently hold one of these commercial licenses should never have received one, but the rules aren't retroactive so those drivers won't lose their licenses. Only drivers who have either an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa will now be eligible to get a commercial driver's license. Just having an employment authorization document won't be enough.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader John Thune is rejecting Democratic demands on health care as unserious but says a government shutdown is still \u201cavoidable\u201d despite sharp divisions ahead of Wednesday's funding deadline.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big believer that there\u2019s always a way out,\u201d the South Dakota Republican said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. \u201cAnd I think there are off-ramps here, but I don\u2019t think that the negotiating position, at least at the moment, that the Democrats are trying to exert here is going to get you there.\u201d",
      "Thune said Democrats are going to have to \u201cdial back\u201d their demands, which include immediately extending health insurance subsidies and reversing the health care policies in the massive tax bill that Republicans passed over the summer. Absent that, Thune said, \u201cwe\u2019re probably plunging forward toward the shutdown.\u201d",
      "It's just the latest standoff in Washington over government funding, stretching back through several administrations. President Donald Trump was the driving force behind the longest shutdown ever during his first term, as he sought money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. This time it is Democrats who are making demands as they face intense pressure from their core supporters to stand up to the Republican president and his policies.",
      "Democrats have shown little signs of relenting, just before spending runs out Wednesday. Their position remained the same even after the White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday released a memo that said agencies should consider a \u201creduction in force\u201d for many federal programs if the government closes \u2014 meaning thousands of federal workers could be permanently laid off.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the OMB memo was simply an \u201cattempt at intimidation\u201d and predicted the \u201cunnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back.\u201d",
      "Thune stopped short of criticizing the White House threat of mass layoffs, saying the situation remains \u201ca hypothetical.\u201d Still, he said no one should be surprised by the memo as \u201ceveryone knows Russ Vought,\u201d the head of the Office of Management and Budget, and his longtime advocacy for slashing government.",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s all avoidable,\u201d Thune said. \u201cAnd so if they don\u2019t want to go down that path, there\u2019s a way to avoid going down that path.\u201d",
      "One way to avoid a shutdown, Thune said, would be for enough Democrats to vote with Republicans for a stripped-down \u201cclean\u201d bill to keep the government open for the next seven weeks while negotiations on spending continue. That\u2019s how Republicans avoided a shutdown in March, when Schumer and several other Democrats decided at the last minute to vote with Republicans \u2014 to great political cost when Schumer's party then revolted.",
      "A seven-week funding bill has already passed the House.",

      "Thune suggested some individual bipartisan bills to fund parts of the government for the next year could be part of a compromise, \u201cbut that requires cooperation from both sides,\u201d he said.",
      "Democrats say they are frustrated that Thune hasn\u2019t approached them to negotiate \u2014 and that Trump abruptly canceled a meeting with Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York that had been scheduled for this week. Trump wrote on social media, \u201cI have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive.\u201d",
      "Thune said he \u201cdid have a conversation with the president\u201d and offered his opinion on the meeting, which he declined to disclose. \u201cBut I think the president speaks for himself, and I think he came to the conclusion that that meeting would not be productive,\u201d Thune said.",

As it turns out, the Week 1 loss to Florida State may have been exactly what the Crimson Tide (3-1) needed to gain an edge, build an identity and go on a run.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s two things you can do when things are coming down on you a little bit: you can back yourself in the corner, or you can fight,\u201d DeBoer said, reflecting on the turnaround since Aug. 30. \"These guys, you know, made up their minds. They are going to fight. The staff is doing the same thing. I think that was where it started, but it\u2019s just continuing to build.\u201d",
      "Quarterback Ty Simpson, the Crimson Tide's new leader, knows the loss was a turning point for a team now full of promise.",
      "\u201cWe know that we didn\u2019t play up to our standard in Week 1,\" Simpson said. \"We just came back as a team, right, and were like, \u2018All right, what are we going to do now? That\u2019s over. Do we want to be known as the team who doesn\u2019t finish, doesn\u2019t sustain competitive stamina, or are we going to play with a chip on our shoulder?\u2019\u201d",
      "Simpson threw for 276 yards, two touchdowns and ran one in for a score against Georgia, helping Alabama maintain the lead through all four quarters and control the game from start to finish. It was a well-rounded, statement-making win, the kind that puts a target on Alabama's back moving forward.",

Got to understand what it took mentally, physically, emotionally today to be able to sustain from start to finish,\u201d DeBoer said. \u201cCan we sustain the energy? Can we sustain the passion? And you know not just for the season, for the game, but each play.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe believe that there\u2019s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy\" and energy, Fink said.",
      "In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.",
      "Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.",
      "However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.",
      "Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.",
      "Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.",
      "Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.",
      "\u201cIt's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don\u2019t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,\u201d said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.",
      "The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers.",
      "Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of what\u2019s the price and will the regulator approve it,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cThe challenge is they\u2019re not going to come up for sale very often.\u201d",
      "That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.",
      "That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.",

      "On the other side are the state attorney general\u2019s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.",
      "In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price \u2014 $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium \u2014 to affect electric rates.",
      "In essence, Allete \u2014 which solicited bids for a buyout \u2014 argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota\u2019s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.",
      "Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.",
      "However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to meet its financing needs.",
      "It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.",
      "In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's \u201cintent to do what private equity is expected to do \u2013 pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.\u201d",
      "In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.",
      "They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.",
      "\u201cFor the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,\u201d the staff wrote. \u201cFor the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity \u2018wins\u2019 and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses \u2013 it is a lose-lose.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Rep. John Moolenaar has requested an urgent briefing from the White House after Trump supported a deal giving Americans a majority stake in TikTok",
      "WASHINGTON -- The chairman of a House committee that pushed for the law demanding TikTok be spun off from its Chinese owners has requested an urgent briefing from the White House, one day after Trump signed an executive order supporting a proposed deal that would put the popular social video platform under U.S. ownership.",
      "In a statement released Friday, Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, praised the proposed deal as \"an important step\u201d in transitioning ownership of the TikTok platform to American hands but he emphasized that \u201cdivestment was not the law's only requirement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance,\u201d Moolenaar said.",
      "The Michigan Republican's statement marks the first congressional effort to conduct oversight into the negotiations over TikTok, coming nearly two weeks after Chinese and American officials met in Spain to discuss a framework divestment deal for TikTok. Trump on Thursday signed an executive order providing support for the deal, and said Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to move forward with negotiations.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to an inquiry from the Associated Press regarding the urgent briefing.",
      "Much is still unknown about the actual deal in the works, but the new U.S. venture would license the famed ByteDance-owned algorithm that currently keeps TikTok users engaged. U.S. tech giant Oracle, a confirmed partner in the U.S. investment consortium that would own TikTok, would audit the copy of the algorithm and monitor it for security purposes.",
      "Vice President JD Vance on Thursday assured the public that the deal would not only keep TikTok operating but also protect Americans' data privacy as required by law. Moolenaar on Friday said he would like to know more.",
      "While algorithms are valuable assets, the real value of TikTok is its users, which is likely why the consortium won\u2019t just start from scratch to build a new app, said computer scientist Bart Knijnenburg, an associate professor at Clemson University who has studied how recommendation systems steer people to online content.",
      "Knijnenburg said all algorithms are biased in some way and if the administration is serious about retraining the TikTok algorithm to avoid Chinese influence, it should push for \u201cradical openness\u201d in TikTok\u2019s mechanics so that users have a window into how bias might be influencing their feeds.",
      "More than politics, Knijnenburg said the biggest problem with TikTok\u2019s algorithm is that it\u2019s geared toward addictive engagement and overuse.",
      "\u201cMoving it to the U.S. is not going to magically solve these types of problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAny company might put undue influence on these applications and from a business perspective, the best way to engage users is to make them addicted to watching these videos, which is not a good idea.\u201d",
      "Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, doubts that the deal, as revealed so far, complies with the law.",
      "\u201cThe law is clear: divestiture means severance, not supervision,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cA board seat for ByteDance or any continued role in maintaining the algorithm would flout Congress\u2019s mandate.\"",
      "Though the details have yet to be finalized, the U.S. investment group\u2019s controlling stake in the new venture would be around 80%. While ByteDance is expected to have a stake in the new venture, it would be less than 20% \u2014 a portion of the ownership reserved for foreign investors. The board running the new platform would be controlled by U.S. investors. ByteDance will be represented by one person on the board, but that individual will be excluded from any security-related matters.",

      "Singleton argues that a board foothold by ByteDance is not merely symbolic. \u201cByteDance\u2019s reported role as the largest single shareholder in a restructured TikTok U.S. venture, combined with a board seat, ensures continuing Chinese influence over the app,\u201d he said. \u201cPlainly put, ByteDance on the board means Beijing in the building.\u201d",
      "Vance said he expects the new U.S.-based TikTok to be valued at about $14 billion, describing it as a \u201cgood deal\u201d for investors who must ultimately decide \u201cwhat they want to invest in and what they think is the proper value.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a \u201csurprisingly low\u201d valuation, said Daniel Keum, a management professor at Columbia University\u2019s business school.",
      "Keum said it\u2019s possible that \u201cpolitics overrode the business case\u201d or that the licensing structure, which hasn\u2019t yet been disclosed, could have been designed with high fees or profit-sharing that depressed the value of TikTok\u2019s app in the U.S.",
      "Keum said TikTok had an early edge in attracting youth to its innovative video-sharing format, but its competitiveness has \u201cfundamentally eroded\u201d as social media creators and influencers increasingly post their videos on many different apps.",
      "As TikTok\u2019s popularity soared among young Americans in the past several years, U.S. lawmakers grew concerned that Beijing \u2014 viewed by many on the Capitol Hill as the biggest geopolitical rival to the U.S. \u2014 could use the platform to influence public discourse in the United States.",
      "\u201cByteDance has shown time and again that it is a bad actor, and the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s ultimate goal is to see America divided and weakened,\u201d Moolenaar said in his statement. \u201cThat is why, on an overwhelming bipartisan basis, Congress required ByteDance to divest control of TikTok.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden signed legislation passed by Congress last year that would ban TikTok unless ByteDance sold its U.S. assets to an American company by early this year. The U.S. Supreme Court in January unanimously upheld the TikTok law.",
      "Trump, after he returned to the White House, has repeatedly signed orders that have allowed TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. as his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "On Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't provide any new information but repeated China's position on TikTok.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government respects the will of enterprises and welcomes them to conduct sound commercial negotiations based on market rules, reaching solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and achieve a balanced outcome of interests,\u201d said Guo Jiakun, a ministry spokesperson. \"We hope the U.S. will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises investing in the United States.\u201d",

It does not apply to future works.",
      "\u201cThis is a fair settlement,\u201d Alsup said, though he added that distributing it to all parties will be \u201ccomplicated.\u201d About 465,000 books are on the list of works pirated by Anthropic, according to Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors.",

As we\u2019ve consistently maintained, the court\u2019s landmark June ruling that AI training constitutes transformative fair use remains intact. This settlement simply resolves narrow claims about how certain materials were obtained,\u201d said Aparna Sridhar, deputy general counsel at Anthropic.",
      "The Authors Guild, meanwhile, said the settlement \u201cmarks a milestone in authors\u2019 fights against AI companies\u2019 theft of their works.

Others share knowledge on social media, and experienced foragers offer training to novices on safe and sustainable practices.",
      "The renewed interest ranges from those wanting to be budget-conscious \u2014 foraging is free after all \u2014 to those wanting to be more mindful of their environmental footprint. Some even use foraging as a creative outlet, using mushrooms they find to create spore prints and other art.",

Particle pollution kills millions of people worldwide each year \u2014 and tens of thousands in the United States \u2014 according to scientific studies and reports.",
      "Gore's coalition uses 300 satellites, 30,000 ground-tracking sensors and artificial intelligence to track 137,095 sources of particle pollution, with 3,937 of them categorized as \u201csuper emitters\u201d for how much they spew. Users can look at long-term trends, but in about a year Gore hopes these can become available daily so they can be incorporated into weather apps, like allergy reports.",

But it acknowledged in a post last week on its website that what it described as \u201cunauthorized AI generated content\u201d had been incorporated into its Aug. 14 update of \u201cTomb Raider IV\u2013VI Remastered\" that angered fans.",

      "Once the initial shock subsided, she resolved to fight back. Her Paris lawyer, Jonathan Elkaim, is seeking an apology from Aspyr and financial redress.",

      "World Gorilla Day is observed on September 24",
      "BWINDI, Uganda -- Sept. 24 is observed as World Gorilla Day. It was launched in 2017 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of a Rwanda-based gorilla study center founded by Dian Fossey, the American primatologist and conservationist who gained global renown for her research.",
      "The gorillas Fossey studied and looked after were mountain gorillas that belong to the species known as the eastern gorilla and live mostly in the Virunga Massif, a mountainous area encompassing parts of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. The second species, known as the western gorilla, inhabits areas of west and central Africa.",
      "Gorillas are losing their habitat because of poaching and other threats. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both gorilla species as endangered, with three of four subspecies critically endangered.",
      "Here are some things to know about the great apes:",
      "Humans share much of their DNA with gorillas, and scientists cite figures showing up to 98% similarity. \u201cGorillas are humans\u2019 closest living relatives after chimpanzees, and are of comparable importance for the study of human origins and evolution,\u201d according to the science journal Nature. This kinship with humans is one reason gorillas are susceptible to infections spread through close contact with tourists, researchers and others who come near them. Gorillas are especially vulnerable to the influenza virus, and respiratory illnesses are a frequent cause of death among adult gorillas.",
      "Visitors tracking gorillas in the wild are usually urged to stand at least 7 meters (yards) from the primates \u2014 as well as not to touch them even if they wander, as they sometimes do, closer to people. In her lifetime, Fossey worried that gorilla tourism was injurious to the well-being of gorillas because it might alter their behavior in the wild, but tourism-driven gorilla conservation projects in countries such as Uganda has proved successful over the years.",

      "Gorillas in the wild live in families, with the dominant male \u2014 known as the silverback because of the patch of silvery fur on his back \u2014 as the head of the group. He can co-exist with younger males, who defer to him, as well as many females, juveniles and infants.",
      "Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, home to many of the world's remaining gorillas, has 27 families considered \u201chabituated,\u201d trained to appear comfortable in the presence of humans. Most silverbacks are known to be protective of their families. The silverback in one of the Bwindi families is named Murinzi, a local word for \u201cprotector,\u201d because rangers have seen him to be quite solicitous.",
      "To assert their authority, silverbacks sometimes stand on their hind legs, beat their chests and vocalize, sending younger males in flight and warning rivals from other groups. Gorilla mothers are just as generous with their offspring, and the \u201clove they show for their youngsters is undeniably deep and evident to everyone lucky enough to observe it,\u201d according to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, a charity working to protect the primates. Gorillas can live for over 40 years in the wild.",
      "The powerful majesty of gorillas in the wild is one reason they fascinate tourists. But while they are the largest living primates, they can also seem gentle and meek. An average silverback can weigh up to 180 kilograms (396 pounds). Herbivorous creatures, gorillas eat mostly leaves and the shoots and stems of plants. They may also eat ants and snails.",
      "The International Gorilla Conservation Program says the main threat to gorillas is habitat loss from the clearance of the forested ecosystems they inhabit. \u201cConversion of land for agriculture and competition for limited natural resources such as firewood lead to varying degrees of deforestation,\u201d according to the group, a coalition of conservation nonprofits focusing on the survival of mountain gorillas.",

      "Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow",
      "VINSKI, Estonia -- Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow. But those defenses won\u2019t guard against the threat it and its NATO allies face from Russian drones and electronic warfare.",
      "From the Baltic to the Black Sea, countries bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are facing the spillover from Moscow's war in Ukraine.",
      "The incursion of about 20 Russian drones into Poland this month shone a spotlight on holes in NATO's air defenses, as multimillion-dollar jets had to be scrambled to respond to drones that cost thousands and that ended up crashing into the Polish countryside. Russia denied that it targeted Poland, but Polish officials suggested it was intentional.",
      "Faced with a growing problem, some EU defense ministers will meet Friday to discuss creating a \u201cdrone wall.\"",
      "NATO warned Russia on Tuesday that it would defend against any further breaches of its airspace after Estonia said Russian fighter jets violated it last week. But although the alliance knows how to identify threats from jets and missiles, dealing with drones is a greater challenge, officials said.",
      "In Poland, \u201cmost of the drones were not detected,\" said Hanno Pevkur, Estonia\u2019s defense minister. \u201cThis is a real gap we have to solve.\u201d",
      "Military and defense officials from the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 NATO and EU members that border Russia \u2014 told The Associated Press that defending against drones requires solving a complex set of technological, financial and bureaucratic problems.",
      "Europe needs cheaper technology to buy and to speed up slow production and procurement cycles, they said. But even then, drone technology is advancing so quickly that anything bought now could be outdated in months.",
      "\u201cWhat I need,\u201d said Lt. General Andrus Merilo who commands Estonia's military, is technology that is \u201cgood enough, it\u2019s affordable and can be produced in mass.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t need high-end capabilities of which I can fire only one, against targets which will be attacking in hundreds,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia is using drones every night in Ukraine because each drone is a \u201clottery ticket that always wins,\u201d said Kusti Salm a former top official at Estonia\u2019s Defense Ministry.",
      "That\u2019s because a drone either hits something or, if Ukraine shoots it down with a missile, it drains Kyiv's air defenses and finances, since missiles are more expensive than drones, said Salm who now runs Frankenburg Technologies, a company developing low-cost anti-drone missiles.",
      "Although NATO countries have a \u201cvery good understanding\u201d of how to defend against conventional threats such as missiles and planes, they need to rapidly improve at dealing with drone threats, said Tomas Godliauskas, Lithuania\u2019s vice-minister of national defense.",
      "When the Russian drones flew into Poland, NATO nations deployed fighter jets and attack helicopters and put missile defense systems on alert. But none of those options was specifically designed for drone warfare.",
      "Although Russia and Ukraine have been firing more and more drones at each other, there has been less investment in counter-drone systems, said Salm. He suggested that's partly because it's easier to get a drone to fly than it is to develop something to detect or intercept it.",
      "Slow, low-flying drones made from wood, fiberglass, plastic or polystyrene might not be detected by radar systems searching for a fast-moving missile made of metal, or they might look like birds or a plane. Enemy operatives can also bypass defenses by launching drones from inside a country, as Ukraine did to devastating effect when it attacked Russian airfields this year.",
      "There are also other technological hurdles, including trying to jam the enemy\u2019s drones and communications without cutting your own, Merilo said.",
      "In August, a Ukrainian drone \u2014 possibly sent off course by Russian electronic jamming \u2014 landed in a field in southeastern Estonia. It crashed because the military wasn't capable of detecting it, Merilo said.",

      "There is growing support among European leaders for establishing some sort of drone wall along the EU\u2019s eastern border, though the bloc in March denied funding to a joint Estonia-Lithuania proposal to establish one.",
      "The EU needs to prioritize funding for the project, said Pevkur. But although support for the idea is growing, actually creating a drone defense system won't be easy.",
      "\u201cDrones are not mosquitoes,\u201d the Estonian minister said, suggesting they would be unlikely to be zapped by an \u201celectronic wall\u201d along NATO\u2019s borders.",
      "There are many types of drones, including those used for intelligence and reconnaissance, that fly at high-altitude, that are used in attacks, or that even remain attached to a thin fiber-optic cable while flying, making them impossible to jam. Russia also uses decoy drones in Ukraine that carry no payload and are designed to exhaust air defenses.",
      "Any plan to defend against drones needs a multilayered approach including sensors, \u201celectronic warfare \u2026 also low-cost small missiles or attack drones,\u201d said Merilo.",
      "Although the need for better drone defenses isn't new, it\u2019s still largely only possible to buy systems that are \u201creally expensive,\u201d take a long time to develop and cannot be mass-produced, Merilo said.",
      "He suggested that\u2019s partly because big defense companies that have spent decades developing billion-dollar air defense systems might not want something new \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 on the market.",
      "\u201cWe have to understand this game,\u201d Merilo said, adding that some technology does exist, but \u201cthe question is who \u2014 and how fast they can start producing.\u201d",
      "Facing nightly onslaughts, Ukraine is rapidly developing its technology, including long-range attack drones and smaller ones for use on the frontlines.",
      "Latvia and some other NATO countries have turned to Salm's company, Frankenburg, to acquire its small anti-drone missiles once they're in production.",
      "But a piecemeal approach isn't ideal, Salm said. Instead, the EU needs to invest more in European startups which can turbocharge drone defense production that can be used by allies across different weapons systems, he said.",
      "Europe needs to switch to \u201csemi-wartime thinking\u201d and foster greater collaboration between the military, government and defense industries to be able to fill its technology gap, said Godliauskas.",
      "In Ukraine, it's sometimes only a matter of weeks between drone technology being developed and used on the battlefield. Europe \u201cdoesn't have time\u201d to spend years waiting to acquire equipment, the Lithuanian said.",
      "Another lesson from Ukraine is that what works today, might not work tomorrow, Godliauskas noted.",
      "While drone defense is critical now, it would be wrong to forget about everything else, said T\u016btins. That's because Moscow is using \u201call means possible\u201d to destabilize Europe, including hybrid warfare and cyberattacks, he said.",

      "BWINDI, Uganda -- News of a sick or injured mountain gorilla can worry local residents in this mountainous area that\u2019s home to the endangered species. That\u2019s partly because most of the gorillas have been given names, allowing rangers and others to humanize the animal's suffering.",
      "But widespread interest in protecting mountain gorillas also comes from the economic benefits of tourism that have turned poachers into conservationists, married women into porters and rangers into eloquent spokespeople for the great apes.",
      "\u201cIf we know there is a gorilla that is sick, you see everyone is concerned. \u2018Why? Why is the gorilla sick? It\u2019s suffering from what?\u2019\u201d said Joyleen Tugume, a ranger-guide in Uganda\u2019s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. \u201cEven the community people. Everyone is touched.\u201d",
      "Tugume said poaching in the park is increasingly rare since \u201cwe are actually all working together to make sure conservation goes well, because we are all benefitting.\u201d",
      "Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in a remote part of southwestern Uganda, is home to many groups of habituated gorillas that have become comfortable in the presence of humans.",
      "Tourists pay a considerable sum \u2014 $800 in permit fees per foreign non-resident \u2014 for the right to see gorillas in their natural habitat. An official revenue-sharing policy channels $10 from each permit back to the local community via their elected leaders, who can invest in projects ranging from water provision to health care. Local communities are also entitled to 20% of all park entry fees generated annually.",
      "Many locals, including reformed poachers living near the park, told The Associated Press that the money generated has ensured the recovery of the species, with habitat encroachment and poaching in decline as wildlife authorities seek to collaborate more with nearby communities.",
      "Philemon Mujuni, a poacher until five years ago, said he once thought of the gorilla as a hostile animal to be killed before it killed him if he ever encountered one. As a boy, he used to follow his father, whom he described as \u201ca senior poacher,\u201d into the forest to help carry the antelopes they pulled from traps.",
      "But in 2020, when poachers killed a beloved gorilla named Rafiki, Mujuni and others formed an organization of former poachers who now say the primates are more important than any other animal.",
      "They serve as community watchdogs, looking out for people who might venture into the forest to set duiker traps that sometimes ensnare gorillas. Their surveillance efforts help support the work of armed rangers who also regularly patrol the park.",
      "\u201cWhen community conservation rangers sensitized us, we said, \u2018Let us reform and stop poaching in the national park of Bwindi,\u2019\u201d Mujuni said. \u201cI can\u2019t go there. Because, through the conservation team from (Bwindi Impenetrable National Park), we get some money from these gorillas we could kill.\u201d",
      "Peter Tumwesigye, one of 128 members of the group of reformed poachers, said gorillas are so important that people whose actions lead to a gorilla's death should be jailed.",
      "\u201cSo that others can learn and never do it again,\u201d he said.",

She studies the weekly inventory from Good Shepherd, Maine\u2019s only food bank, for good deals on butter and cheese.",
      "Every Monday morning, she shops at three different stores, keeping lists of prices in her head and remembering what particular clients want. On a recent trip to Sam\u2019s Club, she was searching for affordable eggs.",

      "The eggs were destined for Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard, the food pantry in Winterport, Maine, that Allen has helped run for the past 17 years. Every Wednesday, she and a tightknit group of volunteers provide 25 to 30 families with heaping bags of food.",
      "Maine has long been one of the most food insecure states in New England. Directors of food pantries say the task of making sure people are fed is getting harder because of diminishing food supplies, increasing demand and an overwhelming reliance on volunteers, many of whom are retirees with ages up into their 80s.",
      "About one in seven people in rural Waldo County, where Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard is, were food insecure in 2023, a rate that was similar to the state and national average, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying on Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d",

      "\u201cI can watch the availability of federal food going down every month,\u201d Allen said.",
      "Charitable food networks are also bracing for $186 billion in cuts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the federal low-income nutrition program better known as food stamps. In turn, Feeding America predicts that food pantries will see more demand.",
      "Complicating matters is the infrastructure through which the U.S. distributes most food to those who need help. In Maine, the nearly 600 hunger relief agencies that get free and low-cost food from Good Shepherd Food Bank rely on volunteers. This includes 250 food pantries as well as soup kitchens, senior centers, shelters, schools and youth programs.",
      "More than 75% of these organizations rely completely on volunteers, with no paid staff, according to Good Shepherd.",

It shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d",
      "Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard hummed with activity on a recent Wednesday morning, cans stacked in piles six feet high and children\u2019s collages taped to a cooler.",
      "Keith Ritchie was greeting clients \u2014 and keeping a gentle eye out to make sure no one took more than their fair share of limited foods. At 89, he is the pantry\u2019s oldest worker, although Betty Williams, 88, teases him about who\u2019s older.",
      "In more than 17 years of service, Ritchie said, \u201cI\u2019ve only missed twice.\u201d He drives 20 miles (32 kilometers) each way to dole out groceries and fill bags with \u201csurprises\u201d \u2013 donated items like Girl Scout cookies.",

      "Younger volunteers can be harder to come by than affordable eggs. About 35% of Mainers volunteer \u2014 the third-highest rate in the nation, according to a 2024 report on the state of Maine\u2019s civic health.

      "Nelson died at his home in Salt Lake City, church spokesperson Candice Madsen said in a statement.",
      "Nelson, a former heart surgeon, spent four decades in the highest levels of church leadership after he was selected in 1984 to join a top church governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He ascended to the presidency in January 2018 when Thomas S. Monson died and in 2024 became the first president of the faith to hit the century mark.",
      "The next president of the faith, known widely as the Mormon church, was not immediately named, but is expected to be Dallin H. Oaks, per church protocol. He is the next longest-tenured member of the church\u2019s governing Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.",
      "Sen. Mike Lee of Utah posted a warm tribute to Nelson on social media shortly after the announcement.",
      "\u201cFor as long as I\u2019ve known him, he has exuded \u2014 and for me, he\u2019s come to personify \u2014 the kind of faith, humility, and quiet confidence that tends to be the constant companion of a devoted servant and follower of Jesus Christ,\u201d Lee wrote.",
      "The former heart surgeon had a vibrant and transformative tenure, especially in 2018, his first year, when he made a surprising announcement calling on people to stop using the shorthand names \u201cMormon\u201d and \u201cLDS\u201d as substitutes for the full name of the religion, a sharp shift after previous church leaders spent millions to promote the moniker over decades.",
      "Nelson also made headlines the next year when he repealed rules that banned baptisms for children of gay parents and labeled same-sex couples as sinners eligible for expulsion. Those 2015 policies had generated widespread backlash.",
      "But even though Nelson\u2019s administration was gentler and more welcoming to LGBTQ+ people than those of previous presidents, the church stance on same-sex marriage didn't change. His administration also sharpened rules limiting the participation of members who pursue gender-affirming medical procedures or change their names, pronouns or how they dress, leading to criticism that it would marginalize transgender members.",
      "Nelson and one of his top counselors described their approach to LGBTQ+ members as trying to balance the \u201clove of the Lord and the law of the Lord.\u201d",
      "Presidents of the Utah-based faith are considered prophets who lead the church through revelations from God in collaboration with two top counselors and members of the Quorum of the Twelve.",
      "Nelson was known for leading the church through the COVID-19 pandemic and severing the faith\u2019s century-long ties with the Boy Scouts of America, creating the church\u2019s own youth program that also could serve the more than half of its 17 million members who live outside the U.S. and Canada.",

      "The disassociation came after the Boy Scouts of America decided to allow LGBTQ+ youth members and adult volunteers to join.",
      "During his tenure, long-simmering scrutiny swelled over the way the faith handles sexual abuse reports lodged with local leaders. An Associated Press investigation found the religion's sexual abuse reporting hotline can be misused by its leaders to divert abuse accusations away from law enforcement and instead to church attorneys who may bury the problem, leaving victims in harm\u2019s way.",
      "Nelson and church leaders defended their practices, saying the hotline \u201chas everything to do with protecting children and has nothing to do with cover-up.\"",
      "The church also faced scrutiny about closed door, one-on-one interviews between youth and local adult leaders where questions might arise about identity and sexuality.",
      "The faith changed its guidelines to direct lay leaders never to disregard a report of abuse, a more direct instruction than previous guidelines. It also allowed children to bring a parent or adult with them during one-one-one interviews with local church leaders known as bishops.",
      "Nelson also appointed non-American leaders to the all-white and mostly American top governing body and pushed to publish regional hymnbooks that celebrate local music and culture worldwide.",
      "The president shortened Sunday services and accelerated a long-running push to build more temples, dotting the world with the faith\u2019s lavish houses of worship despite resistance in some parts of the U.S.",
      "He also forged a formal partnership with the NAACP. Until 1978, the church banned Black men from the lay priesthood, a policy rooted in the racist belief that black skin was a curse. The church disavowed the reasons behind the ban in a 2013 essay, but never issued a formal apology. It remains one of the most sensitive topics for the church.",
      "Born in Salt Lake City in 1924, Nelson joined the religion in young adulthood. He was a doctor at the age of 22 and served a two-year Army medical tour of duty during the Korean War before resuming a medical career that included being director of thoracic surgery residency at the University of Utah.",
      "Nelson was known for his skill of precision, which made him a successful surgeon during his time in church leadership. He had a reputation for stressing obedience to law and to what he called the \u201ccovenant path,\u201d the series of ordinances and practices that mark a life in the faith, said Mormon scholar Matthew Bowman, a religion professor at Claremont Graduate Universities.",
      "Nelson and his first wife, Dantzel White, had 10 children together. After she died in 2005, Nelson married Wendy Watson in 2006.",

      "BROWNSVILLE, Tenn. -- A 10-foot statue of rock n' roll queen Tina Turner was unveiled Saturday in the rural Tennessee community where she grew up \u2014 before becoming a Grammy-winning singer, an electrifying stage performer, and one the world's most recognizable and popular entertainers.",
      "The statue was revealed during a ceremony at a park in Brownsville, located about an hour drive east of Memphis. The city of about 9,000 people is near Nutbush, the community where Turner went to school as a child. As a teen, she attended high school just steps from where the statue now stands.",
      "The statue shows Turner with her signature wild hairdo and holding a microphone, as if she was singing on stage. It was designed by sculptor Fred Ajanogha, who said he tried to capture her flexibility of movement on stage, how she held the microphone with her index finger extended, and her hair style, which he compared to the \u201cmane of a lion.\u201d",
      "Turner died May 24, 2023 at age 83 after a long illness in her home in K\u00fcsnacht near Zurich. Her Grammy-winning singing career included the hit songs \u201cNutbush City Limits,\u201d \u201cProud Mary,\u201d \u201cPrivate Dancer,\u201d and \u201cWe Don\u2019t Need Another Hero,\u201d from the film \u201cMad Max Beyond Thunderdome.\u201d Her movie credits also include \u201cTommy\u201d and \u201cLast Action Hero.\u201d",
      "Turner teamed with husband Ike Turner for hit records and live shows in the 1960s and \u201970s. She survived her troubled marriage to succeed in middle age with the chart-topping \u201cWhat\u2019s Love Got To Do With It,\u201d released in 1984.",

The statue was sculpted in clay by Ajanogha in Atlanta and cast in bronze by a West Tennessee foundry, and it took about a year to complete. It is 7 feet and 9 inches tall with a base of 2 feet, making it stand about 10 feet high (3 meters).",
      "Karen Cook said she traveled from Georgia to attend the event with her friend, a cousin of Turner's, to honor the legendary performer.",
      "\u201cShe's a great artist, I love her music,\u201d said Cook, 59. \u201cMy mom listened to her a lot. It's a big deal and a great thing for the community to have Tina Turner in her small town.\u201d",
      "About 50 donors gave money for the statue, including Ford Motor Co., which donated $150,000. Ford is building an electric truck factory in nearby Stanton.",
      "The statue stands near a museum honoring Turner at the the West Tennessee Delta Heritage Center in Brownsville. The museum opened in 2014 inside the renovated Flagg Grove School, a one-room building where Turner attended classes in Nutbush. The school closed in the 1960s and was used as a barn before the dilapidated building was moved by tractor-trailer from Nutbush to Brownsville.",

      "Senate Democrats have struggled for months to counter President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats who have struggled for months to counter President Donald Trump have settled on a bold, one-step strategy if they do not get significant concessions on health care before government funding runs out Wednesday: voting to shut down the government.",
      "The plan is heartily endorsed by many frustrated voters in the base and party activists, some of whom called on Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York to resign in March after he provided support for Republicans to keep the government open at that time.",
      "\u201cAmerica\u2019s ability to endure this moment requires a Democratic Party driving a vibrant, impactful and public resistance,\u201d Katie Bethell, executive director of liberal grassroots group MoveOn, wrote in a letter to party leaders.",
      "Less clear is what\u2019s in the minority party's playbook after 12:01 a.m. EDT Wednesday, when the shutdown would start and the administration could begin laying off hundreds or even thousands of federal workers, if it carries through with plans laid out by the White House this week.",
      "How does it all end? And what do Democrats do then?",
      "Publicly, Democrats say they believe Trump and Republicans will bear the blame if there is a shutdown and that they eventually would be forced to negotiate a compromise. That is a risky bet.",
      "Republicans hold the majority in both the House and Senate and have shown no signs of relenting as Democrats insist on an immediate extension of health care benefits that expire at the end of the year, among other demands.",
      "Democrats have also adopted a somewhat resigned view of the choice ahead.",
      "The country \u201cwill get worse with or without\u201d a shutdown, Schumer said this month. \u201cBecause Trump is lawless.\u201d It\u2019s an uncertain endgame and an about-face for Democrats who in the past have strenuously opposed shutdowns that were instigated by Republicans.",
      "An extended shutdown with mass firings of federal workers would be a major escalation in the annual spending battles between the two parties. The threat of government closure \u2014 and the potential political ramifications \u2014 has generally scared both sides enough to bring everyone to the negotiating table, eventually.",
      "\u201cFunding the government is a Democrat equity, at least it always has been,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who has declined to negotiate with Democrats unless they help pass the seven-week extension of government funding that has cleared the House. \u201cAnd here they are steering us off that cliff.\u201d",
      "The most recent shutdown \u2014 the nation\u2019s longest \u2014 was in the winter of 2018-19, when Trump was insisting on federal dollars to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall during his first term. It ended when he backed down after 35 days.",
      "Schumer says things have changed since his March vote to help fund the government through the summer.",
      "Republicans passed a massive tax bill that cut Medicaid spending, and Trump has repeatedlyblocked federal spending that was previously approved by Congress. Democrats say Republicans have not reached out to negotiate, and they criticized Trump for canceling a White House meeting with Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.",
      "It appears the president may have reversed course, as he now plans to meet with Schumer, Jeffries, Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday.",
      "\u201cThis president is just \u2014 he\u2019s not up to being president if he can\u2019t sit down and negotiate with the two Democratic leaders,\u201d Schumer said on PBS' \u201cNews Hour\u201d this week.",

      "Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., voted with Republicans in a test vote, and nine other Democrats voted with Schumer and Republicans on the March resolution. Republicans would need at least six additional Democrats, potentially more, to reach the necessary 60 votes for passage.",
      "Schumer has a lot to lose either way, after taking a political thumping from liberal groups, and many voters, in the spring.",
      "A groundswell of angst and frustration has been simmering for months among the Democratic base, driven by Republicans\u2019 tightening grip on Washington and a growing perception that the Democratic Party is too weak to fight back. Now, with federal closures looming, many activists and lawmakers see a rare point of leverage and a chance to recast the party\u2019s image with voters.",
      "\u201cIt would be naive to suggest that all the trust that Democratic elected officials have lost and squandered with their base voters can be regained in one moment or one fight,\u201d said Joel Payne, chief of communications for MoveOn. \u201cBut I think it will go a long way to really start to reverse that relationship.\u201d",

      "Thieves who made off with 12,000 bottles of craft whiskey in a rare U.S. liquor heist this summer did more than just snag nearly $1 million worth of product -- they also spirited away nearly half the stock of a single malt distillers had worked for more than a decade to make.",
      "Now the Skagit Valley Sheriff\u2019s Office is investigating, and whiskey aficionados are wondering if \u2014 and where \u2014 the coveted bottles of Westland Distillery's first 10-year Garryana whiskey might turn up.",
      "The bottles disappeared July 31, when someone in a freight truck showed up at Westland Distillery\u2019s warehouse in Burlington, Washington, holding the paperwork that purportedly gave them the right to pick up a shipment of Westland single malt, Watchpost blended, and Garryana whiskies bound for New Jersey.",
      "But the bottles never arrived at their intended destination, and the \u201csophisticated, fraudulent carrier scheme\u201d was discovered a week later, said Jason Moore, the managing director of the Seattle-based distillery.",
      "The 10th anniversary edition bottles of Garryana are irreplaceable, said Moore.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and pretty extraordinary situation,\u201d said Moore.",
      "The Skagit County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to a phone message left by The Associated Press.",
      "It could be difficult to sell the stolen goods, said Mark Gillespie, the host of the WhiskyCast podcast who has published more than 3,800 tasting notes for different whiskey varieties.",
      "\u201cIt's going to be really hard for whoever took this to actually get this onto the market, because what they took was so rare that everybody knows about it,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cWe see these thefts occasionally in Scotland, where thieves will steal a trailer full of whiskey \u2014 and it usually ends up in Russia.\u201d",
      "But getting 12,000 bottles out of the U.S. could be difficult because the bottles are rare and recognizable, and flipping them in the U.S. may be tough because of the nation's three-tier system for alcohol sales. Distilleries generally have to sell liquor to distributors or wholesalers, who then sell to retailers and restaurants and bars. Selling alcohol on the secondary market \u2014 such as when individuals buy up popular bottles and then resell them for a profit \u2014 is generally illegal.",
      "That's not true in much of Europe, where auction houses and other businesses specialize in secondary market sales.",

So for a craft distillery to be able to release a 10-year-old is an accomplishment.\u201d",
      "Westland focuses on single-malt whiskeys, a style of liquor made from barley, similar to a Scotch whiskey. But Moore says Westland has worked hard to capture the terroir of the Pacific Northwest inside each bottle, using locally produced grains, peat harvested from an Olympic peninsula bog and a specific type of yeast selected to bring out the regional flavors.",
      "That\u2019s what makes the Garryana special, he said \u2014 it's aged in casks made from the Quercus garryana oak tree, which grows primarily in the Pacific Northwest.",
      "The limited-edition whiskey regularly wins awards, said Gillespie, and the 2023 edition was named the third best whiskey in the world by Whisky Advocate magazine. The Garryana sells out every year, Gillespie said, and with 3,000 of this year's 7,500-bottle release gone, the price on the secondary market will be driven up.",
      "Moore said the company has taken additional steps to protect its supply chain, and right now they are focusing on serving customers instead of the investigation.",
      "\u201cWhat happens from there is outside of our control, and we get excited about sharing our whiskey and engaging with the supporters we have,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThis is an extremely rare thing, and while it's a setback, we're confident that we're going to get to share this whiskey. We're proud to make something people enjoy.\"",
      "Losing $1 million in stock would put a lot of distilleries out of business, but Gillespie said he expects Westland to make it through the loss, in part because it was acquired by the Paris-based Remy Cointreau Group in 2016. Still, he has some advice for people eager to get a taste of Westland's products: Stick to the legal supply chains.",
      "\u201cIf somebody tries to offer you a case of Westland whiskey right now, I'd call the cops,\u201d Gillespie said.",

      "With Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in its fourth year, U.S. President Donald Trump said this week that he believed Kyiv can win back all the territory it has lost.

      "The appeal, shared with The Associated Press on Saturday, sets in motion a process at the high court that could lead to a definitive ruling from the justices by early summer on whether the citizenship restrictions are constitutional.",

      "An Indonesian archipelago that's home to three-fourths of Earth's coral species, a stretch of Icelandic coast with 70% of the country's plant life and an area along Angola's Atlantic coast featuring savannahs, forests and estuaries are among 26 new UNESCO-designated biosphere reserves.",
      "The United Nations cultural agency says the reserves \u2014 785 sites in 142 countries, designated since 1971 \u2014 are home to some of the planet\u2019s richest and most fragile ecosystems. But biosphere reserves encompass more than strictly protected nature reserves; they're expanded to include areas where people live and work, and the designation requires that scientists, residents and government officials work together to balance conservation and research with local economic and cultural needs.",
      "\u201cThe concept of biosphere reserves is that biodiversity conservation is a pillar of socioeconomic development\u201d and can contribute to the economy, said Ant\u00f3nio Abreu, head of the program, adding that conflict and misunderstanding can result if local communities are left out of decision-making and planning.",
      "The new reserves, in 21 countries, were announced Saturday in Hangzhou, China, where the program adopted a 10-year strategic action plan that includes studying the effects of climate change, Abreu said.",
      "The new reserves include a 52,000-square-mile (135,000-square-kilometer) area in the Indonesian archipelago, Raja Ampat, home to over 75% of earth\u2019s coral species as well as rainforests and rare endangered sea turtles. The economy depends on fishing, aquaculture, small-scale agriculture and tourism, UNESCO said.",
      "On Iceland's west coast, the Sn\u00e6fellsnes Biosphere Reserve's landscape includes volcanic peaks, lava fields, wetlands, grasslands and the Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull glacier. The 1,460-square-kilometer (564 square-mile) reserve is an important sanctuary for seabirds, seals and over 70% of Iceland's plant life \u2014 including 330 species of wildflowers and ferns. Its population of more than 4,000 people relies on fishing, sheep farming and tourism.",
      "And in Angola, the new Qui\u00e7ama Biosphere Reserve, along 206 kilometers (128 miles) of Atlantic coast is a \u201csanctuary for biodiversity\u201d within its savannahs, forests, flood plains, estuaries and islands, according to UNESCO. It's home to elephants, manatees, sea turtles and more than 200 bird species. Residents' livelihoods include livestock herding, farming, fishing, honey production.",
      "Residents are important partners in protecting biodiversity within the reserves, and even have helped identify new species, said Abreu, the program's leader. Meanwhile, scientists also are helping to restore ecosystems to benefit the local economy, he said.",
      "For example, in the Philippines, the coral reefs around Pangatalan Island were severely damaged because local fishermen used dynamite to find depleted fish populations. Scientists helped design a structure to help coral reefs regrow and taught fishermen to raise fish through aquaculture so the reefs could recover.",
      "\u201cThey have food and they have also fish to sell in the markets,\u201d said Abreu.",
      "In the African nation of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, a biosphere reserve on Pr\u00edncipe Island led to restoration of mangroves, which help buffer against storm surges and provide important habitat, Abreu said.",

      "The agency is using satellite imagery and computer modeling to monitor changes in coastal zones and other areas, and is digitizing its historical databases, Abreu said. The information will be used to help determine how best to preserve and manage the reserves.",

      "Both species are native to the forests of South America, which is why the new habitat features a thick canopy of trees. The golden tamarins, with their distinct orange mane, love frolicking in the treetops, while the sloths are perfectly happy hanging from the trees.",
      "\u201cMaybe the golden tamarins think of the sloth as more furniture because they don\u2019t really do too much. They\u2019re more sedentary,\u201d said Devin Clarke, a senior supervisor at the zoo. \"They like to sleep during the day, a little bit more active at night. So just watching, you know, like their couch walking around at night isn\u2019t too scary for them.\u201d",
      "The habitat, which opened in late August, offers the sloths and tamarins a unique space to interact with one another \u2014 or mind their own business. The space features a network of vines, ropes and tunnels that encourages exploration, zoo officials said.",
      "\u201cJust being able to see them up close and personal is really a way to inspire connection,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cAnd once people start really having that connection and harboring that connection with the wild animal, they\u2019re able to look at their lives and say, \u2018What can I do differently to help these animals\u2019 wild counterparts down in Brazil and Central America thrive?\u2019\u201d",
      "He said that in the 1970s, there were less than 200 golden tamarinds in the wild. Some 40 zoos accredited through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums put together a plan to rerelease the species into the wild. Their numbers topped 5,000 as of last year, he said.",
      "The previous tamarin habitat at the zoo was a little smaller, Clarke said.",

      "More than 600,000 of Alaska\u2019s roughly 740,000 residents are set to receive this year\u2019s check. To qualify, one must meet residency and other requirements.",
      "Three times, including last year, Alaskans received an energy relief payment along with their dividends, according to the state.",
      "For some Alaskans, the check is a nice extra. Some put it into college funds or savings accounts or donate to charities. Others rely on it for necessities, such as heating oil, winter tires or snowmachines, which are critical modes of transportation in rural villages where residents rely on hunting or trapping.",
      "Canoy, a single mom of two, is selling her home and downsizing. She had planned to fill her home's fuel tank as a gift to the new buyers at closing, but the fuel truck came early while she was away. So instead of putting the $3,000 her family is receiving toward other projects, as she'd hoped, she's using it to pay that bill. She plans to let her sons spend the remaining $400.",
      "Canoy said she lives comfortably and sees the dividend as a blessing. Still, she wishes lawmakers would find a better way to set the amounts \u2014 \"at least to just give Alaskans maybe a little peace of mind that, yeah, we\u2019re actually doing everything that we can to make sure that you guys get the most out of the permanent fund dividend.\u201d",

      "American soybean farmers are worried about where they're going to sell their crops and whether they'll lose money this year because China hasn't bought any for months",
      "MAGNOLIA, Ky. -- The leafy soybean plants reach Caleb Ragland's thighs and are ripe for harvest, but the Kentucky farmer is deeply worried. He doesn't know where he and others like him will sell their crop because China has stopped buying.",
      "Beijing, which traditionally has snapped up at least a quarter of all soybeans grown in the U.S., is in effect boycotting them in retaliation for the high tariffs President Donald Trump has imposed on Chinese goods and to strengthen its hand in negotiations over a new overall trade deal.",
      "It has left American soybean farmers fretting over not only this year's crop but the long-term viability of their businesses, built in part on China's once-insatiable appetite for U.S. beans.",
      "\u201cThis is a five-alarm fire for our industry,\u201d said Ragland, who leads the American Soybean Association trade group.",
      "The situation might even be enough to test farmers\u2019 loyalty to Trump, although he still enjoys strong support throughout rural America. If no deal is reached soon, they hope the government will come through with aid as it did during Trump's first term, but they see that only as a temporary solution. Trump said Thursday he is considering an aid package.",
      "U.S. and Chinese officials have held four rounds of trade talks between May and September, with another likely in the coming weeks. No progress on soybeans has been reported.",
      "Getting closer to harvest, \u201cI\u2019m honestly getting worried that the time is running out,\u201d said Jim Sutter, CEO of the U.S. Soybean Export Council.",
      "After Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, China responded with tariffs of its own, which now total up to 34% on U.S. soybeans. That makes soybeans from other countries cheaper.",
      "China's retaliatory tariffs also hit U.S. growers of sorghum, corn and cotton, and even geoduck divers have been affected. But soybeans stand out because of the crop\u2019s outsized importance to U.S. agricultural exports. Soybeans are the top U.S. food export, accounting for about 14% of all farm goods sent overseas.",
      "And China has been by far the largest foreign buyer. Last year, the U.S. exported nearly $24.5 billion worth of soybeans, and China accounted for more than $12.5 billion. That compared with $2.45 billion by the European Union, the second-largest buyer. This year, China hasn't bought beans since May.",
      "With U.S. farmers hurting, the Trump administration is under growing pressure to reach a deal with China. As talks drag on, Trump appears ready to help.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to take some of the tariff money \u2014 relatively small amount, but a lot for the farmers \u2014 and we\u2019re going to help the farmers out a little bit\u201d during this transition period, Trump said.",
      "The only way most farmers survived Trump\u2019s trade war in his first term was with tens of billions of dollars in government payments. But that's not what most farmers want.",
      "\u201cThe American farmer, especially myself included, we don\u2019t want aid payments,\u201d said Brian Warpup, 52, a fourth-generation farmer from Warren, Indiana. \u201cWe want to work. We work the land, we harvest the land, the crop off the land. And the worst thing that we could ever want is a handout.\u201d",
      "Farmers are looking to Trump for a long-term solution.",
      "\u201cOverwhelmingly, farmers have been in President Trump\u2019s corner,\u201d said Ragland, the president of the soybean association. \u201cAnd I think the message that our soybean farmers as a whole want to deliver is: \u2018President Trump, we\u2019ve had your back. We need you to have ours now.\u2019\u201d",
      "He said farmers appreciate the willingness to provide some short-term relief, but what they ultimately need are strong, reliable markets. \u201cOur priority remains seeing the United States secure lasting trade agreements \u2014 particularly with China \u2014 that allow farmers to sell their crops and build a sustainable future with long-term customers,\u201d he said.",

Trump's tariffs, which helped make their crops uncompetitive around the world, drove prices down further. And tariffs on steel and fertilizer sent costs up even more.",
      "Darin Johnson, president of the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, said he still has faith in the Trump administration to reach a good trade deal with China.",
      "\u201cI think where the patience is probably wearing thin is the time,\u201d said Johnson, a fourth-generation farmer. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody thought that we were going to take this much time because we were told 90 deals, 90 deals in 90 days.\u201d",
      "The U.S. soybean industry grew in response to Chinese demand starting back in the 1990s, when China began its rapid economic rise and turned to foreign producers to help feed its people. Protein-rich soybeans are an essential part of the diet.",
      "While China relies on domestic crops for steamed beans and tofu, it needs far more soybeans for oil extraction and animal feed. In 2024, China produced 20 million metric tons of soybeans, while importing more than 105 million metric tons.",
      "American farmers have come to count on China as their biggest customer, and this has \u201cgiven the Chinese a point of leverage,\u201d Sutter said. By holding off on buying U.S. soybeans, China is seen as trying to leverage that purchasing power in the trade talks.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s the strategy,\u201d said Sutter of the U.S. Soybean Export Council. \u201cI think that\u2019s why China is targeting soybeans and other agricultural products, because they know that farmers have a strong lobby and farmers are important to the U.S. government.\u201d",
      "Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, didn\u2019t answer specific questions on soybean purchases but urged the U.S. to work with Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe essence of China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation is mutual benefit and win-win,\u201d Liu said.",
      "China turned to Brazil when Trump launched his first trade war in 2018. Last year, Brazilian beans accounted for more than 70% of China's imports, while the U.S. share was down to 21%, World Bank data shows. Argentina and other South American countries also are selling more to China, which has diversified to boost food security.",
      "U.S. farmers also are broadening their customer base, said Sutter, who recently traveled to Japan and Indonesia in search of new markets. Taiwan pledged to purchase $10 billion worth of soybeans, corn, wheat and beef in the next four years.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s strong diversification efforts underway,\u201d Sutter said. But \u201cChina is so big, it\u2019s hard to replace them overnight.\u201d",
      "Farmers are working to boost consumption at home, too. Growth in biodiesel production has taken in some of the soybeans that were once exported. Others are crushed to produce soybean oil and soybean meal. The United Soybean Board is investing in research into the benefits of using soybeans to feed dairy cows and hogs.",
      "But Iowa farmer Robb Ewoldt, a director with the Soybean Board, knows that such domestic uses are growing gradually.",
      "\u201cWe cannot replace a China in one shot,\u201d Ewoldt said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen. We need to be realistic in that.\u201d",

On the contrary, we want president Trump (to) exercise his leadership to pull North Korea to dialogue table.\u201d",
      "Since Trump returned to power in January, he has repeatedly expressed hope of restarting talks with Kim.

      "Sixteen states and the District of Columbia are suing the Trump administration over its threats to pull sexual education funding for curricula mentioning diverse gender identities",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Sixteen states and the District of Columbia sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Friday, alleging that its threats to pull sexual education funding over curricula mentioning diverse gender identities were a violation of federal law.",
      "The complaint filed in federal court in Oregon says the department is attempting to force the states to \u201crewrite sexual health curricula to erase entire categories of students\" and describes the action as \u201cthe latest attempt from the current administration to target and harm transgender and gender-diverse youth.\u201d",
      "HHS did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.",
      "Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, his administration has sought to recognize people as only male or female.",
      "HHS wants to prohibit the inclusion of what it describes as \u201cgender ideology\u201d in lessons funded by the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) and the Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education (SRAE) program. The federal grants are used to teach about abstinence and contraception for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.",
      "The plaintiffs say the grant conditions HHS is seeking to impose violate federal law, the separation of powers and Congress' spending power. The termination of funding under the two federal grant programs could result in a loss of at least $35 million to the plaintiff states, according to the complaint.",
      "HHS warned states in August that they had 60 days to change lessons or lose their PREP grants. California was warned previously, and its $12 million grant was stripped Aug. 21.",

      "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said the \u201cchoice between losing funding and cutting sexual health education programs or excluding the transgender community from those programs is unacceptable.\u201d",

    "summary": "Part of the 1960s British pop invasion that began with The Beatles, The Zombies took a lot longer for success to catch up with them. Now their most famous album, 1968's \"Odessey and Oracle,\" has been remastered.",
    "story": [
      "Remember when radio DJs used to say a hit song was \"number one with a bullet\"?\u00a0 Well, this one was the slowest bullet in rock history. \"Time of the Season,\" by The Zombies, released in March 1968, reached #3 on the Billboard charts a full year later.",
      "Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone are in their 80s now. In their teens they were members of The Zombies, part of the 1960s British pop invasion that began with The Beatles, except that, for The Zombies, success took a lot longer to catch up with them.",
      "Of the five original Zombies, four survive: Argent, Blunstone, Hugh Grundy and Chris White. The fifth member, Paul Atkinson, died in 2004.",
      "\"We were friends, really, right from the very start,\" said Agent.",
      "\"It just clicked, yeah, it really did,\" said Grundy.",
      "White added, \"And we're still friends!\"",
      "They first got the band together at a youth club in their hometown just north of London, where a local artist has now finally put up a mural of them.",
      "But boy, was it a bumpy road to rock 'n' roll immortality.",
      "The first song Argent wrote was \"She's Not There,\" about unrequited adolescent love (is there another kind?). It was the making of them.",
      "\"She's Not There\" made it onto \"Juke Box Jury,\" a British is-it-a-hit-or-a-miss TV show, where one of the panelists loved it: \"I think it's a hit,\" he said. That panelist was George Harrison of The Beatles. It didn't hurt.",
      "The song went to #1 on the Cash Box chart, and #2 in Billboard.",
      "\"It was on the 9 o'clock news,\" said Argent. \"They said The Zombies had become the first group after The Beatles to have a number one record with a self-written composition\" - the song Argent wrote - \"Yeah, I'm in heaven!.\"",
      "\"She's Not There\" wasn't just a hit; it was their ticket to ride. They went to America, and hit the road with the Dick Clark Caravan of Stars. \"This was a dream come true for us,\" said Blunstone.",
      "Grundy said, \"We were terrified because here we were taking a lot of their influence, and there we were on stage with these fabulous artists going, 'Can we do this, can we even play with them?'\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel you were being imposters bringing American-style rhythm and blues music back to America?\"",
      "\"With English accents!\" said White.",
      "\"We thought exactly that,\" Argent replied. \"But they saw us as doing something really quite different. But we realize now that we did really have something quite original. We really did have our own stamp.\"",
      "But there was a problem: Money. There wasn't any.",
      "Blunstone said, \"We were 19 years old, we were very na\u00efve, and we didn't realize what our options were. So, I'm afraid that touring revenue was poor. Sometimes non-existent!\"",
      "Not only that, they felt their music had stagnated and suffered. They decided to produce their own album, in their own way. They went to the mothership of British rock, the famous Abbey Road Studios in London.",
      "Returning there, Blunstone said, \"You do get this really emotional feeling walking into it. Because, I mean, there's so much history in these walls.\"",
      "The session produced what became their signature album, \"Odessey and Oracle,\" now considered one of rock 'n' roll's greats. But not then. Then, it sank without a trace. \"There was no real interest in us,\" Argent said.",
      "Blunstone said, \"I thought we had a chance, but it became fairly clear fairly quickly that the industry pretty much ignored it, really.\"",
      "The Zombies thought it was all over and broke up. Blunstone took a job in insurance. Grundy sold cars. White and Argent wrote songs for other people, including this one for Argent's new band: \"Hold Your Head Up.\"",
      "But \"Odessey and Oracle\" wouldn't die. More than a year later, one of the tracks, \"Time of the Season,\" started to get some play.",
      "\"Famously there was one DJ in Boise, Idaho who kept playing 'Time of the Season,'\" said Blunstone. \"It spread to other radio stations. It took months for it to be a hit, but again, it went to number one in Cash Box.\"",
      "Finally, more than 50 years after their hits, The Zombies made it into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; and now, a remastered version of \"Odessey and Oracle\" has been released.",
      "\"Now,\" said Blunstone, \"it gets name-checked as a major influence in so many people's careers.\"",
      "\"Considered a Top 50 rock album, iconic rock album,\" I added.",
      "\"I know! And here we are. Is it nearly 70 years later? It's a very strange story.\"",
      "But a story with a happy ending. For The Zombies, their season has finally come.",

    "summary": "The actress talks about playing a screen goddess in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\"; her love of movie musicals; and her long road from the Bronx to Hollywood.",
    "story": [
      "The first thing you notice about Jennifer Lopez' perch over West Hollywood is the Old Hollywood part of it. Images of Barbra Streisand, Bette Davis and the Rat Pack all bedazzle the walls.",
      "\"I love making movies,\" she said, pointing to one photo. \"And I feel like this is me a little bit. But it's not me, it's Sophia Loren! And with the crew there, and this is what my life is: it's me by a camera doing this every day!\"",
      "Lopez is a movie mainstay. She's made at least one film almost every year for the past three decades. Some were memorable, others weren't. Golden Globes and Oscars both eluded her. But this year just might be different, due to \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" an old-fashioned musical. \"I just thought to myself, This is what I've been waiting for my whole life,\" she said. \"I grew up on musicals. My mom loved musicals, and so I saw every musical you can think of. She was a fanatic!\"",
      "I asked, \"How many times do you think you saw 'West Side Story'?\"",
      "\"So many,\" she sighed. \"And it wasn't, 'Oh I've seen it about five times.' No! I've seen it hundreds of times! I feel like, so much!\"",
      "No surprise one of her idols is Rita Moreno, the other the late Chita Rivera, who starred in \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" on Broadway \u2013 the same Tony-winning shoes that Lopez is now trying to fill.",
      "Does she feel the weight of that? \"I kind of let it go and understood that I had to make it my own,\" she said.",
      "It came, though, at a tough time in her personal life \u2013 Ben Affleck, her now ex-husband, is one of the film's executive producers. \"It was a really tough time,\" she said. \"Every moment on set, every moment I was doing this role, I was so happy. And then, it was like, back home it was not great. And it was just like, Oh, you know, how do I reconcile this?\"",
      "Their divorce was settled the same month that \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" premiered at Sundance. \"It was the best thing that ever happened to me,\" she said. \"Because it changed me \u2026 It didn't change me, it helped me grow in a way that I needed to grow.\"",
      "The bright music of \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" is a purposeful contrast to the film's darker tale. It's an escape for two cellmates in an Argentinian prison: Molina, a queer window dresser; and Valentin, a proud Marxist revolutionary. Going to a movie in their mind helped ease their drudgery, and dissolve their differences.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" click on the video player below:",
      "Lopez said, \"It is a love letter, in a way, to the Latin community and to the queer community, this movie, because in a time like this \u2026 those communities are being demonized and marginalized.\"",
      "Inclusion and acceptance have always been themes in her music. Performing at the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show in Miami, one of her twins, Emme (whom she had with her third husband Marc Anthony), sang with her proudly about the challenges of identity \u2013 cultural and otherwise. \"Singing that with my child there, and them screaming that back to me \u2013 'cause I'm gonna live my life \u2013 that was one of the best moments in my life,\" said Lopez, who then apologized for getting emotional thinking back on that. \"I didn't know it would catch me like that. It was one of the best moments of my life. Being so joyful and happy and being exactly who they were.\"",
      "The kind of global platform that she has now was unimaginable back when, against her parents' wishes, she dropped out of college and ran from her home in the Bronx chasing the city lights of Manhattan.",
      "With no place to stay, she slept on a bench at the Phil Black Dance Studio on Broadway. \"I crashed there for a while,\" she said. \"You know, when you're young you can do stuff like that. You don't know what's gonna happen to you.\"",
      "\"It's not an inconvenience,\" I said.",
      "\"No! You're like, whatever. Great! I can sleep here. I'll sleep here!\"",
      "As a kid, seeing a live Broadway show was a rare privilege, but the experience stuck. \"I remember sitting in an audience, watching a live show one time,\" she said. \"And I was with a friend, and I said, 'When you see that, don't you want to be up there, doing that?' And they were like, 'No!' And I was like, 'Okay. Is it just me?'\"",
      "In-between her auditions, Lopez was selling programs for \"Phantom of the Opera\" out in front of the Majestic Theatre. \"I was, like, really using my best tactics,\" she said. \"Like, I swing it up in the air and, like, you know, kind of try to be charming and funny!\"",
      "It was a winding road that finally got Jennifer Lopez to her own musical. It might just be that going back in time to Old Hollywood \u00a0-- is what pushes her Hollywood career forward.",
      "\"The hard times are the lessons, and you have to understand that,\" she said. \"You have to understand that. And once you do, everything just becomes a little bit lighter. And you can really, really fly.\"",
      "\"Does it feel like you're flying now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes. It does. It does,\" she replied. \"And I still feel like I want to fly higher. I want to see more. I want to do more things.\"",

      "\"Each diagnosis, each new case, will be a daunting and at times frightening experience for those individuals and their loved ones,\" Charles wrote in a booklet given to guests at Buckingham Palace event celebrating cancer charities in April 2025. \"But as one among those statistics myself, I can vouch for the fact that it can also be an experience that brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity.\"",

      "Makary's letter was also more tempered than Mr. Trump's comments during a news conference earlier this week in which the president said there's \"no downside in not taking\" Tylenol.",
      "\"Acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics,\" Makary wrote in his letter.",
      "There is concern among the medical community that, as a result of the FDA's announcement Monday, that some patients could turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News following the FDA's announcement. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "In a statement in response to the FDA's announcement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, \"Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" calling it \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "Oz also addressed Makary's announcement that the agency will approve the prescription drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid, to treat autism in children. Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"The key question is, if you, as a researcher on those trials, had a child, would you give that child leucovorin?\" Oz said he asked of researchers studying leucovorin. \"And when I asked the doctors on those trials, they said yes.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years,\u00a0according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no scientific consensus as to why.",
      "Oz said that when he, Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, were asked by the White House to examine the issue, they found two \"clues,\" not conclusions, that pointed to leucovorin as a possible treatment option for autistic children, and acetaminophen as a medication pregnant women should be cautious about taking.",
      "\"These are things that we believe, that if you're fully transparent about, you'll rebuild trust with the American people,\" Oz said. \"Just tell people what you know.\"",
      "Oz argued that Mr. Trump was right in pushing for the FDA to both approve leucovorin and make its Tylenol recommendation \u2014 even though there is no consensus in the medical community and no definitive evidence supporting either move \u2014 because he believes the FDA has an obligation to be transparent.",
      "But Oz was clear that patients should consult their doctors first before making a decision.",
      "\"The Tylenol issue is whether or not we should warn moms, who are pregnant today, about a problem that we may not know fully the answer to \u2014 'Is Tylenol a problem during pregnancy?' \u2014 for another five years,\" Oz said. \"Well, what about the kid today? Are you going to take the Tylenol or not. Well I think the answer is, the best prudent answer, of course take it if a doctor says you need it. But don't take it on your own without thinking twice about it.\"",
      "Oz also indicated that he would not advise a pregnant family member to take Tylenol without talking to their physician first.",
      "\"We're guarded in saying we don't have all the answers,\" he said. \"But if it's my family, I'm not going to have my pregnant daughter take acetaminophen if she doesn't need to be on it without certainly talking to a doctor about it.\"",
      "Sara  Moniuszko and \n                                                  \n                                  Dr. C\u00e9line  Gounder\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is warning consumers not to eat certain ready-to-eat pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe's stores because they may be contaminated with listeria bacteria previously linked to a deadly outbreak tied to pre-made chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals.",
      "In an announcement Thursday, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a public health alert for Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce sold at Walmart in refrigerated 12-ounce clear plastic trays. The products have best-by dates of Sept. 22 through Oct. 1 and may still be in consumers' refrigerators.",
      "In an update on Friday, the FSIS added to its public health alert some meals sold at Trader Joe's, the Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo, sold in 16-ounce plastic tray packages with \"best if used by\" dates of Sept. 20, Sept. 24 or Sept. 27. The products contain the establishment number \"P- 45288\" inside the USDA mark of inspection. The stores possibly affected are in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah, Trader Joe's said Friday.",
      "The affected meals from Walmart contain the establishment numbers \"EST. 50784\" and \"EST. 47718\" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the label. They were sent to Walmart stores nationwide.",
      "\"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have removed this product from our impacted stores and we are working with the supplier to investigate,\" a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News on Friday.",
      "There have been no reported illness complaints for the product in question and consumers should discard the meals if they have them and can receive a full refund at any Walmart store. Trader Joe's told customers to discard the product or return it to their local store for a full refund.",
      "\"We are issuing this guidance in an abundance of caution because testing of another brand with a shared ingredient source indicated this product may have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes,\" Trader Joe's said on its website. \"There have been no positive Listeria tests for the Trader Joe's product itself, and there have been no reports of illness associated with these production codes.\"",
      "No recall has been issued, but FreshRealm, a large food producer that distributed the products, said they advised Walmart this week to pull the meals from store shelves. Additional products may be identified, according to the FSIS.",
      "The meals may be contaminated with the same strain of listeria that caused an outbreak tied to chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Walmart and Kroger stores.\u00a0Four people were killed and at least 20 were sickened in the outbreak, which federal health officials updated on Friday evening. The outbreak led to a large recall this summer.",
      "\"FreshRealm held beef meatball marinara linguine meals after they tested positive for the outbreak strain,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0said in its update Friday. \"Pasta that went into the beef meatball marinara linguine meals has tested positive for Listeria, but additional information is pending to determine if the samples taken from the pre-cooked pasta is the same strain making people sick. Do not eat affected foods, return them or throw them out.\"",
      "FreshRealm conducted tests that detected the listeria in linguine used in the meatball dish, company officials said. The strain matched the listeria identified in the chicken fettuccine Alfredo outbreak, the company said.",
      "\"We have long maintained that the source of the listeria was likely an ingredient supplied by a third party,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The pasta came from Nate's Fine Foods of Roseville, California. The company did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.",
      "Listeria infections can cause serious illness, particularly in older adults, people with weakened immune systems, and those who are pregnant or their newborns. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, tiredness, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, according to the CDC.",

Federal officials in December said they were revamping protocols to prevent listeria infections after several high-profile outbreaks, including one linked to Boar's Head deli meats that led to 10 deaths and more than 60 illnesses last year.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariff-pharmaceutical-drugs-kitchen-cabinets-furniture-heavy-trucks/",
    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 20:29:37 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture and a 25% tariff on heavy trucks.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks.",
      "In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on \"any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product\" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either \"breaking ground\" or being \"under construction.\"",
      "In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.",
      "Still, some experts think the new pharma tariffs could end up having only a modest impact, noting that generic drugs are exempt. The loophole for drugmakers with operations in the U.S. is also likely to soften the blow, Neal Shearing, group chief economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the U.S. or have announced plans to build production in the near future,\" he said. \"Add in the fact that pharmaceuticals is the one area where we think there may have been significant inventory accumulation this year, as importers have sought to front-run potential tariffs, and the impact on the effective tariff rate is likely to be small.\"",
      "Higher costs for home furnishings?",
      "Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were \"flooding\" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied \"for National Security and other reasons.\"",
      "The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a \"major Tariff Investigation\" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced.",
      "The president said the 25% tariff on \"all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world\" was \"in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition.\"",
      "\"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump posted.",
      "Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after economic data this month showed the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.",
      "Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.",
      "\"There's no inflation,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday. \"We're having unbelievable success.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 18:09:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin within days, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap.",
      "And while some federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a self-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

    "summary": "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for\u00a0a deal\u00a0brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "\"With this executive order, you will be effectively bringing into effect the agreement that will save TikTok and ensure that it can operate safely and securely,\" White House staff secretary Will Scharf said ahead of a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.",
      "The move declares that the deal represents a \"qualified divestiture\" that satisfies a law passed by Congress requiring TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban and pushes back enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for an agreement on how the app operates in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during their call last week. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The TikTok deal",
      "Under the law, TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. Earlier this month, the president extended the enforcement pause until Dec. 16. The new order extends the pause until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "According to a senior White House official, under the deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, according to the White House. The executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by the divest-or-ban law.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said at the White House that the new entity would have a valuation of about $14 billion.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok, according to the White House. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The full roster of U.S. investors and their stakes in the company remain unclear, but Vance said Thursday the administration is planning to announce the other investors in the coming days.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "CBS News contributor Christopher Krebs, the former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said there are \"still some questions on how operationally ... it's going to play out and what the user is going to experience on a daily basis.\"",
      "There's been limited pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "Still, some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern Friday and said he has asked for an \"urgent\" briefing from the Trump administration.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",
      "The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress, however, left it up to the president to ultimately determine what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\" The law gives the president the power to decide, through an interagency process, whether \"the relevant foreign adversary controlled application [is] no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\" It defines \"controlled by a foreign adversary\" as a company headquartered in a foreign adversary country and owning at least a 20% stake.",
      "According to the executive order, the joint venture resolves national security concerns because ByteDance will have a minority stake; the joint venture will operate the algorithm and code and make content-moderation decisions; the data of U.S. users will be stored in a cloud environment run by an American company; and the arrangement includes \"intense monitoring\" of software updates, algorithms and data.",
      "\"These safeguards would protect the American people from the misuse of their data and the influence of a foreign adversary, while also allowing the millions of American viewers, creators, and businesses that rely on the TikTok application to continue using it,\" it says.",
      "The interagency process was led by Vance and included consultation with the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Treasury Department, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "\"This process has included, among other things, significant interagency deliberations and consultations, numerous briefings by informed experts and national security officials, and extensive negotiations with outside parties,\" the executive order says.",
      "The senior White House official said the administration plans to engage \"vigorously\" with lawmakers \"to show them what a great deal this is\" for Americans while also making the app \"safe and secure.\"",
      "During the legal battle over the law, TikTok's lawyers said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that global content will still be accessible for American users.",
      "For that to happen, the U.S. algorithm would have to interact with the original algorithm that feeds the rest of the world content, according to Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University.",
      "\"The semantics associated with how that'll work have not been disclosed at all,\" Lightman said.",
      "Lightman added that the level of complexity involved in retraining an algorithm to run off a smaller set of users and potentially weighting data sets differently while also maintaining the quality of the current user experience is \"huge.\"",
      "\"The TikTok algorithm has been optimized over a long period of time to understand its community's interests and what defines value for them,\" he said. \"It's kind of it's impossible to recreate.\"",

    "story": [
      "A pair of e-commerce entrepreneurs who bought a number of well-known retail brands \u2014 including RadioShack, Modell's Sporting Goods and Pier 1 Imports \u2014 out of bankruptcy are accused of running a Ponzi scheme.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.",
      "Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens 'n Things were also among their acquisitions.",
      "REV acquired RadioShack in 2020, three years after the nearly century-old electronics chain filed for its second bankruptcy. RadioShack first filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2015. In 2023, Unicomer Group acquired RadioShack, and in 2024, relaunched it as an e-commerce platform. RadioShack's current owners are not named in the lawsuit.",
      "Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in March 2020, when it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports \u2014 which still exists as an online store \u2014 declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.",
      "The SEC's suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, \"made material misrepresentations\" to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were \"on fire\" and that \"cash flow is strong.\" They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be invested in that specific firm. That proved not to be the case, according to the SEC's lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "\"Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits,\" the suit states. \"Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations.\"",
      "Neither Mehr nor Lopez immediately responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The SEC alleges that at least $5.9 million of returns paid to investors were actually Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors, as opposed to companies' profits.",
      "Additionally, the federal regulatory agency claims that Mehr and Lopez allocated $16 million worth of investments for their own use, according to the filing.",
      "REV Chief Operating Officer Maya Burkenroad is also accused of aiding Lopez and Mehr's alleged crimes. On REV's website, Burkenroad, who is Lopez's cousin, was described as having \"over 10 years of experience managing multi-million-dollar companies,\" according to the complaint.",
      "But the SEC claims Lopez and Mehr misrepresented her experience. Before joining REV, she had worked as a substitute preschool teacher, a promoter at a radio station, and as an assistant to Lopez at a prior endeavor, the complaint alleges.",

      "Working with IBM, the bank used a combination of classical computing and the tech giant's Heron quantum processor to deliver a 34% improvement in algorithmic bond price predictions, HSBC said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0shared Tuesday.",
      "Philip Intallura, HSBC's group head of quantum technologies, called the trial a \"ground-breaking world-first.\" He expanded on the technology in a company video included in the announcement, saying the improvement in trade predictions ultimately means \"increased margins and greater liquidity.\"",

It does not apply to future works.",
      "\"This is a fair settlement,\" Alsup said, though he added that distributing it to all parties will be \"complicated.\" About 465,000 books are on the list of works pirated by Anthropic, according to Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors.",

    "published": "Thu, 25 Sep 2025 15:38:01 -0400",
    "summary": "The Social Security Administration is transitioning to electronic payments next week after 85 years of issuing paper checks to U.S. retirees.",
    "story": [
      "After 85 years of sending out paper checks to retirees, the Social Security Administration (SSA) is transitioning to electronic payments in what it says is an effort to modernize its services and improve efficiency.",
      "Starting Sept. 30, the SSA will no longer issue paper checks to its nearly 70 million recipients, instead sending benefits through either direct deposit or a prepaid debit card.",
      "\"We have been communicating directly with beneficiaries since July 1, and we have worked diligently to ensure that the less than one percent of individuals who receive paper checks have ample time to enroll in direct deposit or receive Direct Express cards,\" a Social Security spokesperson told CBS News in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"By moving to electronic payments exclusively, we aim to improve efficiency, security, and ensure beneficiaries receive their monthly benefits promptly,\" they added.",
      "The Social Security Administration has emphasized that electronic payments provide a safer and more secure way to receive benefits compared with paper checks, which the agency says are 16 times more likely to be lost or stolen. Eliminating paper checks is also a cost-saving measure: Checks cost 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer.",
      "In an online post, the SSA said it was sending notices to people who receive paper checks to alert them of the change. The agency encouraged paper check recipients to switch to the new payment options before the deadline to ensure they receive their benefits in a timely fashion.",
      "The Social Security spokesperson declined to comment on how people were contacted or on the current status of its outreach.",
      "Exceptions for some paper checks",
      "While the agency is pulling away from paper checks, there are some exceptions. The spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that the agency will continue to issue paper checks to people who have no other way to receive payments, echoing what it\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0in July after it announced the move to electronic payments.",
      "\"The U.S. Department of the Treasury will grant exceptions to the rule for qualifying circumstances,\" the spokesperson said, without elaborating on what the qualifying circumstances are or the steps Social Security recipients would need to take to establish they qualify.",
      "President Trump set the shift away from paper checks in motion with a March executive order that mandated all federal payments be digitized. Paper-based checks, the White House said at the time, impose \"unnecessary costs; delays; and risks of fraud, lost payments, theft, and inefficiencies.\"",
      "Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, as well as advocates for seniors have noted that the roughly 600,000 people who rely on the SSA's original payment system often need paper checks because they're unable to receive electronic deposits.",
      "That includes people who are \"unbanked,\" or those who lack access to traditional bank accounts. According to an August report from Bankrate, the unbanked represent 4.6% of the U.S. population, and tend to rely more on check-cashing services and other alternative forms of payment to manage their finances.",
      "While the Social Security Act was signed into law in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it wasn't until\u00a01940\u00a0that the agency began sending paper checks to retired workers and their dependents as well as to survivors of deceased insured workers. The first recipient of the monthly benefit was a woman named Ida M. Fuller.",
      "A Vermont native, Fuller worked as a teacher before becoming a legal secretary. After filing her retirement claim in 1939, she stopped by the Social Security office in Rutland, Vermont, the town where she once attended school, to inquire about her benefits. She had paid into the relatively new program for about three years, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"It wasn't that I expected anything, mind you, but I knew I'd been paying for something called Social Security and I wanted to ask the people in Rutland about it,\" she said.",
      "Fuller's first monthly check, issued on January 31, 1940, was for $22.54.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle a Federal Trade Commission case over whether it duped customers into signing up for Prime and made it difficult for customers to cancel their membership.",
      "As part of the settlement, announced Thursday, Amazon will provide $1.5 billion in refunds to customers that were harmed by what FTC referred to as \"deceptive Prime enrollment practices.\" About 35 million Prime customers who were impacted by the practices could qualify for $51 each as part of the settlement, the FTC said in legal documents.",
      "Amazon is also required to pay a $1 billion civil penalty, the largest in any FTC rule violation case to date. The FTC said the $1.5 billion payout to customers is the second-highest restitution award in the agency's history.",
      "Prime customers who are eligible for the payout include those who may have signed up for a membership via the company's \"Single Page Checkout\" between June 23, 2019 to June 23, 2025. Amazon must distribute the payments to all affected customers within 90 days, according to the court order.",
      "\"The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,\" FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said in a statement, adding, \"Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans' pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again.\"",
      "Amazon neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the complaint, according to the legal documents. In a statement shared with CBS News, the company said Amazon and its executives have \"always followed the law\" and that the settlement allows them to \"move forward and focus on innovating for customers.\"",
      "In addition to offering compensation to impacted customers, the FTC said Amazon was also required to make changes to its Prime enrollment and cancellation practices, which documents showed that company executives and employees knowingly discussed. The changes included adding a \"clear and conspicuous\" button to its site for customers to decline a Prime membership offer.",
      "In addition, the e-commerce giant was told to make it easier for Prime members to cancel their membership.",
      "\"The process cannot be difficult, costly, or time-consuming,\" the FTC said in its statement.",
      "A spokesperson for Amazon said in an email that the changes outlined by the FTC press \"have already made, many of them years ago.\"",
      "The FTC's efforts to make it easier for customers to cancel subscriptions extend beyond Amazon. In 2024, the commission approved a \"click-to cancel rule,\" which would have allowed consumers to more quickly end streaming services, gym memberships, product deliveries and other subscriptions. The rule had been set to take effect July 14, but was blocked by a federal court that month.",
      "\"We hope the FTC resurrects the click-to-cancel rules to protect millions of consumers from shady sales tactics,\" said Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a nonprofit public interest group, in en email. \"In the meantime, we hope this Amazon settlement sends a strong message to any company operating in ways that could conceivably confuse customers or thwart their efforts to not be customers any more.\"",
      "Thursday's settlement, which came\u00a0two days after a jury trial kicked off in Seattle, represents the culmination of a two-year case that the FTC began in June 2023.",
      "Amazon Prime provides subscribers with perks that include faster shipping, video streaming and discounts at Whole Foods for a fee of $139 annually, or $14.99 a month.",
      "It's a key and growing part of Amazon's business, with more than 200 million members. In its latest financial report, the company\u00a0reported in July\u00a0that it booked more than $12 billion in net revenue for subscription services, a 12% increase from the same period last year.",
      "That figure includes annual and monthly fees associated with Prime memberships, as well as other subscription services such as its music and e-books platforms.",
      "In a separate case, the FTC is looking into whether Amazon has allegedly engaged in monopolistic behavior that allows it to inflate prices and suppress competition from rivals in violation of antitrust laws.",

Well, just because it didn't malfunction does not lead us to believe that there were not safety issues because we know something caused him to die,\" said famed civil rights attorney Ben Crump, whose law firm is representing the family.",
      "Karen Irwin, Universal Orlando Resort's president, said in her note that the internal findings showed ride systems functioned normally, equipment was intact and Universal workers followed the proper procedures. Investigators with the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said on September 19 that their initial findings align with that of the theme park.",

      "Amazon's most advanced fulfillment center, called SHV1, is located in Shreveport, Louisiana. It's more than 3 million square feet and one of the company's largest facilities that utilizes nearly 1,000 robots at the center.",
      "\"We have a number of different types of new robotics that we're using to fulfill customer orders,\" said Scott Dresser, Amazon's vice president of robotics.",

      "When a customer orders a product, the robots get to work.",
      "Some move the item out of storage. Then, one of the 2,500 employees sorts it while another packs it before it travels along some of the nearly 15 miles of conveyor belts to get labeled.",
      "The robots have different functions to help move and lift the packages. For example, the robot Proteus hauls pallets and orders across the facility floor, while Cardinal lifts packages into pallets set for delivery.",
      "\"Cardinal is lifting packages that weigh up to 50 pounds. \u2026 And then we can use Proteus to take the container over to the docks. So a lot of it's less about performance, more about making sure that our employees are safe,\" Dresser said.",

      "\"Every time we're able to grow and expand the network, which robotics has enabled over the last decade, we're able to add new jobs. \u2026 like our robotics maintenance engineers, people that we need in the operation now that we have these new robotics to help us run the building,\" he said.",
      "While Amazon's revenue has grown, its number of employees has held steady at around 1.5 million since 2022, according to the company's quarterly reports.",
      "\"I think the thing that we think of most when we're deploying a new fulfillment operation or a new process in a fulfillment operation, is how are people and robots best going to be able to do that together?\"",
      "Dresser added that Amazon is offering training for employees whose positions are being replaced and said those more advanced jobs pay better.",

The department had previously estimated second-quarter growth at 3.3%, and forecasters had expected a repeat of that figure.",
      "Consumer spending buoyed the economy in the second quarter, rising at a 2.5% pace, up from 0.6% in the first quarter and well above the 1.6% the government previously estimated. The data provides evidence that Americans continued to open their wallets despite broader economic headwinds such as tariffs and a slowing job market, economists noted.",
      "\"That was a meaningful bump-up from the previous estimate of 3.3% thanks to the mighty consumer,\" Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, senior economist at BMO, said in a Thursday report. \"Today's run of data suggest that the economy \u2014 which strongly rebounded after the pandemic recession \u2014 continues to hold up well, even as we anticipate some slowdown ahead.\"",
      "Spending on services advanced at a 2.6% annual pace, more than double the government's previous estimate of 1.2%.",
      "The stronger-than-expected GDP data provides evidence that the economy remains on a solid footing, which may dampen the Federal Reserve's enthusiasm for additional rate cuts in 2025 and early 2026, economists noted. The central bank last week issued its first rate cut of 2025 when it reduced\u00a0its benchmark rate by one-quarter point, with the Fed penciling in two additional cuts in 2025.",
      "When announcing the rate cut last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointed to a weakening labor market as prompting the move. Because rate reductions make it cheaper for businesses to borrow and expand, they can help bolster hiring and support the labor market.",

That trend reversed as expected in the second quarter: Imports fell at a 29.3% pace, boosting April-June growth by more than 5 percentage points.",
      "A category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength came in stronger than previously reported as well, growing 2.9% from April-June, up from 1.9% in the first quarter and in the government's previous estimate. This category includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.",
      "But private investment fell, including a 5.1% drop in residential investment. Declining business inventories took more than 3.4 percentage points off second-quarter growth.",
      "Spending and investment by the federal government fell at a 5.3% annual pace on top of a 5.6% drop in the first quarter.",
      "Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander, noted that GDP growth averaged 1.6% in the first half of 2025 and consumer spending 1.5% \u2014 \"not great but much better than initially thought.''",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has added double-digit taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country and targeted specific products for tariffs, including steel, aluminum and autos. The president sees tariffs as a way to protect American industry, lure factories back to the U.S. and to help pay for the tax cuts he signed into law July 4.",

      "Tariffs have already driven up the cost of some categories of goods for U.S. consumers. For example, in August, audio equipment rose in price by 12% compared to one year earlier,\u00a0 while the cost of household goods rose 10%, the latest Consumer Price Index report\u00a0shows.",
      "\"A wave of uncertainty is impacting not just retailers, but also consumers heading into the final quarter of the year. With hiring slowing across the board, Retailers may hire fewer workers themselves, while many of their shoppers slow spending,\" Challenger added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/h-1b-visa-new-fee-immigration-impact-american-workers/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:23:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The large fee could help some U.S. workers find jobs, but there could be longer-term costs, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says the new $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will spur companies to hire Americans instead of bringing in labor from overseas. Yet many economists predict the results will be more mixed, potentially fostering increased domestic hiring in some industries but slowing long-term economic growth with a knock-on effect on overall employment.",
      "\"I could envision a scenario in which otherwise available [American] employees see a large increase for their labor demand,\" Kirk Doran, associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, said of the new visa policy. \"There is some evidence that for the kind of work H-1B employees do, there are available workers looking for jobs right now.\"",
      "In the near term, some technology industry workers in particular could see job gains as more companies seek to avoid the sharply higher costs of bringing in employees from overseas, Rutgers University labor economist Jennifer Hunt told CBS News.",
      "\"The winners would be U.S. native-born computer programmers,\" she said. \"If you're a native worker who is really similar to an immigrant, immigrants are usually bad for you. So we would expect current American, U.S. programmers to be helped.\"",
      "Yet the bigger picture is more complex. Other economic research shows that hiring immigrant workers often benefits companies, providing a ready source of skilled labor with the education and training that may not be widely available in the U.S.",
      "One 2024 study from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment said H-1B workers can \"help firms increase their employment, revenues and survival probabilities,\" while finding no evidence that hiring of foreign labor through the program displaced native-born American workers.",
      "The research \u2014 from economists at IZA, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, University of Delaware, University of Michigan and Queens College, CUNY \u2014 also found that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains. \"High-wage, high-productivity firms expand more and even crowd-in natives with college degrees\" when able to add H-1B workers, they wrote.",
      "George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens underlined that H-1B workers with specialized skills can help boost a company's revenue and profits, potentially spawning other kinds of jobs at the employer, such as in sales and marketing, that can be filled by U.S. workers.",
      "As a result, Clemens worries that the policy change would hurt Americans' job prospects over the long term. \"It is going to choke off job opportunities for the people it is supposed to help,\" he said.",
      "Cost of restricting immigration",
      "To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company. Congress caps the number of H-1B visas \u2014 which are valid for three years and which can be extended for an additional three years \u2014 at 85,000 annually. Roughly 700,000 workers in the U.S. hold H-1B visas, according to Capital Economics.",
      "\"The costs of restricting immigration are widespread,\" Gaurav Khanna, a University of California San Diego professor of economics focusing on migration, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"On net, it benefits U.S. workers more than it hurts them, such that the benefits outweigh the costs. The visas allow the IT companies to grow quite rapidly, and these IT firms start hiring other workers in management positions and in HR, so it leads to employment growth at these firms.\"",
      "The White House dismissed the notion that hiring workers from abroad also benefits U.S. workers.",
      "\"President Trump continues to prove to so-called 'experts' wrong time and time again \u2013 no 'economic study' can change the reality lived by many Americans across the country who bore the brunt of the massive abuse of the H-1B system,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "Rogers added that the visa fee protects \"Americans from cheap, foreign labor.\"",
      "In a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump said H-1B visas disadvantage Americans by allowing companies to exploit the program to \"replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\" That has stunted job opportunities and undermined wages, he added.",
      "How much do H-1B workers earn?",
      "Some research supports this claim. For example, an August analysis\u00a0from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, found that H-1B workers earn significantly less than their American counterparts.",
      "\"[M]any employers may be using the H-1B program not to attract top-tier global talent, but to fill roles at below-median wage levels\u2014raising questions about the program's alignment with its stated objectives,\" the report said.",
      "Other changes could be coming to the H-1B program, with the Trump administration aiming to tilt it toward better-paid foreign workers. On Monday, it proposed replacing the lottery with a system that would favor immigrants with advanced skills and higher incomes.",
      "The Heritage report also notes that the visas restrict worker mobility by tying a visa holder to a given company, preventing them from seeking other employment. That can make such workers more desirable to employers than native workers, who can leave their jobs at any time, the report explains.",
      "In this sense, companies' reliance on the program can hurt native workers, the group said.",
      "\"But this creates an uneven playing field: Native workers, who are free to switch jobs or negotiate better pay, may be overlooked not because they lack skills, but because they are not as easily retained or controlled,\" wrote Alexander Frei, the report's author and formerly a senior research associate at Heritage. \"As a result, employers may favor visa-bound workers who accept lower wages and fewer demands, driving down bargaining power and wage growth for equally or more qualified U.S. workers.\"",
      "Other groups have\u00a0criticized the H-1B program for disproportionately benefiting large, multinational firms that can enter thousands of visa applicants in the lottery and hire whomever is successful.",

      "U.S. District Judge Melissa Damian ruled Friday that the consumers who filed the class-action lawsuit failed to show that the lack of confectionary details on the chocolate and peanut butter candies, such as missing mouths and eyes on jack-'o-lanterns, ghosts and other Halloween-themed figures, had cause them economic harm.",
      "Damian pointed out that while the consumers may have been disappointed by the chocolates' unwrapped appearances, the candies were not \"so flawed as to render them worthless.\" In other words, the chocolate still tasted like chocolate, even if they weren't as haunting as the purchasers had expected from the packaging.",
      "The lawsuit focused on several Hershey candies that are marketed around Halloween, including its Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins and its Reese's White Ghost, as well as a few other holiday-themed chocolates like its Reese's Peanut Butter Shapes Assortment Snowmen Stockings Bells.",
      "The original lawsuit, filed in 2024, claimed that Hershey used deceptive advertising because the \"artistic designs\" depicted on the wrappers were absent from the actual candies.",
      "But the difference between the wrappers and the chocolates' actual appearances wasn't enough to prove \"a concrete economic injury,\" Damian wrote on Friday.",
      "\"Plaintiffs' conclusory allegations as to why they have allegedly been deprived of the benefit of their bargain all boil down to their subjective, personal expectations of how the products would or should have looked when unpackaged,\" the judge added.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 11:14:55 -0400",
    "summary": "The Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" spending and tax law will result in cuts to food stamp benefits for many Americans, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people who receive food stamps could soon see smaller benefits or even get kicked out of the program due to changes that are starting to roll out from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, according to several analyses from the federal government and public policy think tanks.",
      "About 2.4 million people, or about 6% of enrollees, could lose access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), in an average month, because of the new law's changes, which include stricter work requirements, the Congressional Budget Office estimated last month.",
      "Millions more will see their monthly benefit amounts shrink because of other changes mandated by the law, such as a new restrictions on how an individual's benefits are calculated, it added. The total pool of people who will either be cut off from SNAP or see smaller monthly benefits could reach 22.3 million U.S. families, according to a July analysis from the Urban Institute.",
      "About 42 million individuals in 22.3 million households received food stamps in 2023, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report on the program.",
      "While SNAP is funded by the USDA, every U.S. state is in charge of administering the program to its residents, with those administrative costs split between the federal and state governments. Some states are already beginning to implement some of the new law's food stamp restrictions, such as Pennsylvania, which is mandating the stricter work rules starting Nov. 1.",
      "The changes are arriving at a precarious time for many, with grocery costs continuing to rise and poverty rates inching higher for senior citizens and Black Americans, according to new Census data. Anti-hunger advocates warn that reduced SNAP benefits could worsen food insecurity, undermining one of the nation's most effective safety nets credited with lifting 3.6 million people out of poverty last year, according to U.S. Census data.",
      "\"We are deeply concerned that the cuts to SNAP will lead to an increase in hunger,\" Carolyn Vega, associate director of policy analysis for Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger nonprofit, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You are looking at households that don't have a lot of extra wiggle room in their budget, so that makes every SNAP dollar very precious in extending that food budget.\"",
      "Tracking the impact of those SNAP cuts on food insecurity as the changes unfurl over the coming months and years may be difficult, given the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Sept. 20 announcement that it is halting its annual Household Food Security Report, which measures whether American families have access to healthy food.",
      "The USDA said it is nixing the report because it is \"redundant, costly, politicized and extraneous\" and leads to \"fear mongering.\" But anti-hunger advocates say scrapping the report could ultimately obscure the impact of the Republicans' cuts to the food stamp program.",
      "\"I don't see how it's redundant \u2014 the USDA puts out the only report on food insecurity,\" Vega said. \"It just indicates to me that they don't want to see the results of the reconciliation bill,\" referring to the Republican's \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about that claim.",
      "New work requirements",
      "New work requirements for SNAP recipients are taking effect as the labor market stalls, raising the risk that more people could lose access to food stamps under the stricter rules mandated by the Republican law, advocates say.",
      "\"It's a tough workforce right now, and the work requirements come without any support,\" Gina Plata-Nino, a food stamp expert at the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our most vulnerable will have even less access to resources.\"",
      "The new work rules expand what the federal government considers so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, who are adults without young children who must prove they are either working, volunteering or engaged in an education or training program for at least 20 hours a week to qualify for food stamps.",
      "Previously, the work requirements only applied to people between 18 to 54 years old, but the new law pushes that to age 64. Additionally, people who are former foster youth between 18 to 24 years old, veterans or homeless are no longer exempt from the work requirements, as they were previously.",
      "People who don't meet the work requirements will be limited to receiving food stamps for three months within a three-year period.",
      "\"Just off the bat, those are veterans, youths aging out of foster care \u2014 think about what it means to be unhoused, trying to get a job when you don't have a place to shower,\" Plata-Nino said. \"Again, these populations are going to be worse off.\"",
      "Work requirements have been championed by Republican lawmakers because they say the rules encourage people to be gainfully employed or engaged in the community in exchange for food aid.",
      "But anti-hunger advocates argue the rules often bump people off the program because they may face difficulties in filing paperwork. Others point out that low-income workers may struggle to get enough hours from their employers to meet the new federal requirements, especially given the proliferation of \"just in time\" scheduling, which slots workers into short shifts to reduce costs for employers.",
      "Prior to the changes, most SNAP recipients who were required to work were doing so, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Stricter aid calculations",
      "Under the new GOP tax and spending law, there are other changes going into the SNAP program that could reduce benefits for millions.",
      "For instance, SNAP applicants can deduct their utility costs from their incomes when calculating their benefits, which can help to increase their food-stamp allotments. But the new law now prevents food-stamp recipients from counting internet expenses as part of their household costs when determining benefits. That change went into effect as soon as the law was signed on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "\"Roughly 65% of participating households will see their benefit drop by an average of $10 a month\" because of the exclusion in using internet costs to calculate benefits, Vega said.",
      "\"It's a relatively small amount but for a household facing rising grocery cost and facing tough decisions, $10 can make a difference,\" she added.",
      "Longer-term, there are additional changes that could strain states' ability to provide food stamps, such as a shift in fiscal year 2027 requiring that states cover 75% of administrative costs, up from 50% now. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, states with high error rates \u2014 such as over- and underpayments of SNAP benefits \u2014 will also need to provide more funding for the program, starting in 2028.",
      "One concern, according to Vega, is whether states will have the financial resources to cover those additional costs.",
      "\"It's uncharted territory,\" she said. \"We do worry some states might decide they can't take that level of liability and won't participate in SNAP.\"",

    "summary": "Americans will pay 7.6% more to heat their homes this winter, study finds.",
    "story": [
      "Americans will dish out more money to heat their homes this winter as electricity and natural gas costs continue to soar.",
      "That's according to a new study from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) which predicts that\u00a0Americans will see their energy bill rise 7.6% to $976 on average this cold weather season. Those who rely on natural gas to heat their home could see an 8.4% jump in their bill, while those who use electricity could see a 10.2% increase.",
      "While electricity\u00a0prices vary\u00a0by state, overall the cost is rising. In August, prices increased by 6.2% compared with the same month last year, according to the latest inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Those costs will continue to escalate as much as 18% in the next few years, according to a May\u00a0report\u00a0from The U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Natural gas prices are up 13.8% from last year, far outpacing the rate of inflation, which rose 2.9% in August on an annual basis.",
      "Not all Americans will see an increase in their winter energy bills. Heating oil and propane users \u2014 roughly only 10% of U.S. households \u2014 could see their energy bills decrease by 4% and 5% respectively.",
      "The overall rising home-heating costs follow greater summer air-conditioning use, amid warmer temperatures. \"The average summer household electricity bill reached an estimated $776 in 2025, the highest in at least 12 years compounding household strain,\" the report states.",
      "\"We had a period of relatively stable electric bills and then last year electricity went up twice the rate of inflation,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As a result, more American households are falling behind on their energy bills.",
      "Since Dec. 31, 2023, energy arrearages \u2014 unpaid energy bills that homeowners owe to their utility company \u2014 have risen by about 31%, from approximately $17.5 billion to $23.0 billion by June 30, 2025, NEADA said in its report.",
      "The surge in energy arrearages comes as Americans are carrying\u00a0record amounts of debt. With inflation continuing to ramp up the cost of daily living, ahead of wages, total household debt reached $18.39 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, with unpaid credit card balances exceeding $1.21 trillion.",
      "Why are energy prices rising?",
      "The main factors driving up energy prices is the ongoing high cost of maintaining and upgrading the grid, along with rising natural gas prices and increasing electricity demand from data centers according to the NEADA report.",
      "\"As demand goes up and supply is not matching that, prices are going to go up,\" Abe Scarr, director of the Energy and Utilities Program at the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), told CBS MoneyWatch",
      "Russia's invasion of Ukraine also\u00a0created volatility\u00a0in energy prices, government data shows.",
      "So far this year, approximately 60 utility companies have either increased electricity and gas prices or proposed further increases,\u00a0according to the Center for American Progress, a Washington D.C.-based think tank. With more rate hikes on the horizon, American households will have to try to stretch their income even further.",
      "\"Families just finished paying their high electric bills for the summer, and now they're looking at high bills for the winter,\" Wolfe said.",
      "How to lower your utility bills",
      "As winter approaches, what can Americans do to lower their utility bill?",
      "Scarr suggests that people check with their utility companies, which often offer incentive programs to help customers implement cost-saving measures. Offerings vary by utility, but many companies provide free home energy assessments and discounts for people who want to insulate their homes.",
      "For those interested in fortifying the envelope of their home to minimize heat loss, options include hiring a contractor for a professional retrofit or, for straightforward insulation projects, DIY tips, he said.",
      "When it comes to general energy conservation, experts suggest unplugging small appliances or electronics when you're not using them. While it might seem obvious, people can also turn down the temperature in the home a few degrees to save money, said Scarr.",

      "\"Oregon communities are stable, and our local officials have been clear: we have the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference,\" Rayfield in a statement.",
      "\"Sending in 200 National Guard troops to guard a single building is not normal. If you had a concern about safety at your own home, you'd make a few calls and fill the gaps \u2014 not call in an army. What we're seeing is not about public safety, it's about the President flexing political muscle under the guise of law and order, chasing a media hit at the expense of our community.\"",

      "Local officials, including Gov. Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, have pushed back on Mr. Trump's comments and plans to send troops to the city.",

      "She said that there have been some demonstrations near a federal facility, but Portland police and federal officials there are capable of handling the situation.",
      "\"And when people cross the line ... there's unlawful activity, people are being held accountable,\" Kotek said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a Portland Police spokesperson said there have been \"an almost constant protest down at the ICE facility in South Portland,\" but did not comment on any arrests.",
      "\"The protest numbers have waxed and waned over time. Last night there were some people down there, and there are more tonight,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The governor called the deployment of troops unlawful and said that it will make residents less safe.",
      "Kotek also said she has been in conversations with California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who's also dealing with the presence of federal agents in Chicago.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Sunday that a government shutdown is likely unless top Democrats back down from their negotiating position.",
      "\"I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview with CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump also expressed confidence that the American people will side with him if government funding expires in the coming days, and he believes Democrats will pay a political price for not working with him, on his terms, to further cut spending.",
      "\"They're not interested in fraud, waste and abuse,\" Mr. Trump said of the Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump will meet Monday with congressional leaders ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline for lawmakers to reach an agreement on a spending bill that would avert a shutdown.",
      "A source close to Mr. Trump told CBS News that the president privately welcomes the prospect of a shutdown because it will enable him to wield executive power to slash some government programs and salaries.",
      "Last week, the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies telling them to prepare layoff plans if there is a government shutdown.",
      "The memo, obtained by CBS News, tells agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices \u2014 a federal term for layoffs \u2014 for employees in programs, projects or activities that have discretionary funding that stops on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. It also goes further and says that employees should get RIF notices if they're in programs or projects \"not consistent with the President's priorities.\"",
      "In the interview Sunday, Mr. Trump cast the Democrats' current demands \u2014\u00a0 which in recent weeks have focused on seeking to extend Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies \u2014\u00a0 as ill-advised.",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump said, if the Democrats want to discuss health care, they should work with him to prevent undocumented migrants from accessing public benefits.",
      "\"The Democrats, incredibly, want to keep their old policies of open borders and we're not going to have it. We're not going to allow it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Any possible health-care negotiations, Mr. Trump added, must address immigration and border-related matters, otherwise, \"It's just not acceptable for us.\"",
      "Democrats have forcefully pushed back against Mr. Trump's characterization of their positions on both government funding and on immigration. And they have repeatedly noted that people who are in the U.S. illegally are not eligible to receive Medicaid coverage.",
      "\"Donald Trump knows, or at least I think he knows, that current federal law prohibits using taxpayer dollars for undocumented immigrants in connection with their health care. And no one is trying to change or reverse that law,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told MSNBC on Saturday. \"What we are doing is fighting to protect the healthcare of everyday Americans in the midst of this Republican-caused crisis that is devastating hospitals and nursing homes and community-based health clinics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet Monday with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Jeffries.",
      "The meeting comes after the president canceled an initial meeting last week, citing the Democrats' \"unserious and ridiculous\" demands.",

But Democrats put forward their own proposal that would keep the government funded until Oct. 31, along with implementing other priorities for the party, including their health-care request. In the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to advance most legislation, both the bill passed by the House House-passed bill to fund the government and the Democrats' proposal fell short.",
      "The Democrats' proposal included a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which Democrats have suggested is a red line for their support. The proposal would also roll back cuts to Medicaid in Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",
      "The Senate is returning to Washington on Monday after a weeklong recess, and will have little time to act to avert a shutdown. Echoing Mr. Trump, Thune told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that it's \"totally up to the Democrats\" whether the government shuts down, saying \"there is a bill sitting at the desk in the Senate right now\" that the House passed that would keep the government open.",

    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's redistricting push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "Missouri has joined Texas and California in redrawing its congressional maps, as part of a redistricting push that could lead to Republicans drawing themselves as many as six extra House seats while Democrats' efforts could help them pick up five.",
      "The redistricting gambit began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the state's districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats.",
      "Then, in Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map earlier this month to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, signed the legislation on Sunday.",
      "Challenges remain for the maps in all three states. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create the new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Civil rights groups are also suing in Texas, claiming the maps are racially biased. And in California, the state's new map must be approved by voters in a November special election before it takes effect.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, includingIndiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's\u00a0 district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",

      "\"That's right, as it now turns out, FBI Agents were at, and in, the January 6th Protest, probably acting as Agitators and Insurrectionists, but certainly not as 'Law Enforcement Officials,'\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A report from the Office of the Inspector General released late last year outlined that its review found no evidence \"showing or suggesting that the FBI had undercover employees in the various protest crowds, or at the Capitol\" on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel, who was nominated by Mr. Trump in January after Wray resigned, clarified in a post on X on Saturday that \"274 FBI agents were thrown into crowd control on Jan. 6,\" adding that the move went against FBI standards. Patel said that \"failure was on corrupt leadership,\" while thanking agents for \"stepping up,\" saying \"the truth is coming out.\"",
      "Klobuchar, who led a bipartisan investigation into the Jan. 6 insurrection, said that across a number of hearings and recommendations for changes, \"nowhere was it found that the FBI was acting as agitators.\"",
      "\"In fact, they were called in when there was such a delay in bringing in the military to assist in what was essentially an insurrection where over 100 police officers were injured or maimed because of this criminal activity at the Capitol,\" she added.",
      "Klobuchar acknowledged Patel's clarification that the agents \"were brought in after the fact.\"",
      "\"Senators \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 were calling the military leaders,\" she said. \"They were calling the Attorney General, they were asking for help, because that help was not coming to the Capitol. And everyone has seen those facts.\"",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, said that when it comes to the reporting around the number of agents, \"this does seem to be significantly different than what anyone has heard before.\" He added that it \"certainly is concerning.\"",
      "\"As the FBI looks at the information, is it the same? Is it the same information that has been looked at before, or is it different?\" Turner said. \"And that certainly bears a review, and that, I think, will occur.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. We have breaking news as we begin what is likely to be another turbulent week here in Washington. Congress faces a government shutdown deadline of October 1. Our Robert Costa spoke this morning to President Trump. Bob, top leaders, both parties, both sides of the Capitol, are coming to the White House. Did the President tell you he thinks a shutdown can be avoided?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: A shutdown looks likely at this point based on my conversation this morning with President Trump. He says both sides are at a stalemate. Democrats want to extend health care subsidies that were part of the Affordable Care Act, but President Trump said his focus on health care is on preventing undocumented migrants from having access to any of the U.S. health care system. Now, it's illegal for any non-citizen to have that sort of access, but President Trump says we're not going to have it. Quote, we're not going to allow it, in terms of moving forward on any discussion, unless the Democrats come to his side on health care and don't focus on the subsidies. But based on my conversations with top Democrats, that's not going to happen. So President Trump told me quote, I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue. That makes a shutdown quite likely. And inside the White House, sources are saying President Trump actually welcomes a shutdown in the sense that he believes he can wield executive power to get rid of what he calls waste, fraud and abuse. And there is that memo, as you mentioned, that says the government is ready to have mass firings if a deal isn't struck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Reductions in force, right. Well, we also know that the President took some extraordinary public statements in the past few days. He publicly said he wants to see Adam Schiff, now a senator, Letitia James prosecuted along with James Comey, the former FBI director who is now indicted. Yesterday, he twice posted on social media about former FBI Director Chris Wray. Did the President tell you, is he planning prosecutions?",
      "COSTA: I did not speak directly to the president about that today. But fishing around all weekend in his inner circle, it's clear, this is just the beginning in terms of possible prosecutions of those who have scrutinized the president or criticized him over the years. You mentioned the mortgage policy, potentially, of Senator Adam Schiff of California. He's being discussed inside of the Trump administration. So is Letitia James, the New York Attorney General, who sued the president over how he valued his real estate holdings. And there are others not even on our radar at this moment, like retired Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, who are being discussed as people who have, may have taken action against the administration or president in some way, allegedly, in the views of those inside. And they want to see the Justice Department hold them to account. There's such a gap right now in Washington. Republicans believe what President Trump is doing is accountability. Democrats are alarmed and see this as authoritarian government at work. And there's a real tension there that's not going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And a justice system that has to deal with evidence and facts.",
      "And we're going to talk about all of this ahead with some of our guests. Robert Costa, thank you very much for your reporting."

      "\"At the request of Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, I am directing Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists. I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.\"",

      "\"The Department will provide information and updates as they become available,\" Parnell said.",
      "No other information regarding the size or the timing of the deployment of troops has been released. CBS News has reached out to the U.S. Northern Command and the National Guard Bureau for more details.",
      "Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek told reporters at a news conference Saturday that she has spoken with Mr. Trump and Noem and said, \"Our city is a far cry from the war-ravaged community he has posted on social media and I conveyed that directly to him.\" She also said the president told her: \"Let's keep talking.\"",
      "\"There is no insurrection, there is no threat to national security and there is no need for military troops in our major city,\" Kotek said. \"Military service members should be dedicated to real emergencies.\"",

      "He deployed the National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his law enforcement takeover in the District of Columbia.",
      "The ICE facility in Portland has been the target of frequent demonstrations, sometimes leading to violent clashes. Some federal agents have been injured and several protesters have been charged with assault.

      "On Saturday, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson responded to Mr. Trump, saying that the \"number of necessary troops is zero, in Portland and any other American city.\"",
      "\"Our nation has a long memory for acts of oppression, and the president will not find lawlessness or violence here unless he plans to perpetrate it. Imagine if the federal government sent hundreds of engineers, or teachers, or outreach workers to Portland, instead of a short, expensive, and fruitless show of force,\" Wilson said.",
      "Both Democratic senators representing Oregon on Saturday criticized the president's plans as \"authoritarian,\" saying Portland is a peaceful city.",
      "\"Trump is sending troops to Portland with the goal of 'doing a number' on the city. We know what this means. He wants to stoke fear and chaos and trigger violent interactions and riots to justify expanded authoritarian control,\" Sen.

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Ty Cobb, who served as White House Special Counsel during President Trump's first term, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Ty Cobb. He served as White House Special Counsel for just under a year during the first Trump administration, helping to coordinate the response to Robert Mueller's probe of Russian influence on the 2016 election. Good morning to you.",
      "FORMER WHITE HOUSE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT TY COBB: Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw this action against former FBI Director James Comey this past week, and he was indicted on two charges specific to his September 2020 testimony to Congress about Russian election meddling in 2016, so-called Crossfire Hurricane. In your view, from what you've heard of this case, do you think it has enough substance to actually head to trial?",
      "COBB: I don't, really. You know, as you and Senator Kaine discussed briefly, moments ago, that the grand jury rejected one of the counts, the top count, actually, in the indictment, approved two, but by a very slim margin, 14 out of 23 in a process where there's no defense attorney in the room, and the standard is merely probable cause. The next courtroom that this will be assessed in, if it gets to trial, requires unanimity from 12 people, and there will be a vigorous defense. I don't see any way in the world that, you know, Comey will be convicted. And I think there's a good chance, because of, you know, the wholly unconstitutional, authoritarian way that this was done, that the case may get tossed out well before trial.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wholly unconstitutional and authoritarian. That's- that's quite a description. You used to work for President Trump. What makes you now characterized his actions that way?",
      "COBB: I used to work- well, I used to work at the White House as as a lawyer, you know, interacting with the Justice Department in the Mueller investigation and other matters, and I was not Trump's personal lawyer. So, my role was really, you know, as a- as a government employee, and not personal to the- to the president. He did have personal lawyers, but, you know, at the time, you know, I was trying to perform the duties that were assigned to me. In this- in this circumstance, you know, I'm eight years removed from that. I don't- I don't have any allegiances or reasons to, you know, say anything other than balls and strikes. And former Attorney General Jackson, Justice Jackson, Nuremberg Prosecutor, himself, highlighted in 1940 that the most important thing at the Justice Department when he was Attorney General was that people not target individuals, that they merely pursue crimes. Griffin Bell, years later, 1978 said essentially the same thing. Emphasized how political- politics and favor have no business at the Justice Department. It's all about even-handedness. And I think we talked about the misrepresentations that Attorney General Bondi made about how she would proceed even-handedly, and, you know, she's wholly abandoned that and is now merely doing the President's bidding when he says, prosecute my enemies, now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Well, the New York Times is reporting that half a dozen US Attorney's Offices have been ordered to draft plans to investigate a group funded by George Soros, who is a democratic donor. You look at that, you look at the list of names of others who the President has said he specifically wants to be prosecuted or investigated. I'll read a few of them to you: Two former Trump officials, Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor. He also said he wants a federal investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith, the DOJ fired the 35 lawyers who were involved in the January 6th and classified documents cases. The Justice Department is now going after Fulton County DA Fani Willis' travel records. We have quite an exhaustive list here. What is the pattern you see?",
      "COBB: Well, I think if you go to 30,000 feet, what you see is a lot of moving parts, but simple themes. The simple themes are rewriting history. Trump wants to rewrite history so that, you know, the next generation may not know that he incited a violent insurrection, refused to peacefully transfer the power of the presidency after losing an election, stole classified documents and showed them to friends and- and guests at Mar-a-Lago, you know, and that he was a criminal. I mean, he's a convicted felon. All- all anybody involved in those events that offended him, they're- they're in real danger. So, you have the rewriting history stuff. You know, the US attorney that he appointed, his personal lawyer, Lindsay Halligan. You know her, her role previously in the administration was, you know, trying to eliminate the theory that, you know, America had slaves at the Smithsonian. She was there to, you know, whitewash the- the Smithsonian and paint America- paint America is something that- that it isn't. I mean, America needs to learn from the mistakes and lessons that we've had, and one of the biggest mistakes that- that America ever had was re-electing President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a number of Republican lawmakers are declining to speak out and are leaving the door open that these cases are legitimate. Do you think that the judicial system can resist what you are saying here as just simply politically motivated pressure?",
      "COBB: I think that's an excellent question. I think, you know, the founders, when they- when they drafted the Constitution, Article One is to Congress, and Congress has the greatest powers under the Constitution; spending power, war power, impeachment. Congress is really there to check the presidency. Congress has been neutered by the cowardice of the Republicans. Mike Johnson won't even seat recently elected representative Grijalva because he doesn't want her to tip the balance on the- on the Epstein vote. Congress is totally in the tank and --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, I'm gonna have to cut you off. I'm sorry, because we're out of time there. Ty Cobb, thank you for your time. We'll be right back."

      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thanks. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about Ukraine, which you just returned from, but before I do that, let's button up where we left the conversation with Senator Klobuchar. FBI Director Chris Wray was twice spoken about in public statements by the President yesterday, and he said he has some explaining to do. He seemed to be connecting it to the FBI and January 6th. Are you at all concerned by the former director's actions?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I do think that there- you know, with this new information, there's going to have to be some explaining as to what 6th- what is this new information, and how does this relate to January?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, the number of the agents? That 274 --",
      "REP. TURNER: Yes. This does seem to be significantly different than what anyone has heard before, and how does this relate to the circumstances of what occurred there. Certainly, Kash Patel, as he's bringing this forward, this is going to be information that I think does relate. It really does go to everyone's confidence of what we currently know about that day. There's been a number of investigations, and a number of people who've looked at this. You know, this certainly is concerning. And I think you know it is better --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what part is concerning, because that inspector general report said months ago that there were several 100 FBI agents who responded after the Capitol Police asked him to be there?",
      "REP. TURNER: But it's the issue of, you know, what was- what- what was their role? What did they do? You know, that aspect, I think certainly. As we look at this information, as the FBI looks at the information, is it the same? Is it the same information that has been looked at before, or is it different? And that certainly bears review, and that, I think, will occur.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when the President says Chris Wray has some explaining to do, how do you interpret that? Because the Inspector General report is public. Kash Patel said those individuals were there. It's not standard to send them, but it was disclosed they were there at the Capitol.",
      "REP. TURNER: I mean, obviously, the current FBI Director, and the FBI is going to have to come forward with the information. That information will be reviewed, and then, ultimately, the FBI is going to have to- and I think that the prior director will have to explain how this information relates to what we've looked at before. And it's either going to be the same and prove that it is as everyone believed the circumstances were before, or it's going to be different. And, at that point, we're going to have to look at, you know, how does it relate to what we believe we knew, and how does it relate to what we now see, what we don't know. Because I have no information, I think no one else has any additional information besides what the news reports are, and we'll have to review what that information is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to be very clear, because it is such a dangerous information environment in so many ways, you are not in any way suggesting that the FBI was secretly agitating, which is what the president said the attack on January 6th?",
      "REP. TURNER: I'm not suggesting anything, and I don't think you are either. I think what we're both suggesting is that this currently is in news reports, and those news reports certainly bear a review of the information that's going to come forward, and that information is either going to tell us that it's the same information that has been seen before, or it's going to be new information. And if it's new information that's going to need to be reviewed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, and I want to talk about your trip to Ukraine on the other side of it, but I have to do this right now. So stay with us, all of you.",
      "((COMMERCIAL BREAK))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return now to our conversation with Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Congressman, we were showing video there earlier of the overnight attack Russia carried out against Ukraine. You were just there, in Kyiv. I'm sure you welcomed what the President said this week, when he said he now has changed his mind, and he does believe Ukraine could win this war and get its territory back from Russia. But he also added he wishes everyone well when he made that statement. So is he telling us that the United States is walking away from Ukraine and leaving it up to them, or is he signaling that the United States is going to help Ukraine win that territory back?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, we definitely need to help. And this is part of the dirty secret that really where the United States really needs to step it up, and it's part of the meeting that he had with the president of the EU Commission. You know, the United States is providing aid to Ukraine. But, at the same time, the West, the EU, and the United States is subsidizing Russia and its production machine, because, you know, we're buying from China and India that is buying energy from Russia, and the EU is buying energy from Russia. So we need to place sanctions on Russia so that we're not funding their economy, which is funding their ability to attack and kill Ukraine. So we're funding both sides of this. Unfortunate- unfortunately, there are those in Congress that want to stop supporting Ukraine's ability to defend themselves. Well, that'll just result in more attacks from Russia, as we saw last night, against Ukraine. That's not going to get us to peace. The only way to get us to peace, and Trump's vision of peace, is to impact their ability for production, to stop subsidizing Russia's economy and their ability for production and killing Ukrainians, and that's to adopt Lindsey Graham and Brian Fitzpatrick's bill that would impose sanctions. Give the President the ability to impact Russia's ability to wage this war and get us to peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Speaker Johnson has said before that he would put that bill to a vote, he just hasn't. And he has said, oh, I need the president to green light it. That's not true. He has a veto-proof majority. We've had Senator Graham on this program a million times telling us this is set to go, just give us the green light. Did Speaker Johnson respond to your request to move?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, and he's- the momentum is here, we need to do this now. The President doesn't need to give us a green light. He's not a red light. The last time that- and we and we're coming back, and we need to do so, we need to do so now. The last time we put on the floor the bill that would have stopped funding Ukraine, over 300 members voted for it. If we put the bill on the floor to stop the- to put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their economy, it would be similar. Over 300 members would vote for it. The only way to peace is to put sanctions on Russia, continue our support for Ukraine, which is what we're doing, what the President is going to be doing, and bring this war to an end. Support Trump's vision of peace. Put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their- their war economy. Now, what I saw in Ukraine, which is what's really incredible, is that they are winning modern warfare. What they're doing with their anti-drone technology, I mean, they are really the tech bros of the future. They are implementing on the front line, anti-drone air defense technology that is winning this war with our help and assistance, which they're going to continue to need for the long-range systems that Russia is bringing in and that are attacking Kyiv with. But what their anti-drone technology that no one else has, that they are implementing. They are winning this war. We need to be on the side of that war of the future that they're winning and support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I've heard military officials explain this to me that this is like a really interesting test case to learn the lessons that Ukraine is illustrating for the world. However, in the immediate term, will the President lift restrictions on Ukraine's ability to use long-range weapons to actually attack Russia?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, and he really needs to do so, because what's happening with that pressure that's on the front line \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he has the old Biden policy.",
      "REP. TURNER: Right, well, he does, and that's what he needs to release, because with the pressure on the front line and the fact that Ukraine has developed anti-drone technology, where they're taking down Russian drones, they're using their own drones to attack Russia, but Russia has long-range weapons that they're attacking that front line. Ukraine needs to have the ability to use long-range weapons to push Russia back. And when they're able to do that, they will get their territory back. If they are able to do that, they will win this war. And if we put sanctions on Russia, impacting their ability to produce their war machine and production, they will be able to win this modern warfare, and will be on the right side of what- this is not old-time war. This is modern war, and we're being on the right side of Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've just got to persuade President Trump to do that- that change in policy. When we were in France last week speaking to President Macron, I asked him about those incursions into European airspace, some would say by Russian drones or Russian jets, others have said they still need to investigate. We've seen drones or jets into Poland, Estonia, Romania, Norway, possibly Denmark. What should the United States be doing to push back on those provocations?",
      "REP. TURNER: You know, what's interesting about this is it? What we've always said is that, you know, Russia, once they got through Ukraine, would be testing and go- can continue into Europe. But what they're seeing- but what they're seeing now, because they're having this- this success of Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine. They're now going into Poland and Romania, and they're seeing that Poland and Romania don't have the advanced technology that Ukraine does, and instead of going through Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine since- since this is Modern Warfare, and Ukraine is winning it, they're seeing that the old war is actually old Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike Turner, thank you for sharing some of your insights, what you learned on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "REP TURNER: Thank you,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back in a moment. So stay with us."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who joins us this morning from Richmond. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have what, 140,000 federal civilian workers in your state, one of the highest numbers in the nation. How concerned are you that you will see mass layoffs if we go into the shutdown that the White House says they are preparing for?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, and I think your reporter Robert Costa said they're even welcoming it. We are really worried about it, Margaret. When Ted Cruz forced a shutdown of the government in October 2013, it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And when Donald Trump forced a shutdown of the government in late 2018, early 2019 it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And this one would be the same. The only thing about the President's threat to fire more people is he's already doing it, and instead of threatening, he should just be meeting to negotiate. We came near shut down deadlines during the Biden administration, but we never shut government down because the President would sit down with congressional leaders of both parties and would find a path forward. And that's what we've been asking for since the Democrats put an alternate plan on the table on September 18, just sit down and talk with us, and finally, he has agreed to do that tomorrow. But if you're reporting, is to be believed, he's sort of going into it, setting reducing expectations improperly. He should be doing what presidents do and saying, we're going to find a deal to keep the government of the greatest nation on earth open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it enough of a deal to say, take the short term, seven week funding deal, and we'll continue to talk about these health care subsidies that Democrats say they are so concerned about. I mean, is it really worth the risk?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Here's, here's my thought about this, Margaret. And this is my personal view. We've got to solve this health care issue. And Republicans are saying the same thing. Mike Johnson has said it. Senator Cornyn has said it, Senator Hawley has said it. Senator Murkowski has said it. We're asking to fix a problem that even Republicans want to fix. I don't think we have to have every detail pinned down with all the Is dotted and Ts crossed in order to do a short term extension, but I do want to see that Republicans are saying, You're right. We can fix this, and here's the path to finding a fix. And the second thing we need, which is so reasonable, we're just asking, if we do a deal, please don't, Mr. President, sign the deal, and then immediately the next day start, starting to take away funds, rescinding agreements that you just made yesterday. A deal should be a deal, and we should all agree that Americans should not see their health care suffer, their premiums spike, and people lose insurance and providers close. We've already had providers in Virginia announce that they are closing their doors because of the bill that the Republicans passed in July, and this is happening all over the country. Let's just do what's right by our constituents and fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you another question specific to Virginia, and that is, what is going on inside the judicial system. Back in August, it was the US Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, Todd Gilbert, who suddenly resigned. Then earlier this month, the US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Eric Siebert resigned after failing to bring a case against New York's Attorney General, Letitia James. What is going on here in the Virginia court system? Margaret?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: It's pretty darn plain the President nominated two U.S. attorneys in Virginia, both with Republican bona fides. Todd Gilbert in the Western District, had been the Republican Speaker of our house of delegates. He resigned as a legislator to take the Trump appointment. President Trump's team interviewed these candidates, approved the candidates, nominated the candidates, and then even appointed them into the interim position. But both were forced out because they said their integrity as prosecutors would not allow them to genuflect to Donald Trump. And in Todd Gilbert's case, they wanted to force him to demote a long time career member of the Western District of Virginia who had served under multiple administrations and presidents. He refused to do so. And in Eric Siebert's case, he refused to bring a criminal charge against a perceived Trump political opponent when there was no evidence to support the charge. President Trump is spending time going after enemies, trying to figure out a way to give $20 billion to a friend, the Argentine Government, instead of dealing with the challenges we elected him to confront. Food prices are going up. Building supplies are going up. School supplies are going up. Energy costs are going up, health care costs are going up, and Donald Trump seems to be focused on a retribution campaign. You got to focus, man, this is an important job. It's time to focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to those Virginia cases, have you talked to Siebert, have you talked to Gilbert to understand why they felt they had to resign?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: I have talked to each of them after the resignations were done. These were individuals I knew both. I knew Todd Gilbert because of his legislative role, and I knew Eric Siebert very well by reputation. And again, this was the prosecutor Margaret, who, when the Biden administration transitioned to the Trump administration, the Trump administration DOJ put him in the role as an interim even before we recommended him, along with our republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, as you mentioned. So after they had been fired, yes, I did call and say I'd like to understand why you were forced out, and they shared thoughts with me without getting into anything about particular cases or particular communication they'd had with Trump administration officials. But I am convinced, and Virginians are convinced. I traveled around the state this week. People are talking about this. Both of these individuals had a backbone. They wouldn't genuflect to Donald Trump, and they wouldn't bring baseless cases, and we shouldn't see that in any district in this nation. And it's sad that President Trump is more focused on retribution than serving his constituents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that Eastern District did come forward with this, this indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. Yes, it was just a two page indictment, no evidence presented publicly here, but it was convincing enough to 14 of 23 people sitting on a grand jury. Can you really say there's no there there?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, a bare majority, as you know, Margaret, there's 23 people on a grand jury. They need at least 12 votes to get an indictment, and yes, they got their finger over the bar with 14, although the four- the 23 wouldn't agree on one of the charges that the US attorney was pushing. So we will see what this case is about. It is odd that the indictment has so few facts, and I found it very odd. I used to practice in this court, and when the Attorney General put out a press statement after the indictment and said, we will follow the facts in this case. What prosecutors follow the facts before they indict, they don't indict, and then say, well, let's see what the facts are. I think she even revealed that this is a weak case, which everyone in her office was telling her it was a weak case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You in your armed services role. I want to quickly ask you, you have said you are supportive of the creation of a Palestinian state, and we saw at the UN this past week, a large number of members just simply walked out when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke, it was a statement tomorrow he's going to be at the White House ahead of that meeting, President Trump said this:",
      "VO SOT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There's been enough. It's time to stop now, okay?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a strong statement. Do you know how the United States should enforce that? How do you force Israel to step back from annexation?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, I was very heartened that the President said that, and you're right. I support what the United States voted for in the UN in 1947 a state of Israel and a state of Palestine. One of those promises has been met. One hasn't, and we need to be on a path for a Palestinian state that's demilitarized, where Hamas plays no role in its governance. And until we find that path forward, we're going to have continued cycles of violence that are bad for Israelis, bad for Palestinians, bad for the region. So I hope the president, who, by all accounts, has a strong relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu, makes plain that we are, we are against annexation, and this 21 point proposal that the President has on the table, which is pretty similar to the New York dialog being led by the French and the Saudis. They're different efforts, but they're trying to reach the same point, a future state for Israel and Palestine, where both can live in peace, and creating stability in the region instead of the cycles of violence. So I hope the president leans into that at the meeting tomorrow. I was heartened by his comment. It would be a big mistake for the Prime Minister Netanyahu to look at all of these nations that have been allies, saying you need to change course, and for him to just pull his head in the shell and turn inward and continue to isolate Israel, rather than move forward toward peace and more stability in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Kaine, thank you for your insights today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. She is a member of Democratic leadership, and she joins us this morning from Minneapolis. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Thanks, Margaret, great to be on again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we just heard from my colleague, Robert Costa that the President indicated to him the likelihood of a shutdown, and with that, potentially mass firings. Do you think this is posturing, or do you worry your fellow Democrats are walking into a trap?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I am glad the president has finally agreed to meet with the leadership in Congress. He canceled the meeting last week, which I think was a big mistake, because this is an opportunity for the country because of one big problem. And that is that the Republicans have created a health care crisis. My constituents, Americans are standing on a cliff right now with these insurance premium increases that are upon them. So Democrats are united in pushing on this and saying, look, let us do something about this crisis before it is too late. Seventy five percent increase in premiums starting November 1, on people who are small business owners, people who are farmers out there, twice as much in the rural areas. So that's what this is about to us, and the President prides himself in the art of a deal, this is the moment for him to meet with Democrats and come to an agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So those premiums go up November 1. You're talking about the extension of the health care subsidies, but insurance companies plan that year out, so these premiums are already priced in here. Why not agree to--",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --Margaret, what we know is that these tax--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --government--",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --If I could just, okay, go ahead, the tax credits are what really could make a difference here for people, because of the fact that we know these premiums hit November 1. Getting this done now is a now thing. It's not a December thing. It's not a January thing. It's not an off ramp. It is something we have to get done now. As one of my farmers that I met with out in rural Minnesota said, when looking at the President's tariffs and looking at what's happened in farm country, five-year high in small farm bankruptcy, he said it's a perfect storm of ugly. That's where we are with the economy right now. And that's why we are pushing on what is one of the biggest cost drivers for Americans, in addition to groceries and electricity prices going up, it's health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, you couldn't take the seven week funding and then negotiate that, you're saying it has to be agreed to right now.",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: We believe this is a now problem, and while we are eager to talk with Senator Thune, I know Senator Schumer is to get this moving, in the end, we know that they are rubber stamped for what the President wants. Not everyone is like Rand Paul going off in his own direction and talking about the debt out of the \"Big, Beautiful Bill.\" I don't agree with a lot of what he says, but he's right about that debt. He's right about what happened with that bill, most of them are just going to rubber stamp what President Trump says. That's why it was so important to get this meeting, and I hope he sees it, not as the president, not as political theater, but as real people who are facing a crisis right now, whether it's in the cities, the suburbs or the rural areas of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sit on the Judiciary Committee. So I want to ask you about what's happening right now. Earlier this month, the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert resigned after failing to bring a case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. We just spoke about her with Robert Costa. Monday, Lindsey Halligan was sworn in as the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. She has never prosecuted a case before. Three days into this new job, she moved forward with the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on two counts. Have you spoken to your fellow Republicans on the Judiciary Committee? Do they have concerns about what's happening in Virginia?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Well, I plan on doing that this week. And what I see, this as a former prosecutor myself, this is weaponizing the Justice Department, basically taking a career prosecutor who was recommended by the Republican governor of the state of Virginia, clearly has Republican roots, who made a decision based on the evidence over a period of months, made a decision. Then he's pushed out, forced out, so that the President can install his own aid into the job. When I questioned Attorney General Bondi during her confirmation hearing, she assured me that politics would not play a role that they would make independent decisions. That is not what this is. This is a vengeance prosecution. It is not about the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You also worked on investigating January 6, 2021, and the attack of the United States Capitol. FBI director, Kash Patel. Yesterday said publicly 274 FBI agents were quote, \"thrown into crowd control on that day against FBI standards.\" President Trump also said publicly that FBI agents acted as agitators who were secretly placed against all rules, regulations, protocols and standards into the crowd prior to and during the attack. This contradicts what the Inspector General said in a published report that said there was no evidence of undercover employees in the crowd, and that there were hundreds of special agents and employees who came in after the Capitol Hill police asked for them. This is now newly in focus, because the President put the focus there, what was the role of the FBI that day?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I chaired the investigation of the security problems, along a bipartisan investigation with Senator Peters and then Senator Blunt and Senator Portman. This went on. We had a number of open hearings, and we made major, major recommendations for changes at the Capitol and nowhere was it found that the FBI was acting as agitators. In fact, they were called in when there was such a delay in bringing in the military to insist- to assist in what was essentially an insurrection, where over 100 police officers were injured or maimed because of this criminal activity at the Capitol. So I just find it appalling that the President would say that the FBI was somehow part of this. Kash Patel did clarify that in fact, they were brought in after the fact, but they were brought in because we needed help. Senators, Republicans and Democrats were calling the military leaders. They were calling the Attorney General. They were asking for help because that help was not coming to the Capitol. And everyone has seen those facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your insight there. We'll be watching what happens here, as the President tweeted both of those things, and in reference to former director Chris Wray, we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us."

      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to start on that news you just heard, that the President is basically expecting a shutdown and possibly to carry out these mass layoffs. Do you think all of this is just a threat to make Democrats fold?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, I think both sides have to look at the proposals for spending and decide, you know, what is the best way forward for the country. The Republican proposal adds about $2 trillion in debt over the next year, so it'll be short $2 trillion. So I oppose the Republican plan because it adds debt. The Democrat plan would add $3 trillion in debt. So really, both plans are laden with deficit spending, and I think that's the biggest problem that our country faces. So I've actually proposed an alternative. I proposed a penny plan, which would cut a little bit across the board, and my plan would balance over about five years, we got a vote on mine last week, and 36 Republicans supported it, 16 didn't and no Democrats did. So my plan didn't pass either, but the plan that I would support would be a plan that reduces spending and reduces deficit spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we have this immediate deadline, though, of this week, and we know leaders are going to the White House. If we end up in this shutdown. Do you think it is appropriate and illegal for the executive to carry out the kind of mass firings that the budget director laid out in that memo this past week?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, there's been several cases adjudicated now all the way to the Supreme Court, and the President seems to have won every one of them on his ability to hire and fire within the executive branch. And I think this is understandable, because in the executive branch if the president can't fire him, who can? and so I think the President has a great out",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Without consulting congress?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Over executive branch employees- for hiring and firing people in the executive branch? I think he has a great deal of leeway. The court has upheld this repeatedly, and so I suspect they will, even when Congress- you know, the Democrats try to protect this agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Board, and they say, well, the funding will come from the Fed. You won't get to vote on the funding, and the person hired can't be fired. Well, he did fire that person in 2020 and the courts upheld that in 2021, in the Supreme Court, and really since then, every case he has won. And as you know, I'm a equal parts critic of both Republicans and Democrats. I've criticized Trump on things, but the one thing is on the hiring and firing. I think he's going to win every one of those cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your role in Homeland Security. You are chairman of that oversight committee. The President announced yesterday, and I'm sure you saw his social media post, that he's going to send troops to Portland, Oregon. He called it a 'war ravaged' city. He said he's also going to send troops to any immigration facilities around the country which are, quote, 'under siege from attack by antifa, and other domestic terrorists.' End quote. He said he's authorizing full force if necessary. Do you know what full force means here? Do you know what's in store?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think he has the legal authority to send troops to protect federal buildings and federal proceedings such as courts, and that's been around since Civil Rights Era. We've acknowledged that the federal government will sometimes come in despite what states say. I do think it's better when the states agree to it. For example, I mean, in Chicago- Chicago is a nightmare. It is literally a war zone, and the people being hurt, the worst are those who are poor and living in these communities. I've been to the most dangerous precinct in Chicago, and it's just despair and sadness and these young boys are growing up with no families\u2013",
      "[CROSSTALK STARTS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you haven't been briefed on the plans for Oregon?",
      "SEN. PAUL: There's no restaurants, no drugs- excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you haven't been briefed on plans to send troops to Oregon?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Not for Portland, no.",
      "[CROSSTALK ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because we have not yet seen troops in Chicago, though you're referencing the President's past threats to do so. In Oregon, the governor said there's no need, and they don't want these troops, but the mayor said- the mayor of Portland, federal agents have been arriving along with some armored vehicles. Are you comfortable with pushing the limits here of some of these uses of either potentially troops or federal agents.",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think both the people in Portland and across America have to decide about this. You know, we had anarchy in Portland for like, six months or a year. The city didn't even control large swaths of the city. These had federal buildings on them, and so I think there is a role for the federal government. Am I excited about it? No. I'd prefer not to have troops in our cities, or I'd prefer them only to come, you know, with the acceptance of the local authorities. But I do think there is a role if the states will not step up. Portland did not step up, and they let their city go, you know, they let it burn for goodness sakes, and then they let a whole area become the city, you know, these blocks of anarchy where some sort of local thug rule was a- was- was going on. So I don't know, I think ultimately what's going to happen. And I think some of this is the President showing the politics of Republicans versus Democrats is eventually cities like Chicago and Portland are going to give up on Democrats because their people are dying. It's their people in their community. The people have been supporting the Democrat party for decade after decade. They are the ones dying. It's not the people in the rich neighborhoods that are country club Republican, it's the poor people in every city is dying. Well, you know the cities have to step up on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm asking about your oversight role, because it seemed like the President's statement yesterday, it took a turn. It wasn't how he talked about Chicago. In fact, when he was speaking in this social media post about Portland, he used language here about domestic terrorists. And we know just a few days ago, the President did issue that executive order saying he wanted to declare this anti fascist group, antifa, to be a domestic terrorist organization. Have you seen evidence that these left wing activists are now becoming a more organized group with national leadership, something the FBI has said in the past, that they're really more of an ideology?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think you lose the description as activists once you start wielding weapons, and you show up with helmets and you're breaking windows. That's what was going on apparently in Portland, at the ICE building. I do think, though, that it's important when people start talking about labeling people, that we realize everybody, the worst among us, even those accused of heinous crimes, will get due process. So we can't single out a group and say, oh, they're not going to get due process because we're calling them terrorists. So I'd be careful of the labels, but I'm absolutely for going after the people wielding clubs and sticks and fighting with the police and trying to get into the federal buildings. They have to be punished, and they will be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you have concerns about designating groups with these anti-government sentiments as domestic terrorist groups. I mean, do you start worrying about Fourth Amendment violations?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I don't know that it's helpful to label groups, particularly since antifa, there are some real people in antifa, they're real violent people, but it is an amorphous group in the sense that I don't think they have a president, they don't have a local chapter. It is more an ideology. And it was useful, maybe around the world, to call things terrorism. But there's different rules of engagement. When we have to go after terrorist in the Middle East, we send- we send a Hellfire missile or a drone, often. In the United States, it's much tricker to be a police. I have a great deal of respect for our police because you're right. They have to respect the Fourth Amendment, the First Amendment, and so we have to be careful with labels, but that doesn't mean we should go soft on antifa and these people that are committing violence.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump says another blue city needs federal protection. Plus, his opponents say he's stepping up a campaign of political retribution.",
      "President Trump now says that Portland, Oregon, is under siege and that he's sending troops there to protect ICE. But will his solution cause new problems?",
      "Back in Washington, Mr. Trump put his political opponents on notice after directing his Justice Department to indict former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): It's not a list, but I think there will be others. I mean, they're corrupt.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what can stop him from pursuing more cases?",
      "We will talk with the head of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Rand Paul.",
      "Plus, as the clock ticks down again towards a possible government shutdown, this round of the Washington blame game has the potential to hurt more than just the two parties. This time, the Trump administration is threatening to fire, instead of furlough, some federal workers, unless Democrats support their funding bill.",
      "Why won't they? We will ask two key Democrats in the Senate, Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar and Virginia's Tim Kaine.",
      "Overnight, Russia launches a massive attack involving hundreds of drones and missiles on Ukraine's capital city. Republican Congressman Mike Turner just returned from the region, and he will join us.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We have breaking news as we begin what is likely to be another turbulent week here in Washington. Congress faces a government shutdown deadline of October 1.",
      "Our Robert Costa spoke this morning to President Trump.",
      "Bob, top leaders, both parties, both sides of the Capitol, are coming to the White House. Did the president tell you he thinks a shutdown can be avoided?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: A shutdown looks likely at this point, based on my conversation this morning with President Trump.",
      "He says both sides are at a stalemate. Democrats want to extend health care subsidies that were part of the Affordable Care Act. But President Trump said his focus on health care is on preventing undocumented migrants from having access to any of the U.S. health care system.",
      "Now, it's illegal for any noncitizen to have that sort of access. But President Trump says, we're not going to have it \u2013 quote \u2013 \"We're not going to allow it\" in terms of moving forward on any discussion unless the Democrats come to his side on health care and don't focus on the subsidies.",
      "But, based on my conversations with top Democrats, that's not going to happen. So President Trump told me \u2013 quote \u2013 \"I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue.\"",
      "That makes a shutdown quite likely. And inside the White House, sources are saying President Trump actually welcomes a shutdown, in the sense that he believes he can wield executive power to get rid of what he calls waste, fraud, and abuse. And there is that memo, as you mentioned, that says the government is ready to have mass firings if a deal isn't struck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Reductions in force, right.",
      "Well, we also know that the president took some extraordinary public statements in the past few days. He publicly said he wants to see Adam Schiff, now a senator, Letitia James prosecuted, along with James Comey, the former FBI director, who is now indicted.",
      "Yesterday, he twice posted on social media about former FBI Director Chris Wray. Did the president tell you, is he planning prosecutions?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: I did not speak directly to the president about that today.",
      "But fishing around all weekend in his inner circle, it's clear this is just the beginning in terms of possible prosecutions of those who have scrutinized the president or criticized him over the years. You mentioned the mortgage policy potentially of Senator Adam Schiff of California. He's being discussed inside of the Trump administration.",
      "So is Letitia James, the New York attorney general, who sued the president over how he valued his real estate holdings. And there are others not even on our radar at this moment, like retired Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, who are being discussed as people who may have taken action against the administration or president in some way, allegedly, in the views of those inside, and they want to see the Justice Department hold them to account.",
      "There's such a gap right now in Washington. Republicans believe what President Trump is doing is accountability. Democrats are alarmed and see this as authoritarian government at work. And there's a real tension there that's not going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, and a justice system that has to deal with evidence and facts. And we're going to talk about all of this ahead with some of our guests.",
      "Robert Costa, thank you very much for your reporting.",
      "We want to go now to the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to start on that news you just heard that the president is basically expecting a shutdown and possibly to carry out these mass layoffs. Do you think all of this is just a threat to make Democrats fold?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, I think both sides have to look at the proposals for spending and decide, what is the best way forward for the country?",
      "The Republican proposal adds about $2 trillion in debt over the next year, so it'll be short $2 trillion. So, I oppose the Republican plan because it adds debt. The Democrat plan would add $3 trillion in debt. So, really, both plans are laden with deficit spending, and I think that's the biggest problem that our country faces.",
      "So I have actually proposed an alternative. I have proposed a penny plan, which would cut a little bit across the board, and my plan would balance over about five years. We got a vote on mine last week, and 36 Republicans supported it, 16 didn't, and no Democrats did. So my plan didn't pass either.",
      "But the plan that I would support would be a plan that reduces spending and reduces deficit spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we have this immediate deadline, though, of this week, and we know leaders are going to the White House.",
      "If we end up in this shutdown, do you think it is appropriate and legal for the executive to carry out the kind of mass firings that the budget director laid out in that memo this past week?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, there's been several cases adjudicated now all the way up to the Supreme Court, and the president seems to have won every one of them, on his ability to hire and fire within the executive branch.",
      "And I think this is understandable, because, in the executive branch, if the president can't fire them, who can? And so I think the president has a great deal of leeway over executive branch employees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Without consulting Congress?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: For hiring and firing people in the executive branch, I think he has a great deal of leeway. The court has upheld this repeatedly. And so I suspect they will.",
      "Even when Congress \u2013 the Democrats tried to protect this agency called the Consumer Financial Protection board. And they say, well, the funding will come from the Fed, you won't get to vote on the funding and the person hired can't be fired. Well, he did fire that person in 2020.",
      "And the courts upheld that in 2021 in the Supreme Court. And really, since then, every case, he has won. And, as you know, I'm equal parts critic of both Republicans and Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I have criticized Trump on things.",
      "But the one thing is on the hiring and firing. And I think he's going to win every one of those cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your role in Homeland Security. You are chairman of that oversight committee.",
      "The president announced yesterday, and I'm sure you saw his social media post, that he's going to send troops to Portland, Oregon. He called it a war-ravaged city. He said he's also going to send troops to any immigration facilities around the country which are \u2013 quote \u2013 \"under siege from attack by Antifa and other domestic terrorists\" \u2013 end quote.",
      "He said he's authorizing full force, if necessary. Do you know what full force means here? Do you know what's in store?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think he has the legal authority to send troops to protect federal buildings and federal proceedings, such as courts. And that's been around since the civil rights era. We have acknowledged that the federal government will sometimes come in, despite what states say.",
      "I do think it's better when the states agree to it, for example, I mean, in Chicago. Chicago is a nightmare. It is literally a war zone. And the people being hurt the worst are those who are poor and living in these communities. I have been to the most dangerous precinct in Chicago, and it's just despair and sadness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, but then \u2013 but you haven't been briefed on the plan for Oregon?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And these young boys have grown up with no families. There's no restaurants, no drugs.",
      "Excuse me? Say again, please.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have not been briefed on plans to send troops to Oregon?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Not for Portland, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because we have not yet seen troops in Chicago, though you're referencing the president's past threats to do so.",
      "In Oregon, the governor said there's no need and they don't want these troops. But the mayor said, the mayor of Portland, federal agents have been arriving, along with some armored vehicles. Are you comfortable with pushing the limits here of some of these uses of either potentially troops or federal agents?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think both the people in Portland and across America have to decide about this.",
      "We had anarchy in Portland for like six months or a year. The city didn't even control large swathes of the city. These had federal buildings on them. And so I think there is a role for the federal government. Am I excited about it? No, I'd prefer not to have troops in our cities, or I'd prefer them only to come with the acceptance of the local authorities.",
      "But I do think there is a role if the states will not step up. Portland did not step up, and they let their city go. They let it burn, for goodness' sakes. And then they let a whole area become the city \u2013 these blocks of anarchy, where some sort of local thug rule was going on.",
      "So, I don't know. I think, ultimately, what's going to happen \u2013 and I think some of this is the president showing the politics of Republicans versus Democrats \u2013 is, eventually, cities like Chicago and Portland are going to give up on Democrats, because their people are dying.",
      "It's their people in their community. The people who've been supporting the Democrat Party for decade after decade, they are the ones dying.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It's not the people in the rich neighborhoods or the country club Republican. It's poor people in every city who is dying, and the cities have to step up on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it sounded \u2013 well, I'm asking about your oversight role, because it seemed like the president's statement yesterday, it took a turn. It wasn't how he talked about Chicago.",
      "In fact, when he was speaking in this social media post about Portland, he used language here about domestic terrorists. And we know, just a few days ago, the president did issue that executive order saying he wanted to declare this anti-fascist group Antifa to be a domestic terrorist organization.",
      "Have you seen evidence that these left-wing activists are now becoming a more organized group with national leadership, something the FBI has said in the past that they're really more of an ideology?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, I think you lose the description as activists once you start wielding weapons and you show up with helmets and you're breaking windows. That's what was going on apparently in Portland at the ICE building.",
      "I do think, though, that it's important, when people start talking about labeling people, that we realize everybody, the worst among us, even those accused of heinous crimes, will get due process. So we can't single out a group and say, oh, they're not going to get due process because we're calling them terrorists.",
      "So I'd be careful of the labels, but I'm absolutely for going after the people wielding clubs and sticks and fighting with the police and trying to get into the federal buildings. They have to be punished, and they will be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you have concerns, though, about designating groups with these anti-government sentiments as domestic terrorist groups? I mean, do you start worrying about Fourth Amendment violations?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't know that it's helpful to label groups, particularly since Antifa \u2013 there are some real people in Antifa. They're real, violent people.",
      "But it is an amorphous group\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 in the sense that I don't think they have a president. They don't have a local chapter. It is more an ideology.",
      "And it was useful maybe around the world to call things terrorism, but there's different rules of engagement. When we have to go after terrorists in the Middle East, we send a Hellfire missile or a drone often. In the United States, it's much trickier to be a police \u2013 I have a great deal of respect for our police.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Because you're right. They have to respect the Fourth Amendment, the First Amendment. And so we have to be careful with labels.",
      "But it doesn't mean we should go soft on Antifa\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 and these people that are committing violence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator Rand Paul, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. She is a member of Democratic leadership. And she joins us this morning from Minneapolis.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-Minnesota): Thanks, Margaret. Great to be on again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we just heard from my colleague Robert Costa that the president indicated to him the likelihood of a shutdown and, with that, potentially mass firings.",
      "Do you think this is posturing or do you worry your fellow Democrats are walking into a trap?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I am glad the president has finally agreed to meet with the leadership in Congress. He canceled the meeting last week, which I think was a big mistake, because this is an opportunity for the country because of one big problem.",
      "And that is that the Republicans have created a health care crisis. My constituents, Americans, are standing on a cliff right now with these insurance premium increases that are upon them. So, Democrats are united in pushing on this and saying, look, let us do something about this crisis before it is too late, 75 percent increase in premiums starting November 1 on people who are small business owners\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 people who are farmers out there, twice as much in the rural areas.",
      "So that's what this is about to us. And the president prides himself in the art of a deal. This is the moment for him to meet with Democrats and come to an agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So those premiums go up November 1. You're talking about the extension of the health care subsidies. But insurance companies plan that a year out. So these premiums are already priced in here.",
      "Why not agree to the government\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Margaret, what we know is that these tax \u2013 if I could, just\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: OK. Go ahead.",
      "The tax credits are what really could make a difference here for people. Because of the fact that we know these premiums hit November 1, getting this done now is a now thing. It's not a December thing. It's not a January thing. It's not an off-ramp. It is something we have to get done now.",
      "As one of my farmers that I met with out in rural Minnesota said, when looking at the president's tariffs and looking at what's happened in farm country, five-year high in small farm bankruptcy, he said it's a perfect storm of ugly. That's where we are with the economy right now. And that's why we are pushing on what is one of the biggest cost drivers for Americans\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 in addition to groceries and electricity prices going up. It's health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, you couldn't take the seven-week funding and then negotiate that? You're saying it has to be agreed to right now?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: We believe this is a now problem.",
      "And while we are eager to talk with Senator Thune, I know Senator Schumer is, to get this moving, in the end, we know that they are a rubber stamp for what the president wants. Not everyone's like Rand Paul going off in his own direction and talking about the debt out of the Big Beautiful Bill. I don't agree with a lot of what he says, but he's right about that debt. He's right about what happened with that bill.",
      "Most of them are just going to rubber-stamp what President Trump says. That's why it was so important to get this meeting. And I hope he sees it not\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: The president, not as political theater, but as real people who are facing a crisis right now\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 whether it's in the cities, the suburbs, or the rural areas of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sit on the Judiciary Committee, so I want to ask you about what's happening right now.",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, resigned after failing to bring a case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. We just spoke about her with Robert Costa.",
      "Monday, Lindsey Halligan was sworn in as the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. She has never prosecuted a case before. Three days into this new job, she moved forward with the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on two counts.",
      "Have you spoken to your fellow Republicans on the Judiciary Committee? Do they have concerns about what's happening in Virginia?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, I plan on doing that this week.",
      "And what I see this, as a former prosecutor myself, this is weaponizing the Justice Department, basically taking a career prosecutor who was recommended by the Republican governor of the state of Virginia, clearly has Republican roots, who made a decision based on the evidence over a period of months, made a decision.",
      "Then he's pushed out, forced out, so that the president can install his own aide into the job. When I questioned Attorney General Bondi during her confirmation hearing, she assured me that politics would not play a role, that they would make independent decisions.",
      "That is not what this is. This is a vengeance prosecution. It is not about the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You also worked on investigating January 6, 2021, and the attack of the United States Capitol.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel yesterday said publicly 274 FBI agents were \u2013 quote \u2013 \"thrown into crowd control\" on that day, against FBI standards. President Trump also said publicly that FBI agents acted as agitators who were secretly placed against all rules, regulations, protocols and standards into the crowd prior to and during the attack.",
      "This contradicts what the inspector general said in a published report that said there was no evidence of undercover employees in the crowd and that there were hundreds of special agents and employees who came in after the Capitol Hill police asked for them.",
      "This is now newly in focus because the president put the focus there. What was the role of the FBI that day?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I chaired the investigation of the security problems along a bipartisan investigation with Senator Peters and then- Senator Blunt and Senator Portman. This went on. We had a number of open hearings.",
      "And we made major, major recommendations for changes at the Capitol. And nowhere was it found that the FBI was acting as agitators. In fact, they were called in when there was such a delay in bringing in the military to insist \u2013 to assist in what was essentially an insurrection, where over 100 police officers were injured or maimed because of this criminal activity at the Capitol.",
      "So, I just find it appalling that the president would say that the FBI was somehow part of this. Kash Patel did clarify that, in fact, they were brought in after the fact. But they were brought in because we needed help. Senators, Republicans and Democrats were calling the military leaders. They were calling the attorney general. They were asking for help, because that help was not coming to the Capitol.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: And everyone has seen those facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your insight there. We will be watching what happens here, as the president tweeted both of those things and in reference to former Director Chris Wray.",
      "We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner.",
      "Good morning.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here in person.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thanks. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about Ukraine, which you just returned from.",
      "But, before I do that, let's button up where we left the conversation with Senator Klobuchar. FBI Director Chris Wray was twice spoken about in public statements by the president yesterday, and he said he has some explaining to do. He seemed to be connecting it to the FBI and January 6.",
      "Are you at all concerned by the former director's actions?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I do think there \u2013 with this new information, there's going to have to be some explaining as to, what is this new information and how does this relate to January 6?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, the number of the agents, the 274?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes, this does seem to be significantly different than what anyone has heard before, and how does this relate to the circumstances of what occurred there?",
      "Certainly, Kash Patel, as he's bringing this forward, this is going to be information that I think does relate. It really does go to everyone's confidence of what we currently know about that day. There's been a number of investigations, a number of people who've looked at this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: This certainly is concerning, and I think it is a matter\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What \u2013 but what part is concerning? Because that inspector general report said months ago that there were several hundred FBI agents who responded after the Capitol Police asked them to be there.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But it's the issue of, what was their role? What did they do?",
      "That aspect, I think, certainly \u2013 as we look at this information, as the FBI looks at the information, is it the same? Is it the same information that has been looked at before or is it different? And that certainly bears a review, and that, I think, will occur.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when the president says Chris Wray has some explaining to do, how do you interpret that?",
      "Because the inspector general report is public. Kash Patel said those individuals were there. It's not standard to send them, but it was disclosed they were there after the Capitol\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, as the information comes forward \u2013 I mean, obviously, the current FBI director and the FBI is going to have to come forward with the information. That information will be reviewed.",
      "And then, ultimately, the FBI is going to have to and I think that the prior director will have to explain how this information relates to what we have looked at before. And it's either going to be the same and prove that it is as everyone believed the circumstances were before, or it's going to be different.",
      "And, at that point, we're going to have to look at, how does it relate to what we believe we knew and how does it relate to what we now see?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to be\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But we don't know, because I have no information and I think no one else has any additional information, besides what the news reports are, and we will have to review what that information is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to be very clear, because it is such a dangerous information environment in so many ways, you are not in any way suggesting that the FBI was secretly agitating, which is what the president said, the attack on January 6?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I'm not suggesting anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And I don't think you are either.",
      "I think what we're both suggesting is that this currently is in news reports. And those news reports certainly bear a review of the information that's going to come forward. And that information is either going to tell us that it's the same information that has been seen before\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 or it's going to be new information. And if it's new information, that's going to need to be reviewed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, and I want to talk about your trip to Ukraine on the other side of it. But I have to do this right now.",
      "So, stay with us, all of you.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with Congressman Mike Turner, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine and former White House special counsel to Trump Ty Cobb.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "We return now to our conversation with Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner.",
      "Congressman, we were showing video there earlier of the overnight attack Russia carried out against Ukraine. You were just there in Kyiv. I'm sure you welcomed what the president said this week when he said he now has changed his mind and he does believe Ukraine could win this war and get its territory back from Russia. But he also added, he wishes everyone well when he made that statement. So, is he telling us that the United States is walking away from Ukraine and leaving it up to them, or is he signaling that the United States is going to help Ukraine win that territory back?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-OH): Well, we definitely need to help. And this is part of, you know, the dirty secret that really where the United States really needs to step it up. And it's part of the meeting that he had with the president of the E.U. commission.",
      "You know, the United States is providing aid to Ukraine. But at the same time, the west, and E.U. and the United States is subsidizing Russia and its production machine because, you know, we're buying from China and India that is buying energy from Russia. And the E.U. is buying energy from Russia.",
      "So, we need to place sanctions on Russia so that we're not funding their economy, which is funding their ability to attack and kill Ukraine. So, we're funding both sides of this.",
      "Unfortunately, there are those in Congress that want to stop supporting Ukraine's ability to defend themselves. Well, that will just result in more attacks from Russia as we saw last night against Ukraine. That's not going to get us to peace. The only way to get us to peace, and \u2013 and Trump's vision of peace, is to impact their ability for production, to stop subsidizing Russia's economy and their ability for production and killing Ukrainians, and that's to adopt Lindsey Graham and Brian Fitzpatrick's bill that would impose sanctions. Give the president the ability to impact Russia's ability to wage this war and get us to peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Speaker Johnson has said before that he would put that bill to a vote. He just hasn't. And he said, oh, I need the \u2013 the president to green light it. That's not true. We has a veto-proof majority. We've had Senator Graham on this program a million times telling us this is set to go, just give us the green light.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did Speaker Johnson respond to your request to move?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: No. And he's \u2013 and the momentum is here. We need to do this now. The president doesn't need to give us the green light. He's not a red light. The last time that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, leadership is not acting on it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And we \u2013 and we're coming back. And we need to do so. And we need to do so now. The last time we put on the floor the \u2013 the bill that would have stopped funding Ukraine, there were 3,000 \u2013 300 members voted for it. And if we put the bill on the floor to stop \u2013 to put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their economy, it would be similar. Over 300 members would vote for it.",
      "The only way to peace is to put sanctions on Russia, continue our support for Ukraine, which is what we're doing, what the president's going to be doing, and \u2013 and bring this war to an end. Support Trump's vision of peace, put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their \u2013 their war economy.",
      "Now what I saw in Ukraine, which is what's really incredible, is that they are winning modern warfare. What they're doing with their anti-drone technology, I mean, they are really the tech bros of the future. They are implementing on the front line anti-drone air defense technology that is winning this war. With our help and assistance, which they're going to continue to need for the long-range systems that Russia is bringing in and that are attacking Kyiv with. But with their anti-drone technology that no one else has, that they are implementing, they are winning this war. We need to be on the side of \u2013 of \u2013 that war of the future that they're winning and support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I've heard military officials explain this to \u2013 to me, that this is like a really interesting test case to learn the lessons that Ukraine is \u2013 is illustrating for the world. However, in \u2013 in the immediate term, will the president lift restrictions on Ukraine's ability to use long-range weapons to actually attack Russia?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, and he really needs to do so. Because what's happening with that pressure that's on the front lines \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because he has the old Biden policy.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right. Well, he does. And that's what he needs to release. Because with the pressure on the front line, and the fact that Ukraine has developed anti-drone technology, where they're taking down Russian drones, they're using their own drones to attack Russia. But Russia has long-range weapons that they're attacking that front line.",
      "Ukraine needs to have the ability to use long-range weapons to push Russia back. And when they're able to do that, they will get their territory back. If they are able to do that, they will win this war. And if we put sanctions on Russia impacting their ability to produce their war machine and production, they will be able to win this modern warfare and we'll be on the right side of what \u2013 this is not old time war. This is modern war. And we're being (ph) on the right side of Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've just got to persuade President Trump to do that, that change in policy.",
      "When we were in France last week, speaking to President Macron, I asked him about those incursions into European air space. Some would say by Russian drones or Russian jets. Others have said they still need to investigate. We've seen drones or jets into Poland, Estonia, Romania, Norway, possibly Denmark. What should the United States be doing to push back on those provocations?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: You know, what's interesting about this is \u2013 what we've also said that is that, you know, Russia, once they get through Ukraine, would be testing and going \u2013 continue into Europe. But what they're seeing \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that what they're doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But what they're seeing now, because they're having this \u2013 this success of Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine. They're now going into Poland and Romania and they're seeing that Poland and Romania don't have the advanced technology that Ukraine does. And instead of going through Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine. Since \u2013 since this is modern warfare and Ukraine's winning it, they're seeing that the old war is actually old Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike Turner, thank you for sharing some of your insights which you learned on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back in a moment. So, stay us.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who joins us this morning from Richmond.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-VA): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have, what, 140,000 federal civilian workers in your state. One of the highest numbers in the nation. How concerned are you that you will see mass layoffs if we go into this shutdown that the White House says they are preparing for?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, and I think your reporter Robert Costa said they're even welcoming it. We are really worried about it, Margaret. When - - when Ted Cruz forced a shutdown of the government in October 2013, it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And when Donald Trump forced a shutdown of the government in late 2018, early 2019, it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And this one would be the same.",
      "The only thing about the president's threat to fire more people is, he's already doing it. And instead of threatening, he should just be meeting to negotiate.",
      "We came near shutdown deadlines during the Biden administration, but we never shut government down because the president would sit down with congressional leaders of both parties and would find a path forward. And that's what we've been asking for since the Democrats put an alternate plan on the table on September 18th, just sit down and talk with us. And, finally, he has agreed to do that tomorrow. But if you're reporting is to be believed, he's sort of going into it setting \u2013 reducing expectations improperly. He should be doing what presidents do and saying we're going to find a deal to keep the government of the greatest nation on earth open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it enough of a deal to say, take the short-term seven-week funding deal and we'll continue to talk about these health care subsidies that Democrats say they are so concerned about? I mean is it really worth the risk?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Here's \u2013 here's my thought about this, Margaret. This - - my personal view. We've got to solve this health care issue, and Republicans are saying the same thing. Mike Johnson has said it. Senator Cornyn has said it. Senator Hawley has said it. Senator Murkowski has said it. We're asking to fix a problem that even Republicans want to fix.",
      "I don't think we have to have every detail pinned down with all the i's dotted and t's crossed in order to do a short-term extension. But I do want to see that Republicans are saying, you're right, we can fix this, and here's the path to finding a fix.",
      "And the second thing we need, which is so reasonable, we're just asking, if we do a deal, please don't, Mr. President, sign the deal and then immediately the next day start \u2013 starting to take away funds, rescinding agreements that you just made yesterday. A deal should be a deal. And we should all agree that Americans should not see their health care suffer, their premiums spike, and people lose insurance and providers close.",
      "We've already had providers in Virginia announce that they are closing their doors because of the bill that the Republicans passed in July. And this is happening all over the country. Let's just do what's right by our constituents and fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you another question specific to Virginia, and that is what is going on inside the judicial system. Back in August it was the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, Todd Gilbert, who suddenly resigned. Then, earlier this month, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Eric Siebert, resigned after failing to bring a case against New York's Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "What is going on here in the Virginia court system?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, I \u2013 it's pretty darn plain. The president nominated two U.S. attorneys in Virginia, both with Republican bona fides. Todd Gilbert, in the western district, had been the Republican speaker of our house of delegates. He resigned as a legislator to take the Trump appointment. President Trump's team interviewed these candidates, approved the candidates, nominated the candidates, and then even appointed them into the interim position. But both were forced out because they said their integrity as prosecutors would not allow them to genuflect to Donald Trump.",
      "In Todd Gilbert's case they wanted to force him to demote a long time career member of the Western District of Virginia, who had served under multiple administrations and presidents. He refused to do so. And in Eric Siebert's case, he refused to bring a criminal charge against a perceived Trump political opponent when there was no evidence to support the charge.",
      "President Trump spending time going after enemies, trying to figure out a way to give $20 billion to a friend, the Argentine government, instead of dealing with the challenges we elected him to confront. Food prices are going up. Building supplies are going up. School supplies are going up. And energy costs are going up. Health care costs are going up. And Donald Trump seems to be focused on a retribution campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: You got to focus, man. This is an important job. It's time to focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when it comes to those Virginia cases, have you talked to Siebert, have you talked to Gilbert to understand why they felt they had to resign?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I have talked to each of them after the resignations were done. These were individuals \u2013 I knew both \u2013 I knew Todd Gilbert because of his legislative role and I knew Eric Siebert very well by reputation. And again, this was the prosecutor, Margaret, who, when the Biden administration transitioned to the Trump administration, the Trump administration DOJ put him in the role as an interim even before we recommended him, along with our Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, as you mentioned.",
      "So, after they had been fired, yes, I did call and say I'd like to understand why you were forced out. And they shared thoughts with me without getting into anything about particular cases or particular communication they'd had with Trump administration officials.",
      "But I am convinced, and Virginians are convinced \u2013 I traveled around the state this week, people are talking about this. Both of these individuals had a backbone. They wouldn't genuflect to Donald Trump and they wouldn't bring baseless cases. And we shouldn't see that in any district in this nation. And it's sad that President Trump is more focused on retribution than serving his constituents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that eastern district did come forward with this indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. Yes, it was just a two-page indictment. No evidence presented publicly here. But it was convincing enough to 14 of 23 people sitting on a grand jury. Can you really say there's no there there?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: A bare \u2013 a \u2013 well, a bare majority, as you know, Margaret, there's 23 people on a grand jury. They need at least 12 votes to get an indictment. And, yes, they got their finger over the bar with 14. Although the 23 wouldn't agree on one of the charges that the U.S. attorney was pushing. So, we will see what this case is about.",
      "It is odd that the indictment has so few facts. And I found it very odd. I used to practice in this court. And when the attorney general put out a press statement after the indictment and said, we will follow the facts in this case. What? Prosecutors follow the facts before they indict.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: They don't indict and then say, well, let's see what the facts are. I think she even revealed that this is a weak case, which everyone in her office was telling her it was a weak case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 on your Armed Services role I want to quickly ask you. You have said you are supportive of the creation of a Palestinian state.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we saw at the U.N. this past week a large number of members just simply walked out when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke. It was a statement. Tomorrow, he's going to be at the White House. Ahead of that meeting, President Trump said this.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There's been enough. It's time to stop now. OK?",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a strong statement. Do you know how the United States should enforce that? How do you force Israel to step back from annexation?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, I was very heartened that the president said that. And \u2013 and you're right, I support what the United States voted for in the U.N. in 1947, a state of Israel and a state of Palestine. One of those promises has been met. One hasn't. And we need to be on a path for a Palestinian state that's demilitarized where Hamas plays no role in its governance. And until we find that path forward, we're going to have continued cycles of violence that are bad for Israelis, bad for Palestinians, bad for the region.",
      "So, I hope the president, who by all accounts has a strong relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, makes plain that we are \u2013 we are against annexation and this 21-point proposal that the president has on the table, which is pretty similar to the New York dialogue being led by the French and the Saudis, they're \u2013 they're different efforts, but they're trying to reach the same point, a future state for Israel and Palestine where both can live in peace and creating stability in the region instead of the cycles of violence.",
      "So, I hope the president leans into that at the meeting tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I was heartened by his comment. It would be a big mistake for the prime minister, Netanahu, to look at all of the nations that have been allies saying you need to change course and for him to just pull his head in the shell and turn inward and continue to isolate Israel rather than move forward toward peace and more stability in the region.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Ty Cobb. He served as White House special counsel for just under a year during the first Trump administration, helping to coordinate the response to Robert Mueller's probe of Russian influence on the 2016 election.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "TY COBB (Former White House Special Counsel to the President): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw this action against former FBI Director James Comey this past week and he was indicted on two charges specific to his September 2020 testimony to Congress about Russian election meddling in 2016. The so-called crossfire hurricane.",
      "In your view, from what you've heard of this case, do you think it has enough substance to actually head to trial?",
      "TY COBB: I don't really. You know, as you and Senator Kaine discussed briefly moments ago, that the grand jury rejected one of the counts, the top count actually in the indictment, approved two, but by a very slim margin, 14 out of 23, in a process where there's no defense attorney in the room and the standard is merely probable cause. You know, the next courtroom that this will be assessed in, if it gets to trial, requires unanimity from 12 people, and \u2013 and there will be a vigorous defense. I don't see any way in the world that, you know, Comey would be convicted. And I think there's a good chance because of, you know, the wholly unconstitutional authoritarian way that this was done that the case may get tossed out well before trial.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wholly unconstitutional and authoritarian. That's \u2013 that's quite a description. You used to work for President Trump. What makes you now characterize his actions that way?",
      "TY COBB: That's true. I used to work \u2013 well, I used to work at the White House as \u2013 as a lawyer, you know, interacting with the Justice Department in the Mueller investigation and other matters. And I was not Trump's personal lawyer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "TY COBB: So, my role was really, you know, as a \u2013 as a government employee and not personal to the \u2013 to the president. He did have personal lawyers.",
      "But, you know, at the time, you know, I was trying to perform the duties that were assigned to me. In this \u2013 in this circumstance, you know, I'm eight years removed from that. I don't \u2013 I don't have any allegiances or reasons to, you know, say anything other than balls and strikes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TY COBB: And, you know, former Attorney General Jackson, Justice Jackson, Nuremberg prosecutor, himself highlighted in 1940 that the most important thing at the Justice Department, when he was attorney general, was that people not target individuals. That they merely pursue crimes. Griffin Bell, you know, years later, 1978, you know, said essentially the same thing, emphasized how, you know, political \u2013 politics and, you know, favor have no business at the Justice Department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TY COBB: It's all about even handedness. And I think we talked about the misrepresentations that Attorney General Bondi made about how she would proceed evenhandedly and, you know, she's wholly abandoned that now and is now merely doing the president's bidding when he says prosecute my enemies now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, \"The New York Times\" is reporting that half a dozen U.S. attorneys' offices have been ordered to draft plans to investigate a group funded by George Soros, who is a Democratic donor. You look at that, you look at the lists of names of others who the president has said he specifically wants to be prosecuted or investigated. I'll read a few of them to you. Two former Trump officials, Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor. He also said he wants a federal investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith. The DOJ fired the 35 lawyers who were involved in the January 6th and classified documents cases. The Justice Department is now going after Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis' travel records. We have quite an exhaustive list here. What is the pattern you see?",
      "TY COBB: Well, I think if you go to 30,000 feet, what you see is a lot of moving parts, but simple themes. The simple themes are rewriting history. Trump wants to rewrite history so that, you know, the next generation may not know that he incited a violent insurrection, refused to peacefully transfer the power of the presidency after losing an election, stole classified documents and showed them to, you know, friends and guests at Mar-a-Lago. You know, and that \u2013 that he was a criminal. I mean, he's a convicted felon. All \u2013 all anybody involved in those events that offended him, they're in \u2013 they're in real danger.",
      "So, you have the rewriting of history stuff. You know, the U.S. attorney that he appointed his personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, you know, her \u2013 her role previously in the administration was, you know, trying to eliminate the theory that, you know, America, you know, had slaves at the Smithsonian. She was there to, you know, whitewash the Smithsonian.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TY COBB: And paint America as \u2013 paint American as something that \u2013 that it isn't. I mean America needs to learn from the mistakes and lessons that we've had. And one of the biggest mistakes that \u2013 that America ever had was re-electing President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a number of Republican lawmakers are declining to speak out and are leaving the door open that these cases are legitimate. Do you think that the judicial system can resist what you are saying here as just simply politically motivated pressure?",
      "TY COBB: I think that's an excellent question. I think, you know, the founders, when they \u2013 when they drafted the Constitution, Article One is to Congress and Congress has the greatest powers under the Constitution. Spending power, war power, impeachment. Congress is really there to check the presidency.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TY COBB: Congress has been neutered by the cowardice of the Republicans. Mike Johnson won't even seat \u2013 recently elected Representative Grijalva because he doesn't want her to tip the balance on the \u2013 on the Epstein vote.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "TY COBB: So, Congress is totally in the tank and the judiciary is doing \u2013 doing its best.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going \u2013 I'm going to have to put you off. I'm sorry.",
      "TY COBB: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to have to cut you off, I'm sorry, because we're out of time there.",
      "TY COBB: Sure.",

    "story": [
      "Officials on Saturday put the leader of Iowa's largest school district on administrative leave, a day after federal immigration agents detained him because they said he was in the country illegally.",
      "The Des Moines school board voted unanimously to place Superintendent Ian Roberts on paid leave during a three-minute-long special meeting. The board said Roberts was not available to carry out his duties for the 30,000-student district and stated that officials would reassess his status after getting more information.",
      "After the meeting, school board president Jackie Norris read a statement, saying word of Roberts' detention Friday made for a \"jarring day\" but noting that board members still didn't have all the facts.",
      "In a statement on social media, Norris said the school district had \"no confirmed information\" about why Roberts was detained and the associate superintendent would be stepping in in his place. The school said they had not been told of the \"next potential steps\" by immigration authorities.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said agents detained Roberts because he was in the country illegally, didn't have authorization to work and was subject to a final removal order issued in 2024. ICE agents stopped Roberts while he was driving a school-issued vehicle, and the agency said he then fled into a wooded area before being apprehended with help from Iowa State Patrol officers.",
      "\"I want to be clear, no one here was aware of any citizenship or immigration issues that Dr. Roberts may have been facing,\" Norris said. \"The accusations ICE had made against Dr. Roberts are very serious, and we are taking them very seriously.\"",
      "Norris said Roberts has retained a Des Moines law firm to represent him. Lawyer Alfredo Parrish confirmed his firm was representing Roberts but declined to comment on his case.",
      "Norris also repeated that the district had done a background check on Roberts before he was hired that didn't indicate any problems and that he signed a form affirming he was a U.S. citizen. A company that aided in the search for a superintendent in 2023 also hired another firm to conduct \"comprehensive criminal, credit and background checks\" on Roberts that didn't indicate any citizenship issues, Norris said.",
      "Also Saturday, the Iowa Department of Education released a statement saying Roberts stated he was a U.S. citizen when he applied for an administrator license. The department said the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners conducted a criminal history check with state and federal authorities before issuing a license.",
      "The department said it is reviewing the Des Moines district's hiring procedures for ensuring people are authorized to work in the U.S.",
      "According to CBS Des Moines affiliate KCCI, the district said Roberts underwent a background check in 2023 by a private contractor, and during the hiring process, he made the board aware of a firearm charge related to a hunting rifle, and provided \"sufficient context and explanation\" to move forward.",
      "Roberts was licensed by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners, the district told KCCI.",
      "Roberts had previously said he was born to immigrant parents from Guyana and spent much of his childhood in Brooklyn, New York. He competed in the 2000 Olympics in track and field for Guyana.",
      "ICE said he entered the U.S. on a student visa in 1999.",
      "A former senior Guyanese police official on Saturday remembered Roberts as a middle-distance runner who could have risen through the ranks of the South American country's police force had he not emigrated to the U.S. decades ago. Retired assistant Guyana Police Force commissioner Paul Slowe said Roberts entered the Police Force after graduating from the country's standard military officers' course.",
      "\"He served for a few years and then left. He was not dismissed or dishonorably discharged at all; he just moved on,\" Slowe told The Associated Press. \"He was a good, promising and disciplined man.\"",

      "President Trump told his administration on Friday to declassify any federal records about Amelia Earhart, the pilot whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has drawn decades of public fascination.",
      "\"Amelia made it almost three quarters around the World before she suddenly, and without notice, vanished, never to be seen again,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"Her disappearance, almost 90 years ago, has captivated millions.\"",
      "Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared as they flew toward Howland Island in the Pacific, part of her attempt to become the first female aviator to circumnavigate the world.",
      "It's widely believed that Earhart crashed into the ocean near Howland Island after running out of fuel, says Laurie Gwen Shapiro, a journalist who wrote a book on Earhart. But other theories about where she and her plane ended up have circulated for decades \u2014 many of which lack clear evidence. Researchers are planning an expedition to a remote island later this year.",
      "It's not clear what, if any, classified documents the government may have on Earhart.",
      "But a lawmaker who represents the Northern Mariana Islands territory in the U.S. House pushed Mr. Trump to declassify and release Earhart records earlier this year, referring to \"credible, firsthand accounts\" that the aviator was spotted on the Pacific island of Saipan.",
      "\"Despite these recollections, her disappearance and the possibility that she may have died on our islands remain matters of unresolved historical inquiry,\" Del. Kimberlyn King-Hinds, a Republican, wrote in a July letter to the president.",
      "One of the theories is that Earhart was on a spy mission for the U.S. government when she landed in Saipan and was taken into custody by the Japanese.",
      "Documents previously released by the FBI contain a 1967 request for a security review of a manuscript that cites Navy files on Earhart that were marked \"confidential,\" a level of classification. The manuscript's author, a senior officer in the Air Force, wrote that the conclusions in the Navy report were that Earhart was not on a spy mission, did not crash-land in Saipan, and was not held as a prisoner or executed as a spy.",
      "The FBI, in approving that manuscript for publication \u2014 which is a typical process for current and former government officials \u2014 noted that the Navy files did \"not warrant classification since the release of it would not be prejudicial to the national defense.\"",
      "Shapiro called the theory that Earhart was taken captive in Saipan \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"It's 99.9% that she ran out of gas,\" Shapiro told CBS News. She said Earhart and Noonan were low on fuel and \"very ill-prepared\" for their attempted flight to Howland Island, a tiny, difficult-to-find island in the middle of the ocean.",
      "\"It's very boring to tell people, you know what, she ran out of gas,\" Shapiro said. \"The fantasy around it is amazing.\"",
      "The National Archives and Records Administration has also previously\u00a0released documents\u00a0on the search for Earhart.",
      "In 1993, two Hawaiian lawmakers introduced bills in the House and Senate to require the government to release all records relating to Earhart's last flight and disappearance. The bills called for the declassification of \"any such relevant records that have been classified as government secrets.\" The measures never made it out of the committees they were referred to.",
      "Mr. Trump's push to declassify Earhart records follows his decision to release records on the 1960s-era assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. His administration is also under pressure to release records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

      "In a joint U.S.-Mexican operation last month, authorities tracked down a cartel leader accused of running a gruesome infant trafficking ring in northern Mexico, according to senior intelligence officials.",
      "Martha Alicia Mendez Aguilar, known as \"La Diabla,\" was captured on Sept. 2 after officials say the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, referred to by the U.S. as CJNG, lured a handful of pregnant women \u2014 often in vulnerable or impoverished circumstances \u2014 to remote areas. Once there, CJNG traffickers allegedly performed illegal cesarean operations on the women, killing the mothers and allegedly harvesting their organs postmortem, and placing newborns into illicit markets, according to senior intelligence officials. The infants were then sold to couples in the United States for as much as 250,000 pesos or roughly $14,000 each, according to the senior intelligence officials.",
      "Mexican authorities were tipped off by intelligence provided by the National Counterterrorism Center, under the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. NCTC Director Joe Kent called the scheme an \"example of what terrorist cartels will do to diversify their revenue streams and finance operations,\" in a statement provided to CBS News, crediting NCTC analysts with tracking Aguilar's patterns and locations, then coordinating with U.S. intelligence and Mexican partners on the ground.",
      "Senior intelligence officials say the arrest involved support from the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI El Paso, Diplomatic Security Service and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with Mexican law enforcement executing the operation alongside \"Fiscalia Especializada en la Mujer\" or the Special Prosecutor's Office for Women. Aguilar remains in Mexican custody, according to senior intelligence officials. The investigation into the alleged trafficking ring remains ongoing.",
      "The case underscores Washington's intensified targeting of Mexican cartels in recent years.",
      "In January, President Trump signed an executive order directing the State Department to designate cartels and transnational gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, or FTOs. The State Department in February announced the designation for eight gangs, including CJNG.",
      "The capture of \"La Diabla\" marks an expansion in the application of U.S. counterterrorism policy, with intelligence elements like NCTC now actively applying counterterrorism capabilities to target not only narcotraffickers, but also human trafficking rings and terroristic violence by groups like CJNG, notorious for brutal tactics and control over swaths of Mexico's territory.",
      "Under the new FTO framing, U.S. agencies wield more expansive tools, including intelligence, sanctions, and military support to track down the cartels and their affiliates, beyond reliance on traditional criminal prosecutions. Critics of the approach have warned of overreach and unintended consequences, while proponents argue that cartels increasingly function like hybrid terrorist groups to pick up territorial control and expand trafficking networks.",
      "According to NCTC, U.S. intelligence has added over 21,000 cartel members and associates into their classified terrorist database, creating over 35,000 identities related to the newly designated foreign terrorist organizations. Last month, the agency stated that 6,525 terrorists have been denied entry into the United States since the beginning of the Trump administration.",

      "A digital reconstruction of a million-year-old skull suggests humans may have diverged from our ancient ancestors 400,000 years earlier than thought and in Asia, not Africa, a study found.",
      "The findings, published Thursday, are based on a reconstruction of a crushed skull discovered in China in 1990 and have the potential to resolve the long-standing \"Muddle in the Middle\" of human evolution, researchers said.",
      "But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the findings were likely to be disputed and pointed to ongoing uncertainties in the timeline of human evolution.",
      "The skull, labelled Yunxian 2, was previously thought to belong to a human forerunner called Homo erectus.",
      "But modern reconstruction technologies revealed features closer to a species previously thought to have existed only later in human evolution, including the recently discovered Homo longi and our own Homo sapiens.",
      "\"This changes a lot of thinking,\" said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London, who was part of the research team.",
      "\"It suggests that by 1 million years ago, our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed,\" he added.",
      "The findings shocked the research team.",
      "\"From the very beginning, when we got the result, we thought it was unbelievable. How could that be so deep into the past?\" Xijun Ni, a professor at Fudan University who co-led the analysis, told BBC News. \"But we tested it again and again to test all the models, use all the methods, and we are now confident about the result, and we're actually very excited.\"",
      "If the findings are correct, it suggests there could have been much earlier members of other early hominins, including Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, the researchers said.",

      "\"There's a big change potentially happening here, where east Asia is now playing a very key role in hominin evolution,\" he told the Agence France-Presse.",
      "\"A lot of questions\"",
      "The research, published in the journal Science, used advanced CT scanning, structure light imaging and virtual reconstruction techniques to model a complete Yunxian 2. The team then printed replicas on a 3D printer, according to BBC News.",
      "The scientists relied in part on another similar skull to shape their model, and then compared it to over 100 other specimens.",
      "The resulting model \"shows a distinctive combination of traits,\" the researchers said, some of them similar to Homo erectus, including a projecting lower face.",
      "But other aspects, including its apparently larger brain capacity, are closer to Homo longi and Homo sapiens, according to the study.",
      "\"Yunxian 2 may help us resolve what's been called the 'Muddle in the Middle,' the confusing array of human fossils from between 1 million and 300,000 years ago,\" Stringer said in a press release.",
      "Much about human evolution remains debated, and Petraglia said the study's findings were \"provocative\" though grounded in solid work.",
      "\"It's sound, but I think the jury's still out. I think there will be a lot of questions raised,\" he said.",
      "Andy Herries, an archeologist at La Trobe University, said he was not convinced by the conclusions and that genetic analysis had shown fossil morphology, or shape, was \"not always a perfect indicator for human evolution.\"",
      "\"They've got this interpretation that I just don't really think is taking into account the genetic histories of these things that we do know,\" he told AFP.",
      "Dr. Aylwyn Scally, an evolutionary geneticist at Cambridge University, told BBC News that although the study's conclusions were plausible, they were far from certain, and that more evidence was needed to be sure.",
      "\"That picture is still quite unclear to us, so if the conclusions of this research are supported by other analyses, ideally from some genetic data, then I think we would start to be increasingly confident about it,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The findings are only the latest in a string of recent research that has complicated what we thought we know about our origins.",
      "Homo longi, also known as \"Dragon Man,\" was itself only named as a new species and close human relative in 2021, by a team that included Stringer.",

      "There were roughly 40,000 animals per square meter \u2014 mostly marine worms \u2014 living on the munitions,\u00a0the scientists wrote\u00a0in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.",

      "To find out what kind of bombs they were dealing with, he went online and found a manual from the Nazi air force Luftwaffe describing how to handle and store V-1 flying bombs. The cruise missile exactly matched the 10 bombs from the footage.",
      "Vedenin said \"there is some irony\" in the discovery that these \"things that are meant to kill everything are now attracting so much life.\"",
      "He compared it to how animals such as deer now thrive in radioactive areas abandoned by humans near the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.",

      "Animals once flocked to huge boulders that littered the Baltic Sea, however humans removed the stones to build infrastructure such as roads at the start of the 20th century.",

      "Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and \"huge and very powerful claws,\" said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.",
      "But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline \u2014 mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.",
      "\"Megaraptorans are among the least understood dinosaurs of all,\" Ibiricu told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhu\u00e9 Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.",
      "This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali \"fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,\" Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago \u2014 close to the time dinosaurs went extinct \u2014 and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.",
      "The front leg bone pressed against its jaws \u2014 belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles \u2014 could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.",
      "Study co-author Matt Lamanna told Reuters that unlike the T. rex, which had massive teeth and small arms, the Joaquinraptor likely used its long arms to capture prey.",
      "\"This suggests that these two predatory dinosaur lineages evolved different adaptations to accomplish basically the same thing - that is, to capture, subdue, kill and eat other animals such as other dinosaurs,\" Lamanna told Reuters. \"Precisely why these groups evolved along these different evolutionary pathways remains a mystery, but it shows that, during the Cretaceous, there was more than one way to be a top predator.\"",

      "One image from the Mid-Infrared Instrument shows an area known as Sagittarius B2 North, which is one of the most molecularly rich regions known to humans, NASA said. The images taken with Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument show gas and dust in the region in \"unprecedented detail,\" NASA said. In this image, stars appear only as blue pinpoints through the thick clouds.",
      "When using the telescope's Near-Infrared Camera, astronomers were able to see colorful stars illuminating bright clouds of gas and dust. The astronomers will continue to study these stars to learn more about their size and age, which will inform research into the process of star formation in Sagittarius B2.",
      "The new images still leave some questions for astronomers. Areas of Sagittarius B2 that look dark and empty are actually \"so dense with gas and dust that even Webb cannot see through them,\" NASA said. Those clouds of gas and dust will eventually become future stars, NASA said. The clouds also serve as a sort of \"cocoon\" for young stars.",
      "Researchers also hope the Webb telescope's instruments can help them learn why star formation in the center of the Milky Way is so low.",
      "\"Humans have been studying the stars for thousands of years, and there is still a lot to understand,\" said Nazar Budaiev, a graduate student at the University of Florida and the co-principal investigator of the study. \"For everything new Webb is showing us, there are also new mysteries to explore, and it's exciting to be a part of that ongoing discovery.\"",

      "Heading the lineup is NASA's\u00a0Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, the first to be deployed. The mission \"will use 10 scientific instruments to chart a comprehensive picture of what's roiling in space, from high-energy particles originating at the Sun, to magnetic fields in interplanetary space, to remnants of exploded stars in interstellar space,\" said NASA in a description of IMAP.",
      "The probe will scrutinize the outer limits of the heliosphere, the protective, solar wind-driven bubble of gas around our solar system, according to the space agency.",
      "As a bonus, IMAP will also be capable of providing advance notice of solar storms \u2014 a valuable 30-minute heads-up \u2014 for astronauts exploring the moon under NASA's Artemis program. Officials expect the observatory to be fully operational by the time four astronauts fly around the moon and back next year.",

      "In a letter submitted in response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, attorneys for Alphabet said the decision to bring back banned accounts reflected the company's commitment to free speech.",
      "\"No matter the political atmosphere, YouTube will continue to enable free expression on its platform, particularly as it relates to issues subject to political debate,\" the letter read, noting that a number of accounts were kicked off the platform between 2023 and 2024 for violating misinformation rules that don't exist anymore. Now, it said, \"YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect.\"",
      "The company in its letter also said it \"values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse\" and added that YouTube \"recognizes these creators are among those shaping today's online consumption, landing 'must-watch' interviews, giving viewers the chance to hear directly from politicians, celebrities, business leaders, and more.\"",
      "The move is the latest in a cascade of content moderation rollbacks from tech companies, who cracked down on false information during the pandemic and after the 2020 election but have since faced pressure from President Trump and other conservatives who argue they unlawfully stifled right-wing voices in the process.",
      "It comes as tech CEOs, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, have sought a closer relationship with the Republican president, including through high-dollar donations to his campaign and attending events in Washington.",
      "YouTube in 2023 phased out its policy to remove content that falsely claims the 2020 election, or other past U.S. presidential elections, were marred by \"widespread fraud, errors or glitches.\" Claims of fraud in the 2020 election have been debunked.",
      "The platform in 2024 also retired its standalone COVID-19 content restrictions, allowing various treatments for the disease to be discussed. COVID-19 misinformation now falls under YouTube's broader medical misinformation policy.",
      "Among the creators who have been banned from YouTube under the now-expired policies are prominent conservative influencers, including Dan Bongino, who now serves as deputy director of the FBI. For people who make money on social media, access to monetization on YouTube can be significant, earning them large sums through ad revenue.",
      "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and other congressional Republicans have pressured tech companies to reverse content moderation policies created under former President Joe Biden and accused Biden's administration of unfairly wielding its power over the companies to chill lawful online speech.",
      "In Tuesday's letter, Alphabet's lawyers said senior Biden administration officials \"conducted repeated and sustained outreach\" to coerce the company to remove pandemic-related YouTube videos that did not violate company policies.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content, and the Company has consistently fought against those efforts on First Amendment grounds,\" the letter said.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also accused the Biden administration of pressuring employees to inappropriately censor content during the COVID-19 pandemic. Elon Musk, the owner of the social platform X, has accused the FBI of illegally coercing Twitter before his tenure to suppress a story about Hunter Biden.",

Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.",
      "This will be MLB's first major rule change since sweeping adjustments in 2024. Those included a pitch clock, restrictions on defensive shifts, pitcher disengagements such as pickoff attempts and larger bases.",
      "The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers. While there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete, not everyone considers the skill a good thing.",

If you had a concern about safety at your own home, you'd make a few calls and fill the gaps \u2014 not call in an army. What we're seeing is not about public safety, it's about the President flexing political muscle under the guise of law and order, chasing a media hit at the expense of our community.\"",

      "Mr. Trump also expressed confidence that the American people will side with him if government funding expires in the coming days, and he believes Democrats will pay a political price for not working with him, on his terms, to further cut spending.",
      "\"They're not interested in fraud, waste and abuse,\" Mr. Trump said of the Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump will meet Monday with congressional leaders ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline for lawmakers to reach an agreement on a spending bill that would avert a shutdown.",
      "A source close to Mr. Trump told CBS News that the president privately welcomes the prospect of a shutdown because it will enable him to wield executive power to slash some government programs and salaries.",
      "Last week, the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies telling them to prepare layoff plans if there is a government shutdown.",
      "The memo, obtained by CBS News, tells agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices \u2014 a federal term for layoffs \u2014 for employees in programs, projects or activities that have discretionary funding that stops on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. It also goes further and says that employees should get RIF notices if they're in programs or projects \"not consistent with the President's priorities.\"",
      "In the interview Sunday, Mr. Trump cast the Democrats' current demands \u2014\u00a0 which in recent weeks have focused on seeking to extend Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies \u2014\u00a0 as ill-advised.",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump said, if the Democrats want to discuss health care, they should work with him to prevent undocumented migrants from accessing public benefits.",

      "\"Donald Trump knows, or at least I think he knows, that current federal law prohibits using taxpayer dollars for undocumented immigrants in connection with their health care. And no one is trying to change or reverse that law,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told MSNBC on Saturday. \"What we are doing is fighting to protect the healthcare of everyday Americans in the midst of this Republican-caused crisis that is devastating hospitals and nursing homes and community-based health clinics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet Monday with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Jeffries.",
      "The meeting comes after the president canceled an initial meeting last week, citing the Democrats' \"unserious and ridiculous\" demands.",

But Democrats put forward their own proposal that would keep the government funded until Oct. 31, along with implementing other priorities for the party, including their health-care request. In the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to advance most legislation, both the bill passed by the House House-passed bill to fund the government and the Democrats' proposal fell short.",
      "The Democrats' proposal included a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which Democrats have suggested is a red line for their support. The proposal would also roll back cuts to Medicaid in Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",
      "The Senate is returning to Washington on Monday after a weeklong recess, and will have little time to act to avert a shutdown. Echoing Mr. Trump, Thune told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that it's \"totally up to the Democrats\" whether the government shuts down, saying \"there is a bill sitting at the desk in the Senate right now\" that the House passed that would keep the government open.",
      "\"This decision, in my judgment at this point in time, is up to a handful of Democrats,\" Thune said. \"We need eight Democrats to pass it through the Senate.\"",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, told \"Face the Nation\" Sunday that \"Democrats are united in pushing\" on the health-care issue, adding that she's glad the president has decided to meet with leaders in Congress.",

      "When the Abilene Police Department made a traffic stop on Cole, he admitted he runs a Facebook account under the name Jay Dubya, and that he was behind the comments, the criminal complaint alleged. He told officers that he did not believe that the gay pride event should be allowed, according to the court document, but denied that he was going to shoot parade participants.",
      "Cole also admitted that he has a firearm. It wasn't clear whether he legally owns it.",
      "\"The threats were not conditional. The threats were specific,\" FBI Special Agent Samuel C. Venuti wrote in the affidavit. \"The threats were also specific to a particular set of victims: people participating in the gay pride parade tomorrow. With this level of specificity, COLE's comments were not mere idle or careless talk, exaggeration, or something said in only a joking manner.\"",
      "Venuti wrote that he visited Cole's former employer who told him Cole had recently quit his job and \"stormed out of the facility in anger.\" He had worked for the employer for over a year, Venuti wrote, and was described by coworkers as a \"hot head.\"",

      "Jail records show Cole was released from Taylor County Jail on Sept. 24. The next day, the court concluded that Cole must be detained pending trial for reasons including his prior criminal history, that the weight of evidence against him is strong and that his release poses \"serious danger to any person or the community.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-californias-redistricting-maps/",
    "published": "Sun, 28 Sep 2025 19:17:10 -0400",
    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's redistricting push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "Missouri has joined Texas and California in redrawing its congressional maps, as part of a redistricting push that could lead to Republicans drawing themselves as many as six extra House seats while Democrats' efforts could help them pick up five.",
      "The redistricting gambit began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the state's districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats.",
      "Then, in Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map earlier this month to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, signed the legislation on Sunday.",
      "Challenges remain for the maps in all three states. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create the new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Civil rights groups are also suing in Texas, claiming the maps are racially biased. And in California, the state's new map must be approved by voters in a November special election before it takes effect.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, includingIndiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The new maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's\u00a0 district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",

      "Team Europe is taking the\u00a0Ryder Cup back across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving the Americans to search for answers in what is becoming a lopsided series.",
      "Shane Lowry added his name to Irish lore in the Ryder Cup with a 6-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole Sunday that assured Europe of retaining the cup. Tyrrell Hatton halved his match to make Europe an outright winner for the 11th time in the last 15 matches.",
      "Luke Donald became the first European captain to win back to back in the Ryder Cup since Tony Jacklin in 1985 and 1987. He had 11 of the same 12 players who won big in Rome two years ago. Even more impressive was doing it on U.S. soil \u2014 at Bethpage Black, no less \u2014 with hostile fans that were loud and vulgar and relentless.",
      "The final score tally \u2014 Europe 15, United States 13 \u2014 was the only real surprise.",
      "The Americans at least showed a pulse and made their opponents sweat more than anyone imagined, storming back from the largest Sunday deficit ever against Europe.",
      "There was a moment where a comeback actually looked possible.",
      "Cameron Young and Justin Thomas won matches on the 18th hole. Bryson DeChambeau charged from 5 down to earn a halve. Scottie Scheffler avoided getting blanked by winning his heavyweight match against Rory McIlroy.",
      "Lowry, who contended with the worst of the New York crowds all week, had the last word.",
      "He birdied three of the last four holes, and his final putt will put him alongside other Irishmen who have produced Ryder Cup heroics \u2014 Graeme McDowell at Celtic Manor in 2010, Darren Clarke and his emotional week at The K Club, Paul McGinley at The Belfry in 2002.",
      "Russell Henley had a 1-up lead and twice had 10-foot birdie putts on the closing holes. He left both of them short. The last one set the stage for Lowry, who made the putt and set off a wild celebration as thousands of fans streamed through the exits.",
      "Lowry said to his caddie walking up the 18th, \"I have a chance to do the coolest thing in my life.\" And he did just that.",
      "The Americans tied a Ryder Cup record by winning 8 1/2 points from the 12 singles matches. They needed 10 points.",
      "The Americans still have a 27-16-2 lead in the series that date to 1927, but the modern Ryder Cup didn't start until 1979 when continental Europe was invited to the party. Since then, Europe has captured the cup 13 out of 19 times.",
      "McIlroy had said winning a road Ryder Cup was among the biggest accomplishments in golf. It's just not all that unusual. Europe has won five of the last 10 away from home.",
      "Europe's best players starred at Bethpage Black even as New York fans hurled abuse, building a record seven-point lead going into the 12 singles matches.",
      "Europe put a half-point on the board before a shot was hit. Viktor Hovland, who had a summer neck injury flare up on Saturday, was\u00a0forced to withdraw. Harris English, whose name had been put in the secret envelope, also sat out and the match was declared halved.",
      "That meant the Americans had to win nine of the 11 matches and halve another and they put up an astonishing fight, finally hearing cheers for the U.S. instead of only vitriol toward Europe.",
      "\"They played better than us,\" said U.S. captain Keegan Bradley, who said his one regret might be the way he set up the course. Bethpage Black has a reputation of being a beast, but the rough was trimmed back and then heavy rain during the week made the greens soft.",
      "There were birdies galore, a rarity at the Black. There was hostility from the crowd, typical of this region and this public golf course.",
      "And there was a European celebration, which is becoming all too familiar.",

The president's comments appeared to come in response to a report Thursday from right-leaning media.",
      "\"That's right, as it now turns out, FBI Agents were at, and in, the January 6th Protest, probably acting as Agitators and Insurrectionists, but certainly not as 'Law Enforcement Officials,'\" Mr. Trump said.",

    "summary": "Humberto became a hurricane on Friday over the central Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center said.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Humberto, the eighth named storm to emerge this hurricane season, is currently swirling over waters north of the Caribbean as a major hurricane. While forecasts currently predict Humberto won't ever touch land, there is a possibility it could interact with another system, now named Imelda, which is developing nearby in the western Atlantic.",
      "That's an unlikely outcome, said CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan. But if such a collision does occur, it could produce what's called\u00a0the Fujiwhara effect, a rare phenomenon in which two different storms merge and become entangled around a newly formed, common center.",
      "How the process plays out depends on the characteristics of the storms involved, according to the National Weather Service. The forecasting agency describes the Fujiwhara effect on its website as \"an intense dance\" between two tropical storms that can happen when they get close enough to each other on their respective tracks to reach a common point and either join together or spin around each other for a period of time before continuing along their individual paths.",
      "In the latter scenario, the storms involved must be comparably strong or large.",
      "\"Typically when one system is stronger than the other, the smaller and weaker system will get overrun by the larger, stronger one and completely eliminate it,\" Nolan said.",
      "Similar systems \"will dance around each other\" before going their separate ways, she continued, adding: \"Very rarely has a larger system absorbed a smaller one and become larger or stronger, but it is scientifically possible.\"",
      "\"With the two tropical troubles currently north of the Caribbean, these two may interact under the Fujiwhara effect in the days ahead,\" said Nolan. However, because the developing system \"appears to be much weaker than Humberto and several miles away from it,\" an interaction between the two \u2014 if one even takes place at all \u2014 may not result in a tangled gravitational \"dance.\"",
      "Humberto grew into a tropical storm Wednesday night while traveling over open waters in the central tropical Atlantic. It gained hurricane status early Friday morning and continued strengthening, reaching Category 5 on Saturday before fluctuating back down a bit.",
      "Forecasters expect it to move towards the northwest through Sunday, then pass west of Bermuda by Tuesday night. It will likely remain a powerful hurricane for several days, the hurricane center said.",
      "The second system churning near Humberto strengthened on Sunday into Tropical Storm Imelda. It's on a path to dump heavy rain over the Bahamas on Sunday and then approach the southeastern U.S. coastline in the early part of the week, bringing the threat of heavy rainfall from Florida through the Carolinas.",
      "South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency regarding potential impacts from the storm system on Friday. McMaster said the state's residents should monitor the forecast.",
      "\"While the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the entire state of South Carolina,\" McMaster said. \"We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump says another blue city needs federal protection. Plus, his opponents say he's stepping up a campaign of political retribution.",
      "President Trump now says that Portland, Oregon, is under siege and that he's sending troops there to protect ICE. But will his solution cause new problems?",
      "Back in Washington, Mr. Trump put his political opponents on notice after directing his Justice Department to indict former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): It's not a list, but I think there will be others. I mean, they're corrupt.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what can stop him from pursuing more cases?",
      "We will talk with the head of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Rand Paul.",
      "Plus, as the clock ticks down again towards a possible government shutdown, this round of the Washington blame game has the potential to hurt more than just the two parties. This time, the Trump administration is threatening to fire, instead of furlough, some federal workers, unless Democrats support their funding bill.",
      "Why won't they? We will ask two key Democrats in the Senate, Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar and Virginia's Tim Kaine.",
      "Overnight, Russia launches a massive attack involving hundreds of drones and missiles on Ukraine's capital city. Republican Congressman Mike Turner just returned from the region, and he will join us.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We have breaking news as we begin what is likely to be another turbulent week here in Washington. Congress faces a government shutdown deadline of October 1.",
      "Our Robert Costa spoke this morning to President Trump.",
      "Bob, top leaders, both parties, both sides of the Capitol, are coming to the White House. Did the president tell you he thinks a shutdown can be avoided?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: A shutdown looks likely at this point, based on my conversation this morning with President Trump.",
      "He says both sides are at a stalemate. Democrats want to extend health care subsidies that were part of the Affordable Care Act. But President Trump said his focus on health care is on preventing undocumented migrants from having access to any of the U.S. health care system.",
      "Now, it's illegal for any noncitizen to have that sort of access. But President Trump says, we're not going to have it \u2013 quote \u2013 \"We're not going to allow it\" in terms of moving forward on any discussion unless the Democrats come to his side on health care and don't focus on the subsidies.",
      "But, based on my conversations with top Democrats, that's not going to happen. So President Trump told me \u2013 quote \u2013 \"I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue.\"",
      "That makes a shutdown quite likely. And inside the White House, sources are saying President Trump actually welcomes a shutdown, in the sense that he believes he can wield executive power to get rid of what he calls waste, fraud, and abuse. And there is that memo, as you mentioned, that says the government is ready to have mass firings if a deal isn't struck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Reductions in force, right.",
      "Well, we also know that the president took some extraordinary public statements in the past few days. He publicly said he wants to see Adam Schiff, now a senator, Letitia James prosecuted, along with James Comey, the former FBI director, who is now indicted.",
      "Yesterday, he twice posted on social media about former FBI Director Chris Wray. Did the president tell you, is he planning prosecutions?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: I did not speak directly to the president about that today.",
      "But fishing around all weekend in his inner circle, it's clear this is just the beginning in terms of possible prosecutions of those who have scrutinized the president or criticized him over the years. You mentioned the mortgage policy potentially of Senator Adam Schiff of California. He's being discussed inside of the Trump administration.",
      "So is Letitia James, the New York attorney general, who sued the president over how he valued his real estate holdings. And there are others not even on our radar at this moment, like retired Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, who are being discussed as people who may have taken action against the administration or president in some way, allegedly, in the views of those inside, and they want to see the Justice Department hold them to account.",
      "There's such a gap right now in Washington. Republicans believe what President Trump is doing is accountability. Democrats are alarmed and see this as authoritarian government at work. And there's a real tension there that's not going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, and a justice system that has to deal with evidence and facts. And we're going to talk about all of this ahead with some of our guests.",
      "Robert Costa, thank you very much for your reporting.",
      "We want to go now to the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to start on that news you just heard that the president is basically expecting a shutdown and possibly to carry out these mass layoffs. Do you think all of this is just a threat to make Democrats fold?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, I think both sides have to look at the proposals for spending and decide, what is the best way forward for the country?",
      "The Republican proposal adds about $2 trillion in debt over the next year, so it'll be short $2 trillion. So, I oppose the Republican plan because it adds debt. The Democrat plan would add $3 trillion in debt. So, really, both plans are laden with deficit spending, and I think that's the biggest problem that our country faces.",
      "So I have actually proposed an alternative. I have proposed a penny plan, which would cut a little bit across the board, and my plan would balance over about five years. We got a vote on mine last week, and 36 Republicans supported it, 16 didn't, and no Democrats did. So my plan didn't pass either.",
      "But the plan that I would support would be a plan that reduces spending and reduces deficit spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we have this immediate deadline, though, of this week, and we know leaders are going to the White House.",
      "If we end up in this shutdown, do you think it is appropriate and legal for the executive to carry out the kind of mass firings that the budget director laid out in that memo this past week?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, there's been several cases adjudicated now all the way up to the Supreme Court, and the president seems to have won every one of them, on his ability to hire and fire within the executive branch.",
      "And I think this is understandable, because, in the executive branch, if the president can't fire them, who can? And so I think the president has a great deal of leeway over executive branch employees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Without consulting Congress?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: For hiring and firing people in the executive branch, I think he has a great deal of leeway. The court has upheld this repeatedly. And so I suspect they will.",
      "Even when Congress \u2013 the Democrats tried to protect this agency called the Consumer Financial Protection board. And they say, well, the funding will come from the Fed, you won't get to vote on the funding and the person hired can't be fired. Well, he did fire that person in 2020.",
      "And the courts upheld that in 2021 in the Supreme Court. And really, since then, every case, he has won. And, as you know, I'm equal parts critic of both Republicans and Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I have criticized Trump on things.",
      "But the one thing is on the hiring and firing. And I think he's going to win every one of those cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your role in Homeland Security. You are chairman of that oversight committee.",
      "The president announced yesterday, and I'm sure you saw his social media post, that he's going to send troops to Portland, Oregon. He called it a war-ravaged city. He said he's also going to send troops to any immigration facilities around the country which are \u2013 quote \u2013 \"under siege from attack by Antifa and other domestic terrorists\" \u2013 end quote.",
      "He said he's authorizing full force, if necessary. Do you know what full force means here? Do you know what's in store?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think he has the legal authority to send troops to protect federal buildings and federal proceedings, such as courts. And that's been around since the civil rights era. We have acknowledged that the federal government will sometimes come in, despite what states say.",
      "I do think it's better when the states agree to it, for example, I mean, in Chicago. Chicago is a nightmare. It is literally a war zone. And the people being hurt the worst are those who are poor and living in these communities. I have been to the most dangerous precinct in Chicago, and it's just despair and sadness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, but then \u2013 but you haven't been briefed on the plan for Oregon?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And these young boys have grown up with no families. There's no restaurants, no drugs.",
      "Excuse me? Say again, please.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have not been briefed on plans to send troops to Oregon?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Not for Portland, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because we have not yet seen troops in Chicago, though you're referencing the president's past threats to do so.",
      "In Oregon, the governor said there's no need and they don't want these troops. But the mayor said, the mayor of Portland, federal agents have been arriving, along with some armored vehicles. Are you comfortable with pushing the limits here of some of these uses of either potentially troops or federal agents?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think both the people in Portland and across America have to decide about this.",
      "We had anarchy in Portland for like six months or a year. The city didn't even control large swathes of the city. These had federal buildings on them. And so I think there is a role for the federal government. Am I excited about it? No, I'd prefer not to have troops in our cities, or I'd prefer them only to come with the acceptance of the local authorities.",
      "But I do think there is a role if the states will not step up. Portland did not step up, and they let their city go. They let it burn, for goodness' sakes. And then they let a whole area become the city \u2013 these blocks of anarchy, where some sort of local thug rule was going on.",
      "So, I don't know. I think, ultimately, what's going to happen \u2013 and I think some of this is the president showing the politics of Republicans versus Democrats \u2013 is, eventually, cities like Chicago and Portland are going to give up on Democrats, because their people are dying.",
      "It's their people in their community. The people who've been supporting the Democrat Party for decade after decade, they are the ones dying.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It's not the people in the rich neighborhoods or the country club Republican. It's poor people in every city who is dying, and the cities have to step up on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it sounded \u2013 well, I'm asking about your oversight role, because it seemed like the president's statement yesterday, it took a turn. It wasn't how he talked about Chicago.",
      "In fact, when he was speaking in this social media post about Portland, he used language here about domestic terrorists. And we know, just a few days ago, the president did issue that executive order saying he wanted to declare this anti-fascist group Antifa to be a domestic terrorist organization.",
      "Have you seen evidence that these left-wing activists are now becoming a more organized group with national leadership, something the FBI has said in the past that they're really more of an ideology?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, I think you lose the description as activists once you start wielding weapons and you show up with helmets and you're breaking windows. That's what was going on apparently in Portland at the ICE building.",
      "I do think, though, that it's important, when people start talking about labeling people, that we realize everybody, the worst among us, even those accused of heinous crimes, will get due process. So we can't single out a group and say, oh, they're not going to get due process because we're calling them terrorists.",
      "So I'd be careful of the labels, but I'm absolutely for going after the people wielding clubs and sticks and fighting with the police and trying to get into the federal buildings. They have to be punished, and they will be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you have concerns, though, about designating groups with these anti-government sentiments as domestic terrorist groups? I mean, do you start worrying about Fourth Amendment violations?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't know that it's helpful to label groups, particularly since Antifa \u2013 there are some real people in Antifa. They're real, violent people.",
      "But it is an amorphous group\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 in the sense that I don't think they have a president. They don't have a local chapter. It is more an ideology.",
      "And it was useful maybe around the world to call things terrorism, but there's different rules of engagement. When we have to go after terrorists in the Middle East, we send a Hellfire missile or a drone often. In the United States, it's much trickier to be a police \u2013 I have a great deal of respect for our police.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Because you're right. They have to respect the Fourth Amendment, the First Amendment. And so we have to be careful with labels.",
      "But it doesn't mean we should go soft on Antifa\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 and these people that are committing violence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator Rand Paul, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. She is a member of Democratic leadership. And she joins us this morning from Minneapolis.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-Minnesota): Thanks, Margaret. Great to be on again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we just heard from my colleague Robert Costa that the president indicated to him the likelihood of a shutdown and, with that, potentially mass firings.",
      "Do you think this is posturing or do you worry your fellow Democrats are walking into a trap?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I am glad the president has finally agreed to meet with the leadership in Congress. He canceled the meeting last week, which I think was a big mistake, because this is an opportunity for the country because of one big problem.",
      "And that is that the Republicans have created a health care crisis. My constituents, Americans, are standing on a cliff right now with these insurance premium increases that are upon them. So, Democrats are united in pushing on this and saying, look, let us do something about this crisis before it is too late, 75 percent increase in premiums starting November 1 on people who are small business owners\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 people who are farmers out there, twice as much in the rural areas.",
      "So that's what this is about to us. And the president prides himself in the art of a deal. This is the moment for him to meet with Democrats and come to an agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So those premiums go up November 1. You're talking about the extension of the health care subsidies. But insurance companies plan that a year out. So these premiums are already priced in here.",
      "Why not agree to the government\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Margaret, what we know is that these tax \u2013 if I could, just\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: OK. Go ahead.",
      "The tax credits are what really could make a difference here for people. Because of the fact that we know these premiums hit November 1, getting this done now is a now thing. It's not a December thing. It's not a January thing. It's not an off-ramp. It is something we have to get done now.",
      "As one of my farmers that I met with out in rural Minnesota said, when looking at the president's tariffs and looking at what's happened in farm country, five-year high in small farm bankruptcy, he said it's a perfect storm of ugly. That's where we are with the economy right now. And that's why we are pushing on what is one of the biggest cost drivers for Americans\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 in addition to groceries and electricity prices going up. It's health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, you couldn't take the seven-week funding and then negotiate that? You're saying it has to be agreed to right now?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: We believe this is a now problem.",
      "And while we are eager to talk with Senator Thune, I know Senator Schumer is, to get this moving, in the end, we know that they are a rubber stamp for what the president wants. Not everyone's like Rand Paul going off in his own direction and talking about the debt out of the Big Beautiful Bill. I don't agree with a lot of what he says, but he's right about that debt. He's right about what happened with that bill.",
      "Most of them are just going to rubber-stamp what President Trump says. That's why it was so important to get this meeting. And I hope he sees it not\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: The president, not as political theater, but as real people who are facing a crisis right now\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 whether it's in the cities, the suburbs, or the rural areas of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sit on the Judiciary Committee, so I want to ask you about what's happening right now.",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, resigned after failing to bring a case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. We just spoke about her with Robert Costa.",
      "Monday, Lindsey Halligan was sworn in as the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. She has never prosecuted a case before. Three days into this new job, she moved forward with the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on two counts.",
      "Have you spoken to your fellow Republicans on the Judiciary Committee? Do they have concerns about what's happening in Virginia?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, I plan on doing that this week.",
      "And what I see this, as a former prosecutor myself, this is weaponizing the Justice Department, basically taking a career prosecutor who was recommended by the Republican governor of the state of Virginia, clearly has Republican roots, who made a decision based on the evidence over a period of months, made a decision.",
      "Then he's pushed out, forced out, so that the president can install his own aide into the job. When I questioned Attorney General Bondi during her confirmation hearing, she assured me that politics would not play a role, that they would make independent decisions.",
      "That is not what this is. This is a vengeance prosecution. It is not about the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You also worked on investigating January 6, 2021, and the attack of the United States Capitol.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel yesterday said publicly 274 FBI agents were \u2013 quote \u2013 \"thrown into crowd control\" on that day, against FBI standards. President Trump also said publicly that FBI agents acted as agitators who were secretly placed against all rules, regulations, protocols and standards into the crowd prior to and during the attack.",
      "This contradicts what the inspector general said in a published report that said there was no evidence of undercover employees in the crowd and that there were hundreds of special agents and employees who came in after the Capitol Hill police asked for them.",
      "This is now newly in focus because the president put the focus there. What was the role of the FBI that day?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I chaired the investigation of the security problems along a bipartisan investigation with Senator Peters and then- Senator Blunt and Senator Portman. This went on. We had a number of open hearings.",
      "And we made major, major recommendations for changes at the Capitol. And nowhere was it found that the FBI was acting as agitators. In fact, they were called in when there was such a delay in bringing in the military to insist \u2013 to assist in what was essentially an insurrection, where over 100 police officers were injured or maimed because of this criminal activity at the Capitol.",
      "So, I just find it appalling that the president would say that the FBI was somehow part of this. Kash Patel did clarify that, in fact, they were brought in after the fact. But they were brought in because we needed help. Senators, Republicans and Democrats were calling the military leaders. They were calling the attorney general. They were asking for help, because that help was not coming to the Capitol.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: And everyone has seen those facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your insight there. We will be watching what happens here, as the president tweeted both of those things and in reference to former Director Chris Wray.",
      "We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner.",
      "Good morning.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here in person.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thanks. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about Ukraine, which you just returned from.",
      "But, before I do that, let's button up where we left the conversation with Senator Klobuchar. FBI Director Chris Wray was twice spoken about in public statements by the president yesterday, and he said he has some explaining to do. He seemed to be connecting it to the FBI and January 6.",
      "Are you at all concerned by the former director's actions?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I do think there \u2013 with this new information, there's going to have to be some explaining as to, what is this new information and how does this relate to January 6?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, the number of the agents, the 274?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes, this does seem to be significantly different than what anyone has heard before, and how does this relate to the circumstances of what occurred there?",
      "Certainly, Kash Patel, as he's bringing this forward, this is going to be information that I think does relate. It really does go to everyone's confidence of what we currently know about that day. There's been a number of investigations, a number of people who've looked at this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: This certainly is concerning, and I think it is a matter\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What \u2013 but what part is concerning? Because that inspector general report said months ago that there were several hundred FBI agents who responded after the Capitol Police asked them to be there.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But it's the issue of, what was their role? What did they do?",
      "That aspect, I think, certainly \u2013 as we look at this information, as the FBI looks at the information, is it the same? Is it the same information that has been looked at before or is it different? And that certainly bears a review, and that, I think, will occur.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when the president says Chris Wray has some explaining to do, how do you interpret that?",
      "Because the inspector general report is public. Kash Patel said those individuals were there. It's not standard to send them, but it was disclosed they were there after the Capitol\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, as the information comes forward \u2013 I mean, obviously, the current FBI director and the FBI is going to have to come forward with the information. That information will be reviewed.",
      "And then, ultimately, the FBI is going to have to and I think that the prior director will have to explain how this information relates to what we have looked at before. And it's either going to be the same and prove that it is as everyone believed the circumstances were before, or it's going to be different.",
      "And, at that point, we're going to have to look at, how does it relate to what we believe we knew and how does it relate to what we now see?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to be\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But we don't know, because I have no information and I think no one else has any additional information, besides what the news reports are, and we will have to review what that information is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to be very clear, because it is such a dangerous information environment in so many ways, you are not in any way suggesting that the FBI was secretly agitating, which is what the president said, the attack on January 6?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I'm not suggesting anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And I don't think you are either.",
      "I think what we're both suggesting is that this currently is in news reports. And those news reports certainly bear a review of the information that's going to come forward. And that information is either going to tell us that it's the same information that has been seen before\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 or it's going to be new information. And if it's new information, that's going to need to be reviewed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, and I want to talk about your trip to Ukraine on the other side of it. But I have to do this right now.",
      "So, stay with us, all of you.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with Congressman Mike Turner, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine and former White House special counsel to Trump Ty Cobb.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "We return now to our conversation with Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner.",
      "Congressman, we were showing video there earlier of the overnight attack Russia carried out against Ukraine. You were just there in Kyiv. I'm sure you welcomed what the president said this week when he said he now has changed his mind and he does believe Ukraine could win this war and get its territory back from Russia. But he also added, he wishes everyone well when he made that statement. So, is he telling us that the United States is walking away from Ukraine and leaving it up to them, or is he signaling that the United States is going to help Ukraine win that territory back?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-OH): Well, we definitely need to help. And this is part of, you know, the dirty secret that really where the United States really needs to step it up. And it's part of the meeting that he had with the president of the E.U. commission.",
      "You know, the United States is providing aid to Ukraine. But at the same time, the west, and E.U. and the United States is subsidizing Russia and its production machine because, you know, we're buying from China and India that is buying energy from Russia. And the E.U. is buying energy from Russia.",
      "So, we need to place sanctions on Russia so that we're not funding their economy, which is funding their ability to attack and kill Ukraine. So, we're funding both sides of this.",
      "Unfortunately, there are those in Congress that want to stop supporting Ukraine's ability to defend themselves. Well, that will just result in more attacks from Russia as we saw last night against Ukraine. That's not going to get us to peace. The only way to get us to peace, and \u2013 and Trump's vision of peace, is to impact their ability for production, to stop subsidizing Russia's economy and their ability for production and killing Ukrainians, and that's to adopt Lindsey Graham and Brian Fitzpatrick's bill that would impose sanctions. Give the president the ability to impact Russia's ability to wage this war and get us to peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Speaker Johnson has said before that he would put that bill to a vote. He just hasn't. And he said, oh, I need the \u2013 the president to green light it. That's not true. We has a veto-proof majority. We've had Senator Graham on this program a million times telling us this is set to go, just give us the green light.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did Speaker Johnson respond to your request to move?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: No. And he's \u2013 and the momentum is here. We need to do this now. The president doesn't need to give us the green light. He's not a red light. The last time that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, leadership is not acting on it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And we \u2013 and we're coming back. And we need to do so. And we need to do so now. The last time we put on the floor the \u2013 the bill that would have stopped funding Ukraine, there were 3,000 \u2013 300 members voted for it. And if we put the bill on the floor to stop \u2013 to put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their economy, it would be similar. Over 300 members would vote for it.",
      "The only way to peace is to put sanctions on Russia, continue our support for Ukraine, which is what we're doing, what the president's going to be doing, and \u2013 and bring this war to an end. Support Trump's vision of peace, put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their \u2013 their war economy.",
      "Now what I saw in Ukraine, which is what's really incredible, is that they are winning modern warfare. What they're doing with their anti-drone technology, I mean, they are really the tech bros of the future. They are implementing on the front line anti-drone air defense technology that is winning this war. With our help and assistance, which they're going to continue to need for the long-range systems that Russia is bringing in and that are attacking Kyiv with. But with their anti-drone technology that no one else has, that they are implementing, they are winning this war. We need to be on the side of \u2013 of \u2013 that war of the future that they're winning and support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I've heard military officials explain this to \u2013 to me, that this is like a really interesting test case to learn the lessons that Ukraine is \u2013 is illustrating for the world. However, in \u2013 in the immediate term, will the president lift restrictions on Ukraine's ability to use long-range weapons to actually attack Russia?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, and he really needs to do so. Because what's happening with that pressure that's on the front lines \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because he has the old Biden policy.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right. Well, he does. And that's what he needs to release. Because with the pressure on the front line, and the fact that Ukraine has developed anti-drone technology, where they're taking down Russian drones, they're using their own drones to attack Russia. But Russia has long-range weapons that they're attacking that front line.",
      "Ukraine needs to have the ability to use long-range weapons to push Russia back. And when they're able to do that, they will get their territory back. If they are able to do that, they will win this war. And if we put sanctions on Russia impacting their ability to produce their war machine and production, they will be able to win this modern warfare and we'll be on the right side of what \u2013 this is not old time war. This is modern war. And we're being (ph) on the right side of Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've just got to persuade President Trump to do that, that change in policy.",
      "When we were in France last week, speaking to President Macron, I asked him about those incursions into European air space. Some would say by Russian drones or Russian jets. Others have said they still need to investigate. We've seen drones or jets into Poland, Estonia, Romania, Norway, possibly Denmark. What should the United States be doing to push back on those provocations?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: You know, what's interesting about this is \u2013 what we've also said that is that, you know, Russia, once they get through Ukraine, would be testing and going \u2013 continue into Europe. But what they're seeing \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that what they're doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: But what they're seeing now, because they're having this \u2013 this success of Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine. They're now going into Poland and Romania and they're seeing that Poland and Romania don't have the advanced technology that Ukraine does. And instead of going through Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine. Since \u2013 since this is modern warfare and Ukraine's winning it, they're seeing that the old war is actually old Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike Turner, thank you for sharing some of your insights which you learned on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back in a moment. So, stay us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who joins us this morning from Richmond.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-VA): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have, what, 140,000 federal civilian workers in your state. One of the highest numbers in the nation. How concerned are you that you will see mass layoffs if we go into this shutdown that the White House says they are preparing for?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, and I think your reporter Robert Costa said they're even welcoming it. We are really worried about it, Margaret. When - - when Ted Cruz forced a shutdown of the government in October 2013, it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And when Donald Trump forced a shutdown of the government in late 2018, early 2019, it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And this one would be the same.",
      "The only thing about the president's threat to fire more people is, he's already doing it. And instead of threatening, he should just be meeting to negotiate.",
      "We came near shutdown deadlines during the Biden administration, but we never shut government down because the president would sit down with congressional leaders of both parties and would find a path forward. And that's what we've been asking for since the Democrats put an alternate plan on the table on September 18th, just sit down and talk with us. And, finally, he has agreed to do that tomorrow. But if you're reporting is to be believed, he's sort of going into it setting \u2013 reducing expectations improperly. He should be doing what presidents do and saying we're going to find a deal to keep the government of the greatest nation on earth open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it enough of a deal to say, take the short-term seven-week funding deal and we'll continue to talk about these health care subsidies that Democrats say they are so concerned about? I mean is it really worth the risk?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Here's \u2013 here's my thought about this, Margaret. This - - my personal view. We've got to solve this health care issue, and Republicans are saying the same thing. Mike Johnson has said it. Senator Cornyn has said it. Senator Hawley has said it. Senator Murkowski has said it. We're asking to fix a problem that even Republicans want to fix.",
      "I don't think we have to have every detail pinned down with all the i's dotted and t's crossed in order to do a short-term extension. But I do want to see that Republicans are saying, you're right, we can fix this, and here's the path to finding a fix.",
      "And the second thing we need, which is so reasonable, we're just asking, if we do a deal, please don't, Mr. President, sign the deal and then immediately the next day start \u2013 starting to take away funds, rescinding agreements that you just made yesterday. A deal should be a deal. And we should all agree that Americans should not see their health care suffer, their premiums spike, and people lose insurance and providers close.",
      "We've already had providers in Virginia announce that they are closing their doors because of the bill that the Republicans passed in July. And this is happening all over the country. Let's just do what's right by our constituents and fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you another question specific to Virginia, and that is what is going on inside the judicial system. Back in August it was the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, Todd Gilbert, who suddenly resigned. Then, earlier this month, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Eric Siebert, resigned after failing to bring a case against New York's Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "What is going on here in the Virginia court system?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, I \u2013 it's pretty darn plain. The president nominated two U.S. attorneys in Virginia, both with Republican bona fides. Todd Gilbert, in the western district, had been the Republican speaker of our house of delegates. He resigned as a legislator to take the Trump appointment. President Trump's team interviewed these candidates, approved the candidates, nominated the candidates, and then even appointed them into the interim position. But both were forced out because they said their integrity as prosecutors would not allow them to genuflect to Donald Trump.",
      "In Todd Gilbert's case they wanted to force him to demote a long time career member of the Western District of Virginia, who had served under multiple administrations and presidents. He refused to do so. And in Eric Siebert's case, he refused to bring a criminal charge against a perceived Trump political opponent when there was no evidence to support the charge.",
      "President Trump spending time going after enemies, trying to figure out a way to give $20 billion to a friend, the Argentine government, instead of dealing with the challenges we elected him to confront. Food prices are going up. Building supplies are going up. School supplies are going up. And energy costs are going up. Health care costs are going up. And Donald Trump seems to be focused on a retribution campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: You got to focus, man. This is an important job. It's time to focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when it comes to those Virginia cases, have you talked to Siebert, have you talked to Gilbert to understand why they felt they had to resign?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I have talked to each of them after the resignations were done. These were individuals \u2013 I knew both \u2013 I knew Todd Gilbert because of his legislative role and I knew Eric Siebert very well by reputation. And again, this was the prosecutor, Margaret, who, when the Biden administration transitioned to the Trump administration, the Trump administration DOJ put him in the role as an interim even before we recommended him, along with our Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, as you mentioned.",
      "So, after they had been fired, yes, I did call and say I'd like to understand why you were forced out. And they shared thoughts with me without getting into anything about particular cases or particular communication they'd had with Trump administration officials.",
      "But I am convinced, and Virginians are convinced \u2013 I traveled around the state this week, people are talking about this. Both of these individuals had a backbone. They wouldn't genuflect to Donald Trump and they wouldn't bring baseless cases. And we shouldn't see that in any district in this nation. And it's sad that President Trump is more focused on retribution than serving his constituents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that eastern district did come forward with this indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. Yes, it was just a two-page indictment. No evidence presented publicly here. But it was convincing enough to 14 of 23 people sitting on a grand jury. Can you really say there's no there there?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: A bare \u2013 a \u2013 well, a bare majority, as you know, Margaret, there's 23 people on a grand jury. They need at least 12 votes to get an indictment. And, yes, they got their finger over the bar with 14. Although the 23 wouldn't agree on one of the charges that the U.S. attorney was pushing. So, we will see what this case is about.",
      "It is odd that the indictment has so few facts. And I found it very odd. I used to practice in this court. And when the attorney general put out a press statement after the indictment and said, we will follow the facts in this case. What? Prosecutors follow the facts before they indict.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: They don't indict and then say, well, let's see what the facts are. I think she even revealed that this is a weak case, which everyone in her office was telling her it was a weak case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 on your Armed Services role I want to quickly ask you. You have said you are supportive of the creation of a Palestinian state.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we saw at the U.N. this past week a large number of members just simply walked out when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke. It was a statement. Tomorrow, he's going to be at the White House. Ahead of that meeting, President Trump said this.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There's been enough. It's time to stop now. OK?",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a strong statement. Do you know how the United States should enforce that? How do you force Israel to step back from annexation?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, I was very heartened that the president said that. And \u2013 and you're right, I support what the United States voted for in the U.N. in 1947, a state of Israel and a state of Palestine. One of those promises has been met. One hasn't. And we need to be on a path for a Palestinian state that's demilitarized where Hamas plays no role in its governance. And until we find that path forward, we're going to have continued cycles of violence that are bad for Israelis, bad for Palestinians, bad for the region.",
      "So, I hope the president, who by all accounts has a strong relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, makes plain that we are \u2013 we are against annexation and this 21-point proposal that the president has on the table, which is pretty similar to the New York dialogue being led by the French and the Saudis, they're \u2013 they're different efforts, but they're trying to reach the same point, a future state for Israel and Palestine where both can live in peace and creating stability in the region instead of the cycles of violence.",
      "So, I hope the president leans into that at the meeting tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: I was heartened by his comment. It would be a big mistake for the prime minister, Netanahu, to look at all of the nations that have been allies saying you need to change course and for him to just pull his head in the shell and turn inward and continue to isolate Israel rather than move forward toward peace and more stability in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Kaine, thank you for your insights today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Ty Cobb. He served as White House special counsel for just under a year during the first Trump administration, helping to coordinate the response to Robert Mueller's probe of Russian influence on the 2016 election.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "TY COBB (Former White House Special Counsel to the President): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw this action against former FBI Director James Comey this past week and he was indicted on two charges specific to his September 2020 testimony to Congress about Russian election meddling in 2016. The so-called crossfire hurricane.",
      "In your view, from what you've heard of this case, do you think it has enough substance to actually head to trial?",
      "TY COBB: I don't really. You know, as you and Senator Kaine discussed briefly moments ago, that the grand jury rejected one of the counts, the top count actually in the indictment, approved two, but by a very slim margin, 14 out of 23, in a process where there's no defense attorney in the room and the standard is merely probable cause. You know, the next courtroom that this will be assessed in, if it gets to trial, requires unanimity from 12 people, and \u2013 and there will be a vigorous defense. I don't see any way in the world that, you know, Comey would be convicted. And I think there's a good chance because of, you know, the wholly unconstitutional authoritarian way that this was done that the case may get tossed out well before trial.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wholly unconstitutional and authoritarian. That's \u2013 that's quite a description. You used to work for President Trump. What makes you now characterize his actions that way?",
      "TY COBB: That's true. I used to work \u2013 well, I used to work at the White House as \u2013 as a lawyer, you know, interacting with the Justice Department in the Mueller investigation and other matters. And I was not Trump's personal lawyer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "TY COBB: So, my role was really, you know, as a \u2013 as a government employee and not personal to the \u2013 to the president. He did have personal lawyers.",
      "But, you know, at the time, you know, I was trying to perform the duties that were assigned to me. In this \u2013 in this circumstance, you know, I'm eight years removed from that. I don't \u2013 I don't have any allegiances or reasons to, you know, say anything other than balls and strikes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TY COBB: And, you know, former Attorney General Jackson, Justice Jackson, Nuremberg prosecutor, himself highlighted in 1940 that the most important thing at the Justice Department, when he was attorney general, was that people not target individuals. That they merely pursue crimes. Griffin Bell, you know, years later, 1978, you know, said essentially the same thing, emphasized how, you know, political \u2013 politics and, you know, favor have no business at the Justice Department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TY COBB: It's all about even handedness. And I think we talked about the misrepresentations that Attorney General Bondi made about how she would proceed evenhandedly and, you know, she's wholly abandoned that now and is now merely doing the president's bidding when he says prosecute my enemies now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, \"The New York Times\" is reporting that half a dozen U.S. attorneys' offices have been ordered to draft plans to investigate a group funded by George Soros, who is a Democratic donor. You look at that, you look at the lists of names of others who the president has said he specifically wants to be prosecuted or investigated. I'll read a few of them to you. Two former Trump officials, Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor. He also said he wants a federal investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith. The DOJ fired the 35 lawyers who were involved in the January 6th and classified documents cases. The Justice Department is now going after Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis' travel records. We have quite an exhaustive list here. What is the pattern you see?",
      "TY COBB: Well, I think if you go to 30,000 feet, what you see is a lot of moving parts, but simple themes. The simple themes are rewriting history. Trump wants to rewrite history so that, you know, the next generation may not know that he incited a violent insurrection, refused to peacefully transfer the power of the presidency after losing an election, stole classified documents and showed them to, you know, friends and guests at Mar-a-Lago. You know, and that \u2013 that he was a criminal. I mean, he's a convicted felon. All \u2013 all anybody involved in those events that offended him, they're in \u2013 they're in real danger.",
      "So, you have the rewriting of history stuff. You know, the U.S. attorney that he appointed his personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, you know, her \u2013 her role previously in the administration was, you know, trying to eliminate the theory that, you know, America, you know, had slaves at the Smithsonian. She was there to, you know, whitewash the Smithsonian.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TY COBB: And paint America as \u2013 paint American as something that \u2013 that it isn't. I mean America needs to learn from the mistakes and lessons that we've had. And one of the biggest mistakes that \u2013 that America ever had was re-electing President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a number of Republican lawmakers are declining to speak out and are leaving the door open that these cases are legitimate. Do you think that the judicial system can resist what you are saying here as just simply politically motivated pressure?",
      "TY COBB: I think that's an excellent question. I think, you know, the founders, when they \u2013 when they drafted the Constitution, Article One is to Congress and Congress has the greatest powers under the Constitution. Spending power, war power, impeachment. Congress is really there to check the presidency.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "TY COBB: Congress has been neutered by the cowardice of the Republicans. Mike Johnson won't even seat \u2013 recently elected Representative Grijalva because he doesn't want her to tip the balance on the \u2013 on the Epstein vote.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "TY COBB: So, Congress is totally in the tank and the judiciary is doing \u2013 doing its best.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going \u2013 I'm going to have to put you off. I'm sorry.",
      "TY COBB: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to have to cut you off, I'm sorry, because we're out of time there.",
      "TY COBB: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ty Cobb, thank you for your time.",
      "We'll be right back.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump will meet with congressional leaders on Monday, just ahead of an Oct. 1 deadline for lawmakers to reach an agreement on a spending bill that would avert a government shutdown, multiple sources familiar with the plans told CBS News Saturday.",
      "Mr. Trump will meet with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the sources said.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump\u00a0said that he had canceled a meeting\u00a0with Schumer and Jeffries, calling their \"demands\" for the spending bill \"unserious and ridiculous.\"",
      "In a joint statement Saturday, Schumer and Jeffries said that Mr. Trump had \"once again agreed to a meeting in the Oval Office,\" and adding that they were \"resolute in our determination to avoid a government shutdown.\"",
      "With the deadline fast approaching, Schumer called Thune on Friday and urged him to get Mr. Trump to meet, an aide to Schumer told CBS News.",
      "Punchbowl was first to report the meeting.",
      "Lawmakers are facing a deadline of midnight Tuesday, when the 2026 fiscal year begins, to reach a deal on full-year spending bill, or a continuing resolution, which is a temporary stop-gap measure.",

    "summary": "The buyers of distressed brick-and-mortar companies like RadioShack and Modell's Sporting Goods, are accused of running a Ponzi scheme.",
    "story": [
      "A pair of e-commerce entrepreneurs who bought a number of well-known retail brands \u2014 including RadioShack, Modell's Sporting Goods and Pier 1 Imports \u2014 out of bankruptcy are accused of running a Ponzi scheme.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.",
      "Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens 'n Things were also among their acquisitions.",
      "REV acquired RadioShack in 2020, three years after the nearly century-old electronics chain filed for its second bankruptcy. RadioShack first filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2015. In 2023, Unicomer Group acquired RadioShack, and in 2024, relaunched it as an e-commerce platform. RadioShack's current owners are not named in the lawsuit.",
      "Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in March 2020, when it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports \u2014 which still exists as an online store \u2014 declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.",
      "The SEC's suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, \"made material misrepresentations\" to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were \"on fire\" and that \"cash flow is strong.\" They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be invested in that specific firm. That proved not to be the case, according to the SEC's lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "\"Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits,\" the suit states. \"Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations.\"",
      "Neither Mehr nor Lopez immediately responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The SEC alleges that at least $5.9 million of returns paid to investors were actually Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors, as opposed to companies' profits.",
      "Additionally, the federal regulatory agency claims that Mehr and Lopez allocated $16 million worth of investments for their own use, according to the filing.",
      "REV Chief Operating Officer Maya Burkenroad is also accused of aiding Lopez and Mehr's alleged crimes. On REV's website, Burkenroad, who is Lopez's cousin, was described as having \"over 10 years of experience managing multi-million-dollar companies,\" according to the complaint.",
      "But the SEC claims Lopez and Mehr misrepresented her experience. Before joining REV, she had worked as a substitute preschool teacher, a promoter at a radio station, and as an assistant to Lopez at a prior endeavor, the complaint alleges.",
      "Burkenroad didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "story": [
      "In a joint U.S.-Mexican operation last month, authorities tracked down a cartel leader accused of running a gruesome infant trafficking ring in northern Mexico, according to senior intelligence officials.",
      "Martha Alicia Mendez Aguilar, known as \"La Diabla,\" was captured on Sept. 2 after officials say the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, referred to by the U.S. as CJNG, lured a handful of pregnant women \u2014 often in vulnerable or impoverished circumstances \u2014 to remote areas. Once there, CJNG traffickers allegedly performed illegal cesarean operations on the women, killing the mothers and allegedly harvesting their organs postmortem, and placing newborns into illicit markets, according to senior intelligence officials. The infants were then sold to couples in the United States for as much as 250,000 pesos or roughly $14,000 each, according to the senior intelligence officials.",
      "Mexican authorities were tipped off by intelligence provided by the National Counterterrorism Center, under the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. NCTC Director Joe Kent called the scheme an \"example of what terrorist cartels will do to diversify their revenue streams and finance operations,\" in a statement provided to CBS News, crediting NCTC analysts with tracking Aguilar's patterns and locations, then coordinating with U.S. intelligence and Mexican partners on the ground.",
      "Senior intelligence officials say the arrest involved support from the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI El Paso, Diplomatic Security Service and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with Mexican law enforcement executing the operation alongside \"Fiscalia Especializada en la Mujer\" or the Special Prosecutor's Office for Women. Aguilar remains in Mexican custody, according to senior intelligence officials. The investigation into the alleged trafficking ring remains ongoing.",
      "The case underscores Washington's intensified targeting of Mexican cartels in recent years.",
      "In January, President Trump signed an executive order directing the State Department to designate cartels and transnational gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, or FTOs. The State Department in February announced the designation for eight gangs, including CJNG.",
      "The capture of \"La Diabla\" marks an expansion in the application of U.S. counterterrorism policy, with intelligence elements like NCTC now actively applying counterterrorism capabilities to target not only narcotraffickers, but also human trafficking rings and terroristic violence by groups like CJNG, notorious for brutal tactics and control over swaths of Mexico's territory.",
      "Under the new FTO framing, U.S. agencies wield more expansive tools, including intelligence, sanctions, and military support to track down the cartels and their affiliates, beyond reliance on traditional criminal prosecutions. Critics of the approach have warned of overreach and unintended consequences, while proponents argue that cartels increasingly function like hybrid terrorist groups to pick up territorial control and expand trafficking networks.",
      "According to NCTC, U.S. intelligence has added over 21,000 cartel members and associates into their classified terrorist database, creating over 35,000 identities related to the newly designated foreign terrorist organizations. Last month, the agency stated that 6,525 terrorists have been denied entry into the United States since the beginning of the Trump administration.",

      "At Kyiv's central train station, passengers arrived to the crackle of anti-aircraft gunfire and the low buzz of attack drones. Mostly women, they waited quietly in a platform underpass until the air raid alert ended. Parents checked the news on their phones while children played online games.",
      "\"The sky has turned black again,\" said one woman at the station, who gave only her first name, Erika. \"It's happening a lot.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Robert Costa that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. We have breaking news as we begin what is likely to be another turbulent week here in Washington. Congress faces a government shutdown deadline of October 1. Our Robert Costa spoke this morning to President Trump. Bob, top leaders, both parties, both sides of the Capitol, are coming to the White House. Did the President tell you he thinks a shutdown can be avoided?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: A shutdown looks likely at this point based on my conversation this morning with President Trump. He says both sides are at a stalemate. Democrats want to extend health care subsidies that were part of the Affordable Care Act, but President Trump said his focus on health care is on preventing undocumented migrants from having access to any of the U.S. health care system. Now, it's illegal for any non-citizen to have that sort of access, but President Trump says we're not going to have it. Quote, we're not going to allow it, in terms of moving forward on any discussion, unless the Democrats come to his side on health care and don't focus on the subsidies. But based on my conversations with top Democrats, that's not going to happen. So President Trump told me quote, I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue. That makes a shutdown quite likely. And inside the White House, sources are saying President Trump actually welcomes a shutdown in the sense that he believes he can wield executive power to get rid of what he calls waste, fraud and abuse. And there is that memo, as you mentioned, that says the government is ready to have mass firings if a deal isn't struck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Reductions in force, right. Well, we also know that the President took some extraordinary public statements in the past few days. He publicly said he wants to see Adam Schiff, now a senator, Letitia James prosecuted along with James Comey, the former FBI director who is now indicted. Yesterday, he twice posted on social media about former FBI Director Chris Wray. Did the President tell you, is he planning prosecutions?",
      "COSTA: I did not speak directly to the president about that today. But fishing around all weekend in his inner circle, it's clear, this is just the beginning in terms of possible prosecutions of those who have scrutinized the president or criticized him over the years. You mentioned the mortgage policy, potentially, of Senator Adam Schiff of California. He's being discussed inside of the Trump administration. So is Letitia James, the New York Attorney General, who sued the president over how he valued his real estate holdings. And there are others not even on our radar at this moment, like retired Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, who are being discussed as people who have, may have taken action against the administration or president in some way, allegedly, in the views of those inside. And they want to see the Justice Department hold them to account. There's such a gap right now in Washington. Republicans believe what President Trump is doing is accountability. Democrats are alarmed and see this as authoritarian government at work. And there's a real tension there that's not going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And a justice system that has to deal with evidence and facts.",
      "And we're going to talk about all of this ahead with some of our guests. Robert Costa, thank you very much for your reporting."

      "The ministry said in a statement that it had \"several capacities deployed\" after drone sightings from Saturday into Sunday night. It didn't offer any further details about the specifics of the deployment, the number of drones or locations.",
      "This is the latest unexplained drone activity after several sightings, including over five Danish airports last week, raising concerns about security in northern Europe amid suspected growing Russian aggression.",
      "Following a NATO meeting in Riga, Latvia, on Saturday, Col. Martin O'Donnell, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe spokesperson, announced that \"we will conduct even more enhanced vigilance with new multi-domain assets in the Baltic Sea region, which includes Denmark, under Baltic Sentry.\"",
      "He also said that NATO leaders were in constant contact with Danish officials following the drone sightings.",

      "Sweden had already announced earlier that it would \"lend Denmark a military anti-drone capability\" without giving further details.",
      "Tensions have been running high in Denmark in recent days following reports of drone activity, and hundreds of possible sightings reported by concerned citizens that couldn't officially be confirmed. Nonetheless, the public has been asked to report all suspicious activity to the police.",
      "Danish Minister of Justice Peter Hummelgaard said on Sept. 25 that the goal of the flyovers is to sow fear and division, adding that the country will seek additional ways to neutralize drones, including proposing legislation to allow infrastructure owners to shoot them down.",
      "It's not clear who is responsible for the drone activity. Danish authorities have not named the exact military locations where they have been seen.",
      "Drone sightings on Friday night took place at around 8:15 p.m. local time in Denmark and lasted for several hours, an officer on duty told AFP. The officer, Simon Skelsjaer, said police ad not shot down the drones and could not comment on their origins as police were working with the Danish military in their investigation into the incident, AFP reported.",
      "Danish authorities said sightings on Thursday appeared to be a \"hybrid attack,\" but they noted that there was no evidence indicating Moscow had orchestrated it, reported CBS partner BBC News.

No,\" he said, asking whether NATO would shoot down his helicopter when flying close to the Polish border.",
      "The release of Lukashenko's comments came after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that his nation doesn't intend to attack Europe, but will mount a \"decisive response\" to any aggression.",
      "\"I think people will very much regret if they commit the most flagrant violation of our territorial integrity and territorial sovereignty,\" Lavrov said, including \"attempts to shoot down \u2026 any object in general over our territory, in our airspace.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw this action against former FBI Director James Comey this past week, and he was indicted on two charges specific to his September 2020 testimony to Congress about Russian election meddling in 2016, so-called Crossfire Hurricane. In your view, from what you've heard of this case, do you think it has enough substance to actually head to trial?",
      "COBB: I don't, really. You know, as you and Senator Kaine discussed briefly, moments ago, that the grand jury rejected one of the counts, the top count, actually, in the indictment, approved two, but by a very slim margin, 14 out of 23 in a process where there's no defense attorney in the room, and the standard is merely probable cause. The next courtroom that this will be assessed in, if it gets to trial, requires unanimity from 12 people, and there will be a vigorous defense. I don't see any way in the world that, you know, Comey will be convicted. And I think there's a good chance, because of, you know, the wholly unconstitutional, authoritarian way that this was done, that the case may get tossed out well before trial.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wholly unconstitutional and authoritarian. That's- that's quite a description. You used to work for President Trump. What makes you now characterized his actions that way?",
      "COBB: I used to work- well, I used to work at the White House as as a lawyer, you know, interacting with the Justice Department in the Mueller investigation and other matters, and I was not Trump's personal lawyer. So, my role was really, you know, as a- as a government employee, and not personal to the- to the president. He did have personal lawyers, but, you know, at the time, you know, I was trying to perform the duties that were assigned to me. In this- in this circumstance, you know, I'm eight years removed from that. I don't- I don't have any allegiances or reasons to, you know, say anything other than balls and strikes. And former Attorney General Jackson, Justice Jackson, Nuremberg Prosecutor, himself, highlighted in 1940 that the most important thing at the Justice Department when he was Attorney General was that people not target individuals, that they merely pursue crimes. Griffin Bell, years later, 1978 said essentially the same thing. Emphasized how political- politics and favor have no business at the Justice Department. It's all about even-handedness. And I think we talked about the misrepresentations that Attorney General Bondi made about how she would proceed even-handedly, and, you know, she's wholly abandoned that and is now merely doing the President's bidding when he says, prosecute my enemies, now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Well, the New York Times is reporting that half a dozen US Attorney's Offices have been ordered to draft plans to investigate a group funded by George Soros, who is a democratic donor. You look at that, you look at the list of names of others who the President has said he specifically wants to be prosecuted or investigated. I'll read a few of them to you: Two former Trump officials, Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor. He also said he wants a federal investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith, the DOJ fired the 35 lawyers who were involved in the January 6th and classified documents cases. The Justice Department is now going after Fulton County DA Fani Willis' travel records. We have quite an exhaustive list here. What is the pattern you see?",
      "COBB: Well, I think if you go to 30,000 feet, what you see is a lot of moving parts, but simple themes. The simple themes are rewriting history. Trump wants to rewrite history so that, you know, the next generation may not know that he incited a violent insurrection, refused to peacefully transfer the power of the presidency after losing an election, stole classified documents and showed them to friends and- and guests at Mar-a-Lago, you know, and that he was a criminal. I mean, he's a convicted felon. All- all anybody involved in those events that offended him, they're- they're in real danger. So, you have the rewriting history stuff. You know, the US attorney that he appointed, his personal lawyer, Lindsay Halligan. You know her, her role previously in the administration was, you know, trying to eliminate the theory that, you know, America had slaves at the Smithsonian. She was there to, you know, whitewash the- the Smithsonian and paint America- paint America is something that- that it isn't. I mean, America needs to learn from the mistakes and lessons that we've had, and one of the biggest mistakes that- that America ever had was re-electing President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a number of Republican lawmakers are declining to speak out and are leaving the door open that these cases are legitimate. Do you think that the judicial system can resist what you are saying here as just simply politically motivated pressure?",
      "COBB: I think that's an excellent question. I think, you know, the founders, when they- when they drafted the Constitution, Article One is to Congress, and Congress has the greatest powers under the Constitution; spending power, war power, impeachment. Congress is really there to check the presidency. Congress has been neutered by the cowardice of the Republicans. Mike Johnson won't even seat recently elected representative Grijalva because he doesn't want her to tip the balance on the- on the Epstein vote. Congress is totally in the tank and --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, I'm gonna have to cut you off. I'm sorry, because we're out of time there. Ty Cobb, thank you for your time. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Good morning. Good to have you here in person.",
      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thanks. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about Ukraine, which you just returned from, but before I do that, let's button up where we left the conversation with Senator Klobuchar. FBI Director Chris Wray was twice spoken about in public statements by the President yesterday, and he said he has some explaining to do. He seemed to be connecting it to the FBI and January 6th. Are you at all concerned by the former director's actions?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I do think that there- you know, with this new information, there's going to have to be some explaining as to what 6th- what is this new information, and how does this relate to January?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, the number of the agents? That 274 --",
      "REP. TURNER: Yes. This does seem to be significantly different than what anyone has heard before, and how does this relate to the circumstances of what occurred there. Certainly, Kash Patel, as he's bringing this forward, this is going to be information that I think does relate. It really does go to everyone's confidence of what we currently know about that day. There's been a number of investigations, and a number of people who've looked at this. You know, this certainly is concerning. And I think you know it is better --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what part is concerning, because that inspector general report said months ago that there were several 100 FBI agents who responded after the Capitol Police asked him to be there?",
      "REP. TURNER: But it's the issue of, you know, what was- what- what was their role? What did they do? You know, that aspect, I think certainly. As we look at this information, as the FBI looks at the information, is it the same? Is it the same information that has been looked at before, or is it different? And that certainly bears review, and that, I think, will occur.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when the President says Chris Wray has some explaining to do, how do you interpret that? Because the Inspector General report is public. Kash Patel said those individuals were there. It's not standard to send them, but it was disclosed they were there at the Capitol.",
      "REP. TURNER: I mean, obviously, the current FBI Director, and the FBI is going to have to come forward with the information. That information will be reviewed, and then, ultimately, the FBI is going to have to- and I think that the prior director will have to explain how this information relates to what we've looked at before. And it's either going to be the same and prove that it is as everyone believed the circumstances were before, or it's going to be different. And, at that point, we're going to have to look at, you know, how does it relate to what we believe we knew, and how does it relate to what we now see, what we don't know. Because I have no information, I think no one else has any additional information besides what the news reports are, and we'll have to review what that information is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to be very clear, because it is such a dangerous information environment in so many ways, you are not in any way suggesting that the FBI was secretly agitating, which is what the president said the attack on January 6th?",
      "REP. TURNER: I'm not suggesting anything, and I don't think you are either. I think what we're both suggesting is that this currently is in news reports, and those news reports certainly bear a review of the information that's going to come forward, and that information is either going to tell us that it's the same information that has been seen before, or it's going to be new information. And if it's new information that's going to need to be reviewed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, and I want to talk about your trip to Ukraine on the other side of it, but I have to do this right now. So stay with us, all of you.",
      "((COMMERCIAL BREAK))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return now to our conversation with Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Congressman, we were showing video there earlier of the overnight attack Russia carried out against Ukraine. You were just there, in Kyiv. I'm sure you welcomed what the President said this week, when he said he now has changed his mind, and he does believe Ukraine could win this war and get its territory back from Russia. But he also added he wishes everyone well when he made that statement. So is he telling us that the United States is walking away from Ukraine and leaving it up to them, or is he signaling that the United States is going to help Ukraine win that territory back?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, we definitely need to help. And this is part of the dirty secret that really where the United States really needs to step it up, and it's part of the meeting that he had with the president of the EU Commission. You know, the United States is providing aid to Ukraine. But, at the same time, the West, the EU, and the United States is subsidizing Russia and its production machine, because, you know, we're buying from China and India that is buying energy from Russia, and the EU is buying energy from Russia. So we need to place sanctions on Russia so that we're not funding their economy, which is funding their ability to attack and kill Ukraine. So we're funding both sides of this. Unfortunate- unfortunately, there are those in Congress that want to stop supporting Ukraine's ability to defend themselves. Well, that'll just result in more attacks from Russia, as we saw last night, against Ukraine. That's not going to get us to peace. The only way to get us to peace, and Trump's vision of peace, is to impact their ability for production, to stop subsidizing Russia's economy and their ability for production and killing Ukrainians, and that's to adopt Lindsey Graham and Brian Fitzpatrick's bill that would impose sanctions. Give the President the ability to impact Russia's ability to wage this war and get us to peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Speaker Johnson has said before that he would put that bill to a vote, he just hasn't. And he has said, oh, I need the president to green light it. That's not true. He has a veto-proof majority. We've had Senator Graham on this program a million times telling us this is set to go, just give us the green light. Did Speaker Johnson respond to your request to move?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, and he's- the momentum is here, we need to do this now. The President doesn't need to give us a green light. He's not a red light. The last time that- and we and we're coming back, and we need to do so, we need to do so now. The last time we put on the floor the bill that would have stopped funding Ukraine, over 300 members voted for it. If we put the bill on the floor to stop the- to put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their economy, it would be similar. Over 300 members would vote for it. The only way to peace is to put sanctions on Russia, continue our support for Ukraine, which is what we're doing, what the President is going to be doing, and bring this war to an end. Support Trump's vision of peace. Put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their- their war economy. Now, what I saw in Ukraine, which is what's really incredible, is that they are winning modern warfare. What they're doing with their anti-drone technology, I mean, they are really the tech bros of the future. They are implementing on the front line, anti-drone air defense technology that is winning this war with our help and assistance, which they're going to continue to need for the long-range systems that Russia is bringing in and that are attacking Kyiv with. But what their anti-drone technology that no one else has, that they are implementing. They are winning this war. We need to be on the side of that war of the future that they're winning and support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I've heard military officials explain this to me that this is like a really interesting test case to learn the lessons that Ukraine is illustrating for the world. However, in the immediate term, will the President lift restrictions on Ukraine's ability to use long-range weapons to actually attack Russia?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, and he really needs to do so, because what's happening with that pressure that's on the front line \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he has the old Biden policy.",
      "REP. TURNER: Right, well, he does, and that's what he needs to release, because with the pressure on the front line and the fact that Ukraine has developed anti-drone technology, where they're taking down Russian drones, they're using their own drones to attack Russia, but Russia has long-range weapons that they're attacking that front line. Ukraine needs to have the ability to use long-range weapons to push Russia back. And when they're able to do that, they will get their territory back. If they are able to do that, they will win this war. And if we put sanctions on Russia, impacting their ability to produce their war machine and production, they will be able to win this modern warfare, and will be on the right side of what- this is not old-time war. This is modern war, and we're being on the right side of Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've just got to persuade President Trump to do that- that change in policy. When we were in France last week speaking to President Macron, I asked him about those incursions into European airspace, some would say by Russian drones or Russian jets, others have said they still need to investigate. We've seen drones or jets into Poland, Estonia, Romania, Norway, possibly Denmark. What should the United States be doing to push back on those provocations?",
      "REP. TURNER: You know, what's interesting about this is it? What we've always said is that, you know, Russia, once they got through Ukraine, would be testing and go- can continue into Europe. But what they're seeing- but what they're seeing now, because they're having this- this success of Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine. They're now going into Poland and Romania, and they're seeing that Poland and Romania don't have the advanced technology that Ukraine does, and instead of going through Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine since- since this is Modern Warfare, and Ukraine is winning it, they're seeing that the old war is actually old Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike Turner, thank you for sharing some of your insights, what you learned on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "REP TURNER: Thank you,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back in a moment. So stay with us."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who joins us this morning from Richmond. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have what, 140,000 federal civilian workers in your state, one of the highest numbers in the nation. How concerned are you that you will see mass layoffs if we go into the shutdown that the White House says they are preparing for?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, and I think your reporter Robert Costa said they're even welcoming it. We are really worried about it, Margaret. When Ted Cruz forced a shutdown of the government in October 2013, it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And when Donald Trump forced a shutdown of the government in late 2018, early 2019 it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And this one would be the same. The only thing about the President's threat to fire more people is he's already doing it, and instead of threatening, he should just be meeting to negotiate. We came near shut down deadlines during the Biden administration, but we never shut government down because the President would sit down with congressional leaders of both parties and would find a path forward. And that's what we've been asking for since the Democrats put an alternate plan on the table on September 18, just sit down and talk with us, and finally, he has agreed to do that tomorrow. But if you're reporting, is to be believed, he's sort of going into it, setting reducing expectations improperly. He should be doing what presidents do and saying, we're going to find a deal to keep the government of the greatest nation on earth open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it enough of a deal to say, take the short term, seven week funding deal, and we'll continue to talk about these health care subsidies that Democrats say they are so concerned about. I mean, is it really worth the risk?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Here's, here's my thought about this, Margaret. And this is my personal view. We've got to solve this health care issue. And Republicans are saying the same thing. Mike Johnson has said it. Senator Cornyn has said it, Senator Hawley has said it. Senator Murkowski has said it. We're asking to fix a problem that even Republicans want to fix. I don't think we have to have every detail pinned down with all the Is dotted and Ts crossed in order to do a short term extension, but I do want to see that Republicans are saying, You're right. We can fix this, and here's the path to finding a fix. And the second thing we need, which is so reasonable, we're just asking, if we do a deal, please don't, Mr. President, sign the deal, and then immediately the next day start, starting to take away funds, rescinding agreements that you just made yesterday. A deal should be a deal, and we should all agree that Americans should not see their health care suffer, their premiums spike, and people lose insurance and providers close. We've already had providers in Virginia announce that they are closing their doors because of the bill that the Republicans passed in July, and this is happening all over the country. Let's just do what's right by our constituents and fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you another question specific to Virginia, and that is, what is going on inside the judicial system. Back in August, it was the US Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, Todd Gilbert, who suddenly resigned. Then earlier this month, the US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Eric Siebert resigned after failing to bring a case against New York's Attorney General, Letitia James. What is going on here in the Virginia court system? Margaret?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: It's pretty darn plain the President nominated two U.S. attorneys in Virginia, both with Republican bona fides. Todd Gilbert in the Western District, had been the Republican Speaker of our house of delegates. He resigned as a legislator to take the Trump appointment. President Trump's team interviewed these candidates, approved the candidates, nominated the candidates, and then even appointed them into the interim position. But both were forced out because they said their integrity as prosecutors would not allow them to genuflect to Donald Trump. And in Todd Gilbert's case, they wanted to force him to demote a long time career member of the Western District of Virginia who had served under multiple administrations and presidents. He refused to do so. And in Eric Siebert's case, he refused to bring a criminal charge against a perceived Trump political opponent when there was no evidence to support the charge. President Trump is spending time going after enemies, trying to figure out a way to give $20 billion to a friend, the Argentine Government, instead of dealing with the challenges we elected him to confront. Food prices are going up. Building supplies are going up. School supplies are going up. Energy costs are going up, health care costs are going up, and Donald Trump seems to be focused on a retribution campaign. You got to focus, man, this is an important job. It's time to focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to those Virginia cases, have you talked to Siebert, have you talked to Gilbert to understand why they felt they had to resign?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: I have talked to each of them after the resignations were done. These were individuals I knew both. I knew Todd Gilbert because of his legislative role, and I knew Eric Siebert very well by reputation. And again, this was the prosecutor Margaret, who, when the Biden administration transitioned to the Trump administration, the Trump administration DOJ put him in the role as an interim even before we recommended him, along with our republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, as you mentioned. So after they had been fired, yes, I did call and say I'd like to understand why you were forced out, and they shared thoughts with me without getting into anything about particular cases or particular communication they'd had with Trump administration officials. But I am convinced, and Virginians are convinced. I traveled around the state this week. People are talking about this. Both of these individuals had a backbone. They wouldn't genuflect to Donald Trump, and they wouldn't bring baseless cases, and we shouldn't see that in any district in this nation. And it's sad that President Trump is more focused on retribution than serving his constituents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that Eastern District did come forward with this, this indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. Yes, it was just a two page indictment, no evidence presented publicly here, but it was convincing enough to 14 of 23 people sitting on a grand jury. Can you really say there's no there there?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, a bare majority, as you know, Margaret, there's 23 people on a grand jury. They need at least 12 votes to get an indictment, and yes, they got their finger over the bar with 14, although the four- the 23 wouldn't agree on one of the charges that the US attorney was pushing. So we will see what this case is about. It is odd that the indictment has so few facts, and I found it very odd. I used to practice in this court, and when the Attorney General put out a press statement after the indictment and said, we will follow the facts in this case. What prosecutors follow the facts before they indict, they don't indict, and then say, well, let's see what the facts are. I think she even revealed that this is a weak case, which everyone in her office was telling her it was a weak case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You in your armed services role. I want to quickly ask you, you have said you are supportive of the creation of a Palestinian state, and we saw at the UN this past week, a large number of members just simply walked out when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke, it was a statement tomorrow he's going to be at the White House ahead of that meeting, President Trump said this:",
      "VO SOT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There's been enough. It's time to stop now, okay?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a strong statement. Do you know how the United States should enforce that? How do you force Israel to step back from annexation?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, I was very heartened that the President said that, and you're right. I support what the United States voted for in the UN in 1947 a state of Israel and a state of Palestine. One of those promises has been met. One hasn't, and we need to be on a path for a Palestinian state that's demilitarized, where Hamas plays no role in its governance. And until we find that path forward, we're going to have continued cycles of violence that are bad for Israelis, bad for Palestinians, bad for the region. So I hope the president, who, by all accounts, has a strong relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu, makes plain that we are, we are against annexation, and this 21 point proposal that the President has on the table, which is pretty similar to the New York dialog being led by the French and the Saudis. They're different efforts, but they're trying to reach the same point, a future state for Israel and Palestine, where both can live in peace, and creating stability in the region instead of the cycles of violence. So I hope the president leans into that at the meeting tomorrow. I was heartened by his comment. It would be a big mistake for the Prime Minister Netanyahu to look at all of these nations that have been allies, saying you need to change course, and for him to just pull his head in the shell and turn inward and continue to isolate Israel, rather than move forward toward peace and more stability in the region.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we just heard from my colleague, Robert Costa that the President indicated to him the likelihood of a shutdown, and with that, potentially mass firings. Do you think this is posturing, or do you worry your fellow Democrats are walking into a trap?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I am glad the president has finally agreed to meet with the leadership in Congress. He canceled the meeting last week, which I think was a big mistake, because this is an opportunity for the country because of one big problem. And that is that the Republicans have created a health care crisis. My constituents, Americans are standing on a cliff right now with these insurance premium increases that are upon them. So Democrats are united in pushing on this and saying, look, let us do something about this crisis before it is too late. Seventy five percent increase in premiums starting November 1, on people who are small business owners, people who are farmers out there, twice as much in the rural areas. So that's what this is about to us, and the President prides himself in the art of a deal, this is the moment for him to meet with Democrats and come to an agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So those premiums go up November 1. You're talking about the extension of the health care subsidies, but insurance companies plan that year out, so these premiums are already priced in here. Why not agree to--",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --Margaret, what we know is that these tax--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --government--",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --If I could just, okay, go ahead, the tax credits are what really could make a difference here for people, because of the fact that we know these premiums hit November 1. Getting this done now is a now thing. It's not a December thing. It's not a January thing. It's not an off ramp. It is something we have to get done now. As one of my farmers that I met with out in rural Minnesota said, when looking at the President's tariffs and looking at what's happened in farm country, five-year high in small farm bankruptcy, he said it's a perfect storm of ugly. That's where we are with the economy right now. And that's why we are pushing on what is one of the biggest cost drivers for Americans, in addition to groceries and electricity prices going up, it's health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, you couldn't take the seven week funding and then negotiate that, you're saying it has to be agreed to right now.",

KLOBUCHAR: We believe this is a now problem, and while we are eager to talk with Senator Thune, I know Senator Schumer is to get this moving, in the end, we know that they are rubber stamped for what the President wants. Not everyone is like Rand Paul going off in his own direction and talking about the debt out of the \"Big, Beautiful Bill.\" I don't agree with a lot of what he says, but he's right about that debt. He's right about what happened with that bill, most of them are just going to rubber stamp what President Trump says. That's why it was so important to get this meeting, and I hope he sees it, not as the president, not as political theater, but as real people who are facing a crisis right now, whether it's in the cities, the suburbs or the rural areas of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sit on the Judiciary Committee. So I want to ask you about what's happening right now. Earlier this month, the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert resigned after failing to bring a case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. We just spoke about her with Robert Costa. Monday, Lindsey Halligan was sworn in as the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. She has never prosecuted a case before. Three days into this new job, she moved forward with the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on two counts. Have you spoken to your fellow Republicans on the Judiciary Committee? Do they have concerns about what's happening in Virginia?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Well, I plan on doing that this week. And what I see, this as a former prosecutor myself, this is weaponizing the Justice Department, basically taking a career prosecutor who was recommended by the Republican governor of the state of Virginia, clearly has Republican roots, who made a decision based on the evidence over a period of months, made a decision. Then he's pushed out, forced out, so that the President can install his own aid into the job. When I questioned Attorney General Bondi during her confirmation hearing, she assured me that politics would not play a role that they would make independent decisions. That is not what this is. This is a vengeance prosecution. It is not about the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You also worked on investigating January 6, 2021, and the attack of the United States Capitol. FBI director, Kash Patel. Yesterday said publicly 274 FBI agents were quote, \"thrown into crowd control on that day against FBI standards.\" President Trump also said publicly that FBI agents acted as agitators who were secretly placed against all rules, regulations, protocols and standards into the crowd prior to and during the attack. This contradicts what the Inspector General said in a published report that said there was no evidence of undercover employees in the crowd, and that there were hundreds of special agents and employees who came in after the Capitol Hill police asked for them. This is now newly in focus, because the President put the focus there, what was the role of the FBI that day?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I chaired the investigation of the security problems, along a bipartisan investigation with Senator Peters and then Senator Blunt and Senator Portman. This went on. We had a number of open hearings, and we made major, major recommendations for changes at the Capitol and nowhere was it found that the FBI was acting as agitators. In fact, they were called in when there was such a delay in bringing in the military to insist- to assist in what was essentially an insurrection, where over 100 police officers were injured or maimed because of this criminal activity at the Capitol. So I just find it appalling that the President would say that the FBI was somehow part of this. Kash Patel did clarify that in fact, they were brought in after the fact, but they were brought in because we needed help. Senators, Republicans and Democrats were calling the military leaders. They were calling the Attorney General. They were asking for help because that help was not coming to the Capitol. And everyone has seen those facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your insight there. We'll be watching what happens here, as the President tweeted both of those things, and in reference to former director Chris Wray, we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to start on that news you just heard, that the President is basically expecting a shutdown and possibly to carry out these mass layoffs. Do you think all of this is just a threat to make Democrats fold?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, I think both sides have to look at the proposals for spending and decide, you know, what is the best way forward for the country. The Republican proposal adds about $2 trillion in debt over the next year, so it'll be short $2 trillion. So I oppose the Republican plan because it adds debt. The Democrat plan would add $3 trillion in debt. So really, both plans are laden with deficit spending, and I think that's the biggest problem that our country faces. So I've actually proposed an alternative. I proposed a penny plan, which would cut a little bit across the board, and my plan would balance over about five years, we got a vote on mine last week, and 36 Republicans supported it, 16 didn't and no Democrats did. So my plan didn't pass either, but the plan that I would support would be a plan that reduces spending and reduces deficit spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we have this immediate deadline, though, of this week, and we know leaders are going to the White House. If we end up in this shutdown. Do you think it is appropriate and illegal for the executive to carry out the kind of mass firings that the budget director laid out in that memo this past week?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, there's been several cases adjudicated now all the way to the Supreme Court, and the President seems to have won every one of them on his ability to hire and fire within the executive branch. And I think this is understandable, because in the executive branch if the president can't fire him, who can? and so I think the President has a great out",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Without consulting congress?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Over executive branch employees- for hiring and firing people in the executive branch? I think he has a great deal of leeway. The court has upheld this repeatedly, and so I suspect they will, even when Congress- you know, the Democrats try to protect this agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Board, and they say, well, the funding will come from the Fed. You won't get to vote on the funding, and the person hired can't be fired. Well, he did fire that person in 2020 and the courts upheld that in 2021, in the Supreme Court, and really since then, every case he has won. And as you know, I'm a equal parts critic of both Republicans and Democrats. I've criticized Trump on things, but the one thing is on the hiring and firing. I think he's going to win every one of those cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your role in Homeland Security. You are chairman of that oversight committee. The President announced yesterday, and I'm sure you saw his social media post, that he's going to send troops to Portland, Oregon. He called it a 'war ravaged' city. He said he's also going to send troops to any immigration facilities around the country which are, quote, 'under siege from attack by antifa, and other domestic terrorists.' End quote. He said he's authorizing full force if necessary. Do you know what full force means here? Do you know what's in store?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think he has the legal authority to send troops to protect federal buildings and federal proceedings such as courts, and that's been around since Civil Rights Era. We've acknowledged that the federal government will sometimes come in despite what states say. I do think it's better when the states agree to it. For example, I mean, in Chicago- Chicago is a nightmare. It is literally a war zone, and the people being hurt, the worst are those who are poor and living in these communities. I've been to the most dangerous precinct in Chicago, and it's just despair and sadness and these young boys are growing up with no families\u2013",
      "[CROSSTALK STARTS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you haven't been briefed on the plans for Oregon?",
      "SEN. PAUL: There's no restaurants, no drugs- excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you haven't been briefed on plans to send troops to Oregon?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Not for Portland, no.",
      "[CROSSTALK ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because we have not yet seen troops in Chicago, though you're referencing the President's past threats to do so. In Oregon, the governor said there's no need, and they don't want these troops, but the mayor said- the mayor of Portland, federal agents have been arriving along with some armored vehicles. Are you comfortable with pushing the limits here of some of these uses of either potentially troops or federal agents.",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think both the people in Portland and across America have to decide about this. You know, we had anarchy in Portland for like, six months or a year. The city didn't even control large swaths of the city. These had federal buildings on them, and so I think there is a role for the federal government. Am I excited about it? No. I'd prefer not to have troops in our cities, or I'd prefer them only to come, you know, with the acceptance of the local authorities. But I do think there is a role if the states will not step up. Portland did not step up, and they let their city go, you know, they let it burn for goodness sakes, and then they let a whole area become the city, you know, these blocks of anarchy where some sort of local thug rule was a- was- was going on. So I don't know, I think ultimately what's going to happen. And I think some of this is the President showing the politics of Republicans versus Democrats is eventually cities like Chicago and Portland are going to give up on Democrats because their people are dying. It's their people in their community. The people have been supporting the Democrat party for decade after decade. They are the ones dying. It's not the people in the rich neighborhoods that are country club Republican, it's the poor people in every city is dying. Well, you know the cities have to step up on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm asking about your oversight role, because it seemed like the President's statement yesterday, it took a turn. It wasn't how he talked about Chicago. In fact, when he was speaking in this social media post about Portland, he used language here about domestic terrorists. And we know just a few days ago, the President did issue that executive order saying he wanted to declare this anti fascist group, antifa, to be a domestic terrorist organization. Have you seen evidence that these left wing activists are now becoming a more organized group with national leadership, something the FBI has said in the past, that they're really more of an ideology?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think you lose the description as activists once you start wielding weapons, and you show up with helmets and you're breaking windows. That's what was going on apparently in Portland, at the ICE building. I do think, though, that it's important when people start talking about labeling people, that we realize everybody, the worst among us, even those accused of heinous crimes, will get due process. So we can't single out a group and say, oh, they're not going to get due process because we're calling them terrorists. So I'd be careful of the labels, but I'm absolutely for going after the people wielding clubs and sticks and fighting with the police and trying to get into the federal buildings. They have to be punished, and they will be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you have concerns about designating groups with these anti-government sentiments as domestic terrorist groups. I mean, do you start worrying about Fourth Amendment violations?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I don't know that it's helpful to label groups, particularly since antifa, there are some real people in antifa, they're real violent people, but it is an amorphous group in the sense that I don't think they have a president, they don't have a local chapter. It is more an ideology. And it was useful, maybe around the world, to call things terrorism. But there's different rules of engagement. When we have to go after terrorist in the Middle East, we send- we send a Hellfire missile or a drone, often. In the United States, it's much tricker to be a police. I have a great deal of respect for our police because you're right. They have to respect the Fourth Amendment, the First Amendment, and so we have to be careful with labels, but that doesn't mean we should go soft on antifa and these people that are committing violence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator Rand Paul, thank you for your time this morning, 'Face the Nation' will be back in a minute. Stay with us."

    "published": "Sat, 27 Sep 2025 22:53:48 -0400",
    "summary": "The sanctions will again freeze Iranian assets abroad, halt arms deals with Tehran, and penalize any development of Iran's ballistic missile program, among other measures.",
    "story": [
      "The United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran early Sunday over its nuclear program, further squeezing the Islamic Republic as its people increasingly find themselves priced out of the food they need to survive and worried about their futures.",
      "The sanctions will again freeze Iranian assets abroad, halt arms deals with Tehran, and penalize any development of Iran's ballistic missile program, among other measures. It came via a mechanism known as \"snapback,\" included in Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, and comes as Iran's economy already is reeling.",
      "Iran's rial currency sits at a record low, increasing pressure on food prices and making daily life that much more challenging. That includes meat, rice and other staples of the Iranian dinner table.",
      "Meanwhile, people worry about a new round of fighting between Iran and Israel \u2014 as well as potentially the U.S. \u2014 as missile sites struck during the 12-day war in June now appear to be being rebuilt.",
      "Activists fear a rising wave of repression within the Islamic Republic, which already has reportedly executed more people this year than over the past three decades.",
      "Sina, the father of a 12-year-old boy who spoke on condition that only his first name be used for fear of repercussions, said the country has never faced such a challenging time, even during the deprivations of the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and the decades of sanctions that came later.",
      "\"For as long as I can remember, we've been struggling with economic hardship, and every year it's worse than the last,\" Sina told The Associated Press. \"For my generation, it's always either too late or too early \u2014 our dreams are slipping away.\"",
      "Snapback was designed to be veto-proof at the U.N. Security Council, meaning China and Russia could not stop it alone, as they have other proposed actions against Tehran in the past. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called them a \"trap\" for Iran on Saturday.",
      "France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered snapback over Iran 30 days ago for its further restricting monitoring of its nuclear program and the deadlock over its negotiations with the U.S.",
      "Iran further withdrew from the International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring after Israel's war with the country in June, which also saw the U.S. strike nuclear sites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, the country still maintains a stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% purity \u2014 a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90% \u2014 that is largely enough to make several atomic bombs, should Tehran choose to rush toward weaponization.",
      "Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and IAEA say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003.",
      "The three European nations on Sunday said they \"continuously made every effort to avoid triggering snapback.\" But Iran \"has not authorized IAEA inspectors to regain access to Iran's nuclear sites, nor has it produced and transmitted to the IAEA a report accounting for its stockpile of high-enriched uranium.\"",
      "Tehran has further argued that the three European nations shouldn't be allowed to implement snapback, pointing in part to America's unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, during the first term of President Trump's administration.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised the three European nations for \"an act of decisive global leadership\" for imposing the sanctions on Iran and said \"diplomacy is still an option.\"",
      "\"For that to happen, Iran must accept direct talks,\" Rubio said.",
      "However, it remains unclear how Tehran will respond Sunday.",
      "\"The Trump administration appears to think it has a stronger hand post-strikes, and it can wait for Iran to come back to the table,\" said Kelsey Davenport, a nuclear expert at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. \"Given the knowledge Iran has, given the materials that remain in Iran, that's a very dangerous assumption.\"",
      "Risks also remain for Iran as well, she added: \"In the short term, kicking out the IAEA increases the risk of miscalculation. The U.S. or Israel could use the lack of inspections as a pretext for further strikes.\"",
      "The aftermath of the June war drove up food prices in Iran, putting already expensive meat out of reach for poorer families.",
      "Iran's government put overall annual inflation at 34.5% in June, and its Statistical Center reported that the cost of essential food items rose over 50% over the same period. But even that doesn't reflect what people see at shops. Pinto beans tripled in price in a year, while butter nearly doubled. Rice, a staple, rose more than 80% on average, hitting 100% for premium varieties. Whole chicken is up 26%, while beer and lamb are up 9%.",
      "\"Every day I see new higher prices for cheese, milk and butter,\" said Sima Taghavi, a mother of two, at a Tehran grocery. \"I cannot omit them like fruits and meat from my grocery list because my kids are too young to be deprived.\"",
      "The pressure over food and fears about the war resuming have seen more patients heading to psychologists since June, local media in Iran have reported.",
      "\"The psychological pressure from the 12-day war on the one hand, and runaway inflation and price hikes on the other, has left society exhausted and unmotivated,\" Dr. Sima Ferdowsi, a clinical psychologist and professor at Shahid Beheshti University, told the Hamshahri newspaper in an interview published in July.",
      "Iran has faced multiple nationwide protests in recent years, fueled by anger over the economy, demands for women's rights and calls for the country's theocracy to change.",
      "In response to those protests and the June war, Iran has been putting prisoners to death at a pace unseen since 1988, when it executed thousands at the end of the Iran-Iraq war. The Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights and the Washington-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran put the number of people executed in 2025 at over 1,000, noting the number could be higher as Iran does not report on each execution.",

    "summary": "The repeated unexplained drone activity has raised concerns about security in northern Europe.",
    "story": [
      "The Danish defense ministry said Saturday that \"drones have been observed at several of Danish defense facilities\" overnight Friday into Saturday. The renewed drone sightings come after there were several drone sightings in the Nordic country earlier this week, with some of them temporarily shutting down Danish airports.",
      "The Danish defense ministry said in a statement that drone activity was noticed at Skrydstrup Air Base and the Jutland Dragoon Regiment.",
      "Several local media reported that one or more drones were also seen near or above the military Karup Air Base, which is Denmark's biggest military base.",
      "The Defense ministry refused to confirm the sighting at Karup and said later that \"for reasons of operational security and the ongoing investigation, the Defense Command Denmark does not wish to elaborate further on drone sightings.\"",
      "Danish public broadcaster DR reported that in Karup, there were drones in the air both inside and outside the fence of the air base at around 8 p.m. local time, quoting Simon Skelkj\u00e6r, the duty manager at the Central and West Jutland Police.",
      "DR said that for a period of time the airspace was closed to civil air traffic, but that did not have much practical significance as there is currently no civil aviation in Karup.",
      "The repeated unexplained drone activity, including over four Danish airports overnight Wednesday into Thursday and a similar incident at Copenhagen Airport has raised concerns about security in northern Europe.",
      "Flights resumed early Tuesday at Copenhagen airport after being suspended or diverted overnight because of drone sightings. Police reported two to three large, unidentified drones were seen Monday night, forcing outgoing flights at Scandinavia's largest airport to be grounded and others diverted to airports nearby.",
      "Jens Jespersen of the Copenhagen Police said the those responsible seemed to be showing off their skills, adding that the number, large size and flight patterns of the unidentified drones combined indicated \"that it is a capable actor. Which capable actor, I do not know.\"",
      "Police in neighboring Norway said they had seized a drone near Oslo's airport, the AFP news agency reported. A public prosecutor in Norway said Thursday that there was nothing to immediately suggest any link between the Oslo incident and the drones seen in Denmark, according to AFP.",
      "Neither Danish nor Norwegian officials have accused anyone of responsibility. But the incidents come with many European nations on alert following Russian drone and fighter jet incursions into Poland, Romania and Estonia.",
      "The goal of the flyovers is to sow fear and division, Danish Minister of Justice Peter Hummelgaard said Thursday, adding that the country will seek additional ways to neutralize drones, including proposing legislation to allow infrastructure owners to shoot them down.",
      "For the upcoming European Union summit next week, the Danish defense ministry confirmed on X that the country's government had accepted an offer from Sweden to \"lend Denmark a military anti-drone capability,\" without giving further details.",
      "In neighboring Germany, several drones were reported in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which borders Denmark, from Thursday into Friday night.",
      "The state's interior minister, Sabine S\u00fctterlin-Waack, said that \"the state police are currently significantly stepping up their drone defense measures, also in coordination with other northern German states,\" German news agency dpa reported. She did not provide any further details, citing the ongoing investigations.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that in regard to frequent attacks on infrastructure and data networks, \"we are not at war, but we are no longer living in peace either.\" He did not allude to a certain country as the actor behind those attacks.",
      "\"Drone flights, espionage, the Tiergarten murder, massive threats to individual public figures, not only in Germany but also in many other European countries. Acts of sabotage on a daily basis. Attempts to paralyze data centers. Cyberattacks,\" he added during a speech at the Schwarz Ecosystem Summit in Berlin on Friday, dpa reported.",
      "What became known as the \"Tiergarten murder\" in Germany refers to the case of Vadim Krasikov, who was convicted of the Aug. 23, 2019, killing of Zelimkhan \"Tornike\" Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany. Krasikov was returned to Russia as part of a massive prisoner swap between the U.S. and Russia in 2024.",
      "One of the six runways at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport was closed for about 45 minutes early Saturday afternoon after reports of a drone sighting around noon local time, military police spokesman Doron Wallin told The Associated Press. Aircraft were redirected to another runway.",
      "Wallin said no drone or drone pilot was found and the runway was reopened. He said that such reported sightings are a regular occurence, with 22 so far this year.",
      "NATO on airspace violations",
      "Later on Saturday, Adm. Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the chair of NATO's Military Committee, said at a NATO meeting in Riga, Latvia, that \"Russian aircraft and drones, on top of the already existing measures will now find the resolute response of the newly established and already operational Eastern Sentry activity, which further strengthen NATO's ability to react quickly and decisively against this kind of reckless behavior.\"",
      "\"Russia bears full responsibility for these actions,\" Dragone said. \"Today, I express full and unequivocal solidarity with all allies whose airspace has been breached. The alliance's response has been robust and will only continue to strengthen,\" he said.",
      "Latvian President Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds said that \"the immediate priority today is clearly air defense.\"",
      "\"Russia continues a pattern of provocations, most recently recklessly violating the airspace of Poland and Estonia,\" Rink\u0113vi\u010ds said."

      "Prince William called 2024 the \"hardest year\" of his life in a preview for a rare television interview.",
      "The year saw William's wife Katherine, Princess of Wales, and his\u00a0father, King Charles, diagnosed with and treated for cancer. William and Kate, as she is commonly called, share three young children. The prince and his younger brother, Prince Harry, also remain distant.",
      "\"I'd say 2024 was the hardest year I've ever had,\" William was shown telling \"Schitt's Creek\" star Eugene Levy in a preview for an episode of Levy's Apple TV+ show \"The Reluctant Traveler.\"",
      "The full episode will be aired on Oct. 3. One clip from the preview showed William giving Levy a tour of Windsor Castle. Another showed the two men sitting at a pub, sharing a pint.",
      "\"Life is said to test us as well, and being able to overcome that is what makes us who we are,\" William said in the preview.",
      "Charles, 76,\u00a0announced his cancer diagnosis in February 2024. It was discovered while he underwent treatment for an enlarged prostate. Buckingham Palace did not say what kind of cancer he had, but said it was not of the prostate. The king resumed public appearances in May 2024.",
      "\"Each diagnosis, each new case, will be a daunting and at times frightening experience for those individuals and their loved ones,\" Charles wrote in a booklet given to guests at Buckingham Palace event celebrating cancer charities in April 2025. \"But as one among those statistics myself, I can vouch for the fact that it can also be an experience that brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity.\"",
      "Kate's announcement that she had cancer came just six weeks after the king's. Kate, 43, also did not say what kind of cancer she had, but said she had undergone chemotherapy to treat it. The announcement followed weeks of speculation about Kate's wellbeing. In September 2024, the princess said she had completed chemotherapy and made\u00a0a return to public duties. In January, she said\u00a0she was in remission.",
      "While visiting a cancer support center in July 2025, Kate compared cancer recovery to \"a roller coaster.\"",
      "\"You go through hard times,\" the princess said. The difficulties continue even after treatment, she added.",
      "\"You're not necessarily under the clinical team any longer, but you're not able to function normally at home as you perhaps once used to,\" she said.",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 12:10:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began speaking at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, dozens of people walked out of the room in protest.",
    "story": [
      "Encircled by critics and protesters at the United Nations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told fellow world leaders on Friday that Israel \"must finish the job\" against Hamas in Gaza, giving a defiant speech despite growing international isolation over his refusal to end the devastating war in Gaza.",
      "\"Western leaders may have buckled under the pressure,\" he said. \"And I guarantee you one thing: Israel won't.\"",
      "He spoke after dozens of delegates from multiple nations walked out of the U.N. General Assembly hall en masse Friday as he began.",
      "Responding to countries' recent decisions to recognize Palestinian statehood, Netanyahu said: \"Your disgraceful decision will encourage terrorism against Jews and against innocent people everywhere.\"",
      "As the Israeli leader spoke, unintelligible shouts echoed around the hall. Applause rang out in other quarters as he spoke. The U.S. delegation, which has backed Netanyahu in his campaign against Hamas, stayed put. The few world powers in attendance, the United States and the United Kingdom, did not send their most senior officials or even their UN ambassador to their section. Instead, it was filled out with more junior, low-level diplomats.",
      "\"Anti-semitism dies hard. In fact, it doesn't die at all,\" Netanyahu said. Netanyahu routinely accuses his critics of antisemitism.",
      "Netanyahu faces international isolation, accusations of war crimes and growing pressure to end a conflict he has continued to escalate. Friday's speech was his chance to push back on the international community's biggest platform.",
      "As he has often in the past at the United Nations, Netanyahu held up a visual aid - a map of the region titled \"THE CURSE.\" He marked it up with a large marker. He ascended the podium wearing a special hostages pin with a QR code that leads to a site about Oct. 7 that was established specially for international public diplomacy needs. The members of the prime minister's delegation, ministers and those accompanying him also wore identical pins.",
      "Netanyahu also frequently praised President Donald Trump, his chief ally in his political and military approach in the region.",
      "On Iran, he thanked Mr. Trump \"for his bold and decisive action,\" and said the world \"must remain vigilant.\"",
      "Netanyahu said the changes across the Mideast have created new opportunities. He said Israel has begun negotiations with Syria aimed at reaching security arrangements with the country's new government.",
      "Back in the Mideast, Netanyahu said the Israeli government was taking steps to ensure that those in Gaza and others heard what he had to say.",
      "He said the military set up loudspeakers at the Israel-Gaza border to blast his words into the territory, and addressed the remaining Israeli hostages, who have been held in Gaza since Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack nearly two years ago.",
      "\"Our brave heroes, this is Prime Minister Netanyahu speaking to you live from the United Nations. We have not forgotten you, not even for a second. The people of Israel are with you. We will not falter and we will not rest until we bring all of you home,\" he said.",
      "In an \"unprecedented operation,\" by Israeli intelligence, Netanyahu said his speech would also be streamed over the mobile phones of Gaza residents.",
      "It was not immediately clear if that happened, or to what extent. Neither CBS News nor AP journalists inside Gaza saw any immediate evidence of Netanyahu's speech being broadcast on phones there.",
      "Netanyahu's annual speech to the U.N. General Assembly is always closely watched, often protested, reliably emphatic and sometimes a venue for dramatic allegations. But this time, the stakes are higher than ever for the Israeli leader.",
      "In recent days, Australia, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and others announced their recognition of an independent Palestinian state.",
      "The European Union is considering tariffs and sanctions on Israel. The assembly this month passed a nonbinding resolution urging Israel to commit to an independent Palestinian nation, which Netanyahu has said is a non-starter.",
      "The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant accusing Netanyahu of crimes against humanity, which he denies. And the U.N's highest court is weighing South Africa's allegation that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, which it vehemently refutes.",
      "Earlier this month, an independent panel of experts commissioned by the United Nations Human Rights Council concluded \"the Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have committed and are continuing to commit\" acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "Against that backdrop, Netanyahu sounded resolute Thursday as he boarded a plane in Israel to head for the U.N.'s annual meeting of top-level leaders in New York.",
      "\"I will tell our truth,\" Netanyahu said. \"I will condemn those leaders who, instead of condemning the murderers, rapists and burners of children, want to give them a state in the heart of Israel.\"",
      "At a special session of the assembly this week, nation after nation expressed horror at the Oct. 7 2023 terrorist attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel, saw 251 taken hostage and triggered the war. Many of the representatives went on to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and influx of aid.",
      "Israel's sweeping offensive has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and displaced 90 percent of its population, with an increasing number now starving, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "While more than 150 countries now recognize a Palestinian state, the United States has not, providing Israel with vociferous support. But Mr. Trump pointedly signaled Thursday there are limits, telling reporters in Washington that he wouldn't let Israel annex the occupied West Bank.",
      "Israel hasn't announced such a move, but several leading members in Netanyahu's government have advocated doing so. And officials recently approved a controversial settlement project that would effectively cut the West Bank in two, a move that critics say could doom chances for a Palestinian state. Mr. Trump and Netanyahu are scheduled to meet during his visit.",
      "Netanyahu's office also \"instructed civilian groups in cooperation with the army to place loudspeakers on trucks on the Israeli side of the border,\" it said in a statement, noting that the broadcasts would be arranged so they would not endanger soldiers.",
      "Netanyahu was preceded Thursday by Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who addressed the General Assembly via video, since the U.S. denied him a visa. He welcomed the announcements of recognition but said the world needs to do more to make statehood happen.",
      "\"The time has come for the international community to do right by the Palestinian people\" and help them realize \"their legitimate rights to be rid of the occupation and to not remain a hostage to the temperament of Israeli politics,\" he said.",
      "Abbas leads the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, which administers portions of the West Bank. Hamas won legislative elections in Gaza in 2006 before seizing control from Abbas' forces the following year.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war, then withdrew from Gaza in 2005. The Palestinians want all three territories to form their envisioned state, part of a \"two-state solution\" that the international community has embraced for decades.",
      "Netanyahu opposes it robustly, maintaining that creating a Palestinian state would reward Hamas.",
      "\"This will not happen,\" he said at the airport Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "For 25 years,\u00a0Bill Gates\u00a0says the world has seen what he calls \"miraculous\" progress. He told \"CBS Mornings\" that annual child deaths have dropped globally from more than 10 million to fewer than 5 million.",
      "But now, he warns, 2025 could mark the first year in decades when more children die than the year before.",
      "\"We shouldn't have this be the first year that more children die than the year before,\" Gates told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"We should continue the progress that Americans should be very proud of.\"",
      "Gates delivered the warning as he announced a $912 million pledge over three years to fight infectious diseases worldwide, calling this moment a crossroads that will test whether the U.S. continues its role in saving lives.",
      "The Microsoft co-founder pointed to breakthrough innovations \u2014 from AI-driven tools that prevent HIV infections to new methods of eliminating malaria-carrying mosquitoes \u2014 but cautioned that progress will stall without sustained funding. At stake, he said, is whether the U.S. will continue devoting roughly 1% of its budget to global health, an investment that has delivered unprecedented results.",
      "\"If we just maintain that modest level, because of the great innovations and incredible people in the field doing this work, we can cut it in half again,\" Gates said.",
      "He recently testified before the Senate about the consequences of cutting foreign health aid. The Trump administration has already reduced funding, and delayed payments have fueled rising debts. Gates said he has spoken directly with President Trump about the issue but admitted future funding levels remain uncertain.",
      "\"Well, there have been a lot of payments that aren't being made right now, and so we are seeing debts go up,\" he said. \"The big question is, when they set the new budget, what level will it be set at, and will that money actually be sent out? This is a great time that the Congress gets to show its sense of values to continue the fight against polio, to make sure mothers get the nutrition they need.\"",
      "Gates, who plans to give away nearly all of his wealth within the next 20 years, stressed that the 1% investment produces outsized benefits. It supports disease detection systems that can identify pandemics before they reach the U.S. and helps poorer nations stabilize, grow their economies, and join the global marketplace.",
      "Faith leaders have also framed the issue as a moral imperative, Gates added, noting that the other 99% of the federal budget remains dedicated to domestic priorities.",
      "\"When you say American first, can you still have the charity for that 1%?\" he asked.",

      "Experts agree that exercise is vital to longevity and helps to preserve muscle mass, bone density and joint health as we age. But it\u2019s important to approach workouts in the right way to ensure safe, optimal results.",
      "The general guideline is for healthy adults to get 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week, along with at least two days of strength training and activities to improve balance.",
      "However, these recommendations should be modified to meet each individual\u2019s physical abilities and conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "FITNESS EXPERT REVEALS 6 PILLARS OF STRENGTH TRAINING THAT OLDER ADULTS SHOULD MASTER",
      "\"Most adults are not failing in the gym because they are lazy. They are failing because no one ever taught them how to train for the stage of life they are in right now,\" Marfred Suazo, a fitness professional known as Fonz the Trainer in New York City, told Fox News Digital.",
      "The general guideline is for healthy adults to get 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week. (iStock)",
      "\"They keep doing the same workouts they did years ago and wonder why their back aches, their knees are sore and their progress has stalled.\"",
      "Fox News Digital spoke with fitness experts to identify some of the most common mistakes older adults make when working out and how to avoid them.",
      "\"Most people focus only on the chest, arms, quads and abs, because that is what they see in the mirror,\" Suazo said. \"But ignoring your back, glutes, hamstrings and core creates poor posture, weak links and, eventually, pain.\"",
      "OLDER ADULTS SHOULD TARGET THESE MUSCLES WHEN STRENGTH-TRAINING, SAYS FITNESS PRO",
      "To counteract this, Suazo recommends training the muscles you cannot see, a strategy he calls \"non-mirror training.\"",
      "\"Add rows, Romanian dead lifts, hip bridges, Paloff presses and farmer\u2019s carries to your routine,\" he advised. \"This type of training builds strength that shows up in your posture, balance and the way you move every day.\"",
      "Orrie Markfeld, a personal trainer at Life Time Garden City in New York, said a common mistake he sees is older adults trying to work out with the same intensity and volume as when they were younger, which often leads to overuse injuries and burnout.",
      "\"Most adults are not failing in the gym because they are lazy. They are failing because no one ever taught them how to train for the stage of life they are in right now,\" a fitness trainer said. (iStock)",
      "\"The solution is simple: train smarter,\" he recommended to Fox News Digital. \"Follow principles of progressive overload and proper mechanics and make recovery days a priority.",
      "\"Longer warm-ups, mobility prep and respecting rest go a long way toward preventing setbacks.\"",
      "\"Walking, biking and spin classes are great, but if you avoid strength training, you lose muscle and power with every passing year,\" Sauzo told Fox News Digital. \"That makes you more likely to get hurt and slows recovery.\"",
      "Building muscle helps protect the joints, speeds up metabolism and ensures strength for life, according to the expert.",
      "\"They keep doing the same workouts they did years ago and wonder why their back aches, their knees are sore and their progress has stalled.\"",
      "Suazo confirmed that adults should strength train at least two times per week. \"Start light, master the form and progress slowly,\" he recommends.",
      "Markfeld agreed that many older adults stick only to cardio, thinking it\u2019s all they need.",
      "Building muscle helps protect the joints, speeds up metabolism and ensures strength for life, experts say. (iStock)",
      "\"The problem is, skipping resistance training accelerates muscle and bone loss, which are critical for staying active and independent,\" he reiterated.",
      "\"Including two to three days a week of strength and resistance-specific work is ideal. This can be as simple as body weight movements, resistance bands or dumbbells, focusing on compound/functional movements like squats, pushes and pulls.\"",
      "Going straight from sitting at a desk to lifting weights is a recipe for injury, according to Suazo.",
      "\"Cold muscles and stiff joints make even simple exercises harder than they should be,\" he warned.",
      "HOLLYWOOD ICON HAS USED THE SAME 12-MINUTE WORKOUT ROUTINE SINCE THE 1960S",
      "To help ensure a safe, successful workout, Suazo recommends spending five minutes preparing your body. This can include walking as well as doing hip openers, shoulder circles and a few body weight squats.",
      "\"You will lift better, feel better and recover faster,\" the expert said.",
      "\"Fast, sloppy reps and ego lifting are the reason most people end up with sore shoulders and bad backs,\" Suazo cautioned.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The trainer emphasized the importance of slowing down.",
      "\"Choose a weight you can control, move with intention and feel the muscles working,\" he said. \"Controlled reps will keep you safe and build strength you can use.\"",
      "\"If you are sore all the time, you are not getting stronger, you are just breaking your body down,\" Suazo said. \"Strength is built when you recover, not just when you train.\"",
      "When you train this way, you will move better, feel younger and keep doing the things you love without pain holding you back,\" a trainer said. (iStock)",
      "It\u2019s important to make recovery part of your plan, the expert advised. This can include walking, stretching, taking an active recovery day and getting quality sleep.",
      "\"Your body will reward you by coming back stronger.\"",
      "\"Many people overlook mobility and balance work,\" Markfeld noted. \"These decline naturally with age and are major factors in injury risk.\"",
      "\"Focus on non-mirror training, slow your movements down and respect your recovery time.\"",
      "He suggests dedicating 10 to 15 minutes of every workout to joint mobility, core stability and balance exercises.",

Roughly 41,000 homeowners bought new policies while about 33,000 dropped coverage, leaving a net gain of nearly 9,000. Officials warn that similar growth this year could collapse if NFIP lapses.",

NAHB calls upon the House to act quickly to continue to fund the operations of the federal government including the extension of the NFIP.\"",

Lawmakers have typically made coverage retroactive to prevent permanent gaps, but even brief lapses have stalled real estate closings and left homeowners in limbo. The program currently serves about 4.5 million policyholders nationwide.",

      "With construction progressing at a snail\u2019s pace and costs ballooning from an original estimate of $330 million to at least $850 million, the lack of progress on the promised endowment has fueled fears the Obama Presidential Center could leave taxpayers holding the can if finances spiral into the red.",

      "\"It should come as no surprise that the Obama Center is potentially leaving Illinois taxpayers high and dry \u2014 it\u2019s an Illinois Democrat tradition,\" Salvi told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"Democrats in this state, when not going to prison for corruption, treat taxpayers like a personal piggy bank giving sweetheart deals to their political benefactors.\"",

      "\"They put a million dollars into a $400 million endowment, so it\u2019s endowed. That gets you in jail as a securities matter,\" Epstein told Fox News Digital. \"An endowment means that you have the money in hand. But they have nothing. They just have the same $1 million that they put in in 2021 as far as I can tell. So, I regard this as something of a public calamity.\"",
      "An endowment is a pot of money meant to earn enough interest each year to cover operating costs without touching the principle in order to avoid the taxpayer stepping in.",
      "\"Without an endowment, they\u2019ll have to scramble every year to cover $30 million in operating costs,\" Epstein said. \"The whole point of an endowment is to avoid that volatility. They just haven\u2019t endowed it. Of that I\u2019m 100% sure.\"",
      "Epstein argues that if the foundation or center falters, the public could be saddled with traffic rerouting costs, environmental impacts or even the bill for an incomplete building.",
      "\"Nobody knows exactly who is responsible for what if the project is abandoned or incomplete,\" Epstein said. \"There is a risk that the public will then have to bear that loss because the foundation won\u2019t have the money.\"",
      "Epstein said the city has effectively looked the other way, declaring the foundation \"compliant\" on the endowment despite only $1 million ever being deposited. It's proof, he argues, that officials never intended to enforce the requirement.",
      "The\u00a0Obama\u00a0Foundation told Fox News Digital that it will be making \"significant investments in the\u00a0endowment\u00a0in the coming years\" as it has been prioritizing fundraising for the center and leadership programs.",

      "While the foundation\u2019s agreement with the city required it to create an endowment, it did not specify an amount. The $470 million figure was being reported on as the city council deliberated on the deal, and the foundation committed to that sum in its 2020 annual report.",
      "In 2021 documents, the foundation said that first-year operating costs would be as much as $40 million. By that math, the center would actually need an endowment of between $800 million to $1 billion to fund operations without tapping the principle.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear how much revenue the foundation expects to generate each year.",
      "Epstein said the lack of funds has long been the project\u2019s Achilles heel. Without the endowment it promised, the project's financial underpinning remains shaky, he said.",

It consists of a 225-foot-tall museum, a digital library, conference facilities, a gymnasium and a regulation-sized NBA court. It will also house the Obama Foundation.",
      "The new tax filings show the foundation ended 2024 with $116.5 million in cash, down nearly $80 million from the year before, while still owing about $234 million in construction costs. Of the funding gap, $216 million comes from firm pledges \u2014 promises of future donations \u2014 while another $201 million is tied up in conditional pledges that may never materialize if benchmarks aren\u2019t met.",
      "Epstein said the foundation\u2019s financial assurances ring hollow because a large chunk of the money it counts on is tied up in pledges and credit rather than cash in hand, leaving the center vulnerable to donor fatigue and year-to-year uncertainty.",
      "WATCH: The Brian Kilmeade Show: Obama Presidential Center rocked by $40M racial bias lawsuit",
      "In the Protect Our Parks lawsuit, Epstein argued that handing Jackson Park to the Obama Foundation violated the public trust doctrine, which bars cities from giving away public land without a clear public benefit. The plaintiffs said the city gave away land worth nearly $200 million without securing enforceable returns for taxpayers.",
      "However, U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey, an Obama appointee, dismissed the case in 2019, ruling that the Obama Center qualified as a public use and that courts should defer to the city\u2019s determination. The Seventh Circuit\u00a0upheld the dismissal in 2020 and various other challenges by the plaintiffs have also failed on the public trust doctrine argument.",
      "Epstein now points to the foundation\u2019s failure to fund its promised endowment as proof the project never truly met the public benefit test and that a core part of his argument was valid.",
      "As well as not being able to fill the endowment, the foundation is also financing a $250 million revolving credit line that it has yet to draw down but is costing the foundation hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual fees, according to the tax filings.",

      "The move grew out of an earlier fight over filmmaker George Lucas\u2019s bid to build a Museum of Narrative Art on the lakefront. In 2016, a federal judge ruled the city\u2019s plan to hand Lucas a 99-year lease of public parkland violated the public trust doctrine, sending Lucas packing for Los Angeles.",

      "\"They\u2019ve gotten a free pass on both the environmental side and the financial side,\" Epstein said. \"Unless somebody cracks open the books, nobody really knows if they can actually fund this project. And if they can\u2019t, it\u2019s the public that will be left holding the bag.\"",

      "South Korean cybersecurity firm Genians revealed the campaign in a recent blog post. While ChatGPT has safeguards that block attempts to generate government IDs, the hackers tricked the system. Genians said the model produced realistic-looking mock-ups when prompts were framed as\u00a0\"sample designs for legitimate purposes.\"",

      "Kimsuky is no small-time operator. The group has been tied to a string of espionage campaigns against South Korea, Japan and the U.S. Back in 2020, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Kimsuky was\u00a0\"most likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence-gathering mission.\"\u00a0Genians, which uncovered the fake ID scheme, said this latest case underscores just how much generative AI has changed the game.",
      "\"Generative AI has lowered the barrier to entry for sophisticated attacks. As this case shows, hackers can now produce highly convincing fake IDs and other fraudulent assets at scale. The real concern is not a single fake document, but how these tools are used in combination. An email with a forged attachment may be followed by a phone call or even a video appearance that reinforces the deception. When each channel is judged in isolation, attacks succeed. The only sustainable defense is to verify across multiple signals such as voice, video, email and metadata, in order to uncover the inconsistencies that AI-driven fraud cannot perfectly hide,\" Sandy Kronenberg, CEO and founder of Netarx, a cybersecurity and IT services company, warned.",

The hacker targeted Vietnamese telecommunications providers, agriculture systems and even government databases.",
      "According to OpenAI, Chinese hackers also tapped ChatGPT to build password brute-forcing scripts and to dig up sensitive information on U.S. defense networks, satellite systems and ID verification systems. Some operations even leveraged ChatGPT to generate fake social media posts designed to stoke political division in the U.S.",

      "\"For years, employees were trained to look for typos or formatting issues. That advice no longer applies. They tricked ChatGPT into designing fake military IDs by asking for 'sample templates.' The result looked clean, professional and convincing. The usual red flags \u2014 typos, odd formatting, broken English \u2014 weren't there. AI scrubbed all that out.",
      "\"Security training needs a reset. We need to teach people to focus on context, intent and verification. That means encouraging teams to slow down, check sender info, confirm requests through other channels and report anything that feels off. No shame in asking questions,\" Williamson added. \"On the tech side, companies should invest in email authentication, phishing-resistant MFA and real-time monitoring. The threats are faster, smarter and more convincing. Our defenses need to be too. And for individuals? Stay sharp. Ask yourself why you\u2019re getting a message, what it\u2019s asking you to do and how you can confirm it safely. The tools are evolving. So must we. Because if we don\u2019t adapt, the average user won\u2019t stand a chance.\"",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the latest scam takes exploitation of a trusted platform to a new level. Instead of sending generic or suspicious-looking emails, attackers are now abusing Apple's iCloud Calendar invite system to deliver phishing content directly from Apple's own email servers.",
      "This clever tactic allows the fraudulent messages to bypass spam filters and appear more legitimate to unsuspecting users. The goal is to alarm you into calling a scammer's fake support number under the pretense of disputing a fraudulent PayPal transaction. Once contacted, you are manipulated into granting remote access to your devices or sharing sensitive data.",

      "NEW EVITE PHISHING SCAM USES EMOTIONAL EVENT INVITATIONS TO TARGET VICTIMS",
      "Scammers exploit Apple\u2019s iCloud Calendar to deliver phishing invites that bypass spam filters. (Brent Lewin/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How the scam uses iCloud Calendar invites to bypass security",
      "The heart of this scam lies in abusing Apple's official infrastructure to lend credibility to a phishing attempt. Instead of using a suspicious or easily flagged email address, the attackers send calendar invites from Apple's genuine domain, noreply@email.apple.com, as reported by Bleeping Computer.",
      "The attacker embeds the phishing message in the \"Notes\" section of the calendar event, making it appear as a legitimate notification. They send the calendar invite to a Microsoft 365 email address they control, which is part of a mailing list. As a result, the invite is automatically forwarded to multiple real targets, broadening the scam\u2019s reach.",
      "Typically, when emails are forwarded, SPF (Sender Policy Framework) checks fail because the forwarding server isn't listed as an authorized sender. However, Microsoft 365 uses a technique called the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS), which rewrites the return path so that the message still passes SPF checks.",
      "This makes the email appear fully legitimate to both the recipient's inbox and automated spam filters. As a result, the message is far more likely to reach a user's inbox without being flagged, increasing the chance the victim will take the bait.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE USING DOCUSIGN EMAILS TO PUSH APPLE PAY FRAUD",
      "Cybercriminals leverage Microsoft 365 forwarding and Apple\u2019s email domain to outsmart filters. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Why these phishing scams are particularly dangerous",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is the sense of legitimacy it conveys. Because Apple\u2019s official servers send the email directly, users are far less likely to suspect foul play. The message itself aims to panic the recipient by falsely claiming a large PayPal transaction occurred without the recipient's consent. The message includes a phone number to \"contact support\" and dispute the charge, but, in reality, it connects the victim to a scammer.",
      "Once the victim calls the number, the scammer poses as a technical support agent and attempts to convince the caller that the computer has been compromised. The next step is typically to ask the victim to download remote access software under the guise of issuing a refund or securing the account.",
      "In reality, this access is used to steal banking information, install malware or exfiltrate personal data. Because the original message passed security checks and seemed credible, victims often don't think twice before acting.",

      "Fraudsters are hijacking iCloud Calendar invites to trick users into calling fake support lines. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from iCloud Calendar scammers",
      "I have listed some useful steps you can take to protect yourself from falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated phishing scams:",
      "If you receive an unexpected calendar invite, especially one containing a strange message or alarming claims, don't open it or respond. Legitimate companies rarely send payment disputes or security warnings through calendar invites. Always verify suspicious claims by logging into your official account directly.",
      "Phishing scams often include phone numbers that connect you to fraudsters posing as support agents. Instead of calling the number in the message, use official contact details found on the company's official website.",
      "Antivirus programs protect your computer from malware and phishing sites by blocking suspicious downloads and warning you about unsafe websites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Also, keeping your antivirus updated ensures it can defend against the latest threats.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Hackers are able to send you these phishing emails because they have your data. Using a personal data removal service helps scrub your personal information from data broker websites. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to gather details about you and craft convincing, targeted phishing attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A password manager helps you generate and securely store strong, unique passwords for every account. This reduces the risk of reusing weak passwords that scammers can easily exploit to gain unauthorized access to your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Regularly updating your operating system, browser and applications helps patch security vulnerabilities that attackers often exploit in phishing scams. Staying current with updates minimizes your exposure to known threats.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Scammers are taking phishing attacks in a disturbing new direction by manipulating trusted platforms to deliver malicious content. The safest approach is to treat any unexpected calendar invite, especially those with alarming messages or strange contact numbers, with extreme caution. Never call the number provided in the message or click on any links. Instead, go directly to official websites or your account's official dashboard to verify suspicious activity.",

Alef Aeronautics announced formal agreements with Half Moon Bay and Hollister airports to begin test operations of a road-legal, vertical-takeoff flying car.

The Model A will drive, take off vertically, fly forward, land vertically and maneuver on both roads and runways. Alef will alert other aircraft before its carplanes move on the ground or in the air.

      "Overpayment scams are on the rise, and they can leave victims thousands of dollars in debt. The setup usually looks harmless: someone sends you a check for more than the agreed amount, asks you to forward the difference and disappears once the check bounces. Below are five of the most common overpayment scams you need to watch for today.",

      "FBI WARNS SENIORS ABOUT BILLION-DOLLAR SCAM DRAINING RETIREMENT FUNDS, EXPERT SAYS AI DRIVING IT",
      "1. The dog walker overpayment scam",
      "Bob from Harrison, Ohio, recently shared how he was nearly tricked by a scammer posing as a pet owner. The con began with a request for dog sitting. Bob was promised $250 for care and food, but then a fake check for $4,358 arrived.",
      "The scammer instructed Bob to send $4,000 of it to an \"appliance retailer.\" Why an appliance retailer when the service was for dog sitting? Scammers often use a third party to make the request sound more believable. If they simply asked for the money back, it would raise red flags. By inventing another company, whether a retailer, shipping service or contractor, they add urgency and legitimacy to the story. In reality, that \"retailer\" is just another front that the scammer controls. Here's the catch: the check appears to be real, but it's actually counterfeit. The bank may release the funds temporarily, but once it bounces, you're on the hook for the entire amount.",
      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip: If you're asked to forward money to a third party, especially one unrelated to the original deal, treat it as a scam. Keep the check and envelope as evidence, and report it to the FTC and your state attorney general.",
      "2. The online marketplace scam",
      "Selling a couch, bike or electronics online? Some buyers \"accidentally\" send too much. They then ask you to return the difference through Zelle, Venmo or a wire transfer. Once the check or payment reverses, you've lost both the product and the money you returned.",
      "Tip: Always insist on verified payment methods. If a buyer pushes you for a refund quickly, walk away.",
      "FAKE AGENT PHONE SCAMS ARE SPREADING FAST ACROSS THE US",
      "Scammers may try to recruit buyers into buying gift cards before a false check they provided bounces. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. The mystery shopper scam",
      "You might get an email or letter offering a job as a mystery shopper. They send you a large check to \"test\" stores by buying gift cards. You're asked to send the gift card numbers back as proof of purchase. After the bank reverses the fake check, you've lost the money you spent on those gift cards.",
      "Tip: Real companies never pay upfront with extra funds or ask for gift card codes by email.",
      "4. The rental deposit scam",
      "Scammers target renters by mailing a check for more than the deposit or rent. They claim it was a mistake and ask you to refund the difference. The check later bounces, leaving you stuck.",
      "Tip: Only accept payments through secure online portals or in person with verified funds.",
      "5. The work-from-home equipment scam",
      "This one lures jobseekers. The \"employer\" sends a large check to buy office equipment, then directs you to forward the extra funds to a vendor. Of course, the check is fake, and the supposed vendor is also the scammer.",
      "Tip: Legitimate employers provide equipment directly or reimburse verified expenses, not through overpayments.",

      "Scammers target remote workers by promising to provide a stipend for work-from-home tech. (iStock)",
      "How to protect yourself from overpayment scams",
      "Now that you've seen how these scams play out, from fake dog sitting gigs to marketplace frauds and bogus job offers, it's clear they all follow the same playbook. Someone sends you too much money and pressures you to forward the extra. That \"extra\" never existed, and once the check bounces, you're left holding the bag. The good news is, there are clear steps you can take to protect yourself and keep your money safe.",
      "Every scam in this article, from the dog walker hoax to rental deposit tricks, begins with an overpayment that looks harmless. If someone pays you more than you're owed, it's not a mistake. It's a scam. Do not respond or send money to any third party. Save the check and envelope as evidence, then report it.",
      "Scammers count on you trusting what you see in your account. In Bob's case, his $4,358 check looked real because the bank showed it as \"available.\" But available isn't the same as cleared. Always ask your bank to confirm when funds are fully verified before you spend a dime.",
      "Urgency is the scammer's strongest weapon. Marketplace fraudsters, renters and fake employers will pressure you to \"fix\" the mistake right away. Slow down, double-check and don't let anyone force you into quick action.",
      "Whether it's for rent, freelance work or selling a used item, scammers prefer paper checks because they're easy to fake. Stick with secure, traceable payment platforms or in-person verified funds. That way, you don't get stuck when a check bounces.",
      "If you receive a suspicious check, save everything: the envelope, emails, texts and any names used. In the dog sitting scam, Bob's saved emails and the scammer's phone number became valuable evidence. This documentation helps law enforcement and protects you if the scammer tries again under another identity.",
      "Scammers often find victims by scraping personal details from online data brokers. That's how they target renters, pet sitters or jobseekers. Using a personal data removal service can limit your exposure and make you harder to target in the first place. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many banks let you set fraud alerts for large deposits or unusual transactions. Turning these on gives you a chance to review suspicious activity before a scammer pressures you into acting on it.",
      "Just like Bob did when he cut contact with the fake pet owner, reporting scams helps protect others. File with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov and your state attorney general. You can also alert your local police and community groups to stop scammers from targeting someone else.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Overpayment scams prey on trust and urgency. They can pop up in online sales, job offers, rental agreements and even friendly community boards. By knowing the warning signs, you can stop scammers before they reach your wallet. Stay cautious whenever you're asked to deposit more than expected and forward the extra. If it sounds strange, it's probably a scam.",

There is a partition between the driving cab and the main cabin. The star of the show is an L-shaped couch that runs over six feet long. And it's not just any couch. It is deep, plush and inviting. It's the kind of seating where you can stretch out on without bumping into a dinette table or a cabinet corner.",

      "Bedtime gets an upgrade",
      "When the sun goes down, that beautiful lounge transforms. A double bed lowers from the ceiling, turning the room into a proper bedroom without having to rearrange cushions or fold anything in a weird way. In the morning, it lifts right back up, making space for coffee and conversation. It is a smooth trick that makes the van feel more like a studio apartment than a rolling compromise. Neither the couch nor the bed needs to sacrifice comfort the way sofa beds typically do.",
      "Laundry on the road",
      "Let's talk about the washer and dryer. Yes, really. A compact Tiny Wash unit is built right into the wardrobe. It handles just enough for a quick refresh, and it actually dries, too. No more hanging socks from cabinet knobs or relying on campground and public laundromats. For extended trips, this little feature is a money saver and an absolute game changer.",

This setup is ready for real cooking, not just boiling water or reheating prepackaged meals. If you like to eat well on the road, this one is built with you in mind.",
      "A bathroom that feels like a bathroom",
      "At the rear of the van, the bathroom doesn't feel like an afterthought. It has a sink, a full-standing shower and a macerating toilet. Instead of cramming it all into a tiny box, Robeta gave it a soft curtain enclosure that keeps the look minimal and the space functional. It feels clean, intentional and refreshingly roomy.",
      "Power to keep you out there",
      "This luxury van even has the chops for off-roading. The Ananya packs a 10-kilowatt-hour EcoFlow power system with stackable batteries and 450 watts of solar. You can stay off the cord for days without blinking. Add in a 160-liter freshwater tank, diesel heat and hot water via Webasto, and the freedom to wander suddenly looks very comfortable. These amenities are remarkable for a camper van this size.",
      "Robeta Ananya price in the U.S. and how to buy one",

You can wash clothes on the road, sleep in a proper bed and stay powered up for days without plugging in. This means you can explore remote places without giving up the little luxuries that make travel enjoyable. In short, you get the freedom of the open road with the comfort of a high-end apartment.",
      "Stay connected while you roam",
      "When you're traveling in a camper van, nothing kills the vibe faster than losing cell service, especially if you rely on your phone for maps, music, work or keeping in touch. Thankfully, there are two handy solutions to keep you connected: cell phone boosters and mobile hotspots.",
      "Cell phone boosters amplify weak signals from nearby towers, making calls clearer, boosting data speeds and reducing dropped calls. They're ideal for rural drives, national parks or even just passing through patchy areas. Installation typically involves an outside antenna to capture the signal, an amplifier to boost it and an inside antenna to rebroadcast it inside your van.",
      "Mobile hotspots, on the other hand, turn a cellular signal into a private Wi-Fi network for your devices. They're perfect for working remotely from the road, streaming movies or sharing the internet with multiple passengers. Many can run off your phone plan or use a dedicated SIM card for more robust coverage.",
      "Pro tip:\u00a0If your adventures often take you far from towns or highways, a cell phone booster is your best bet for call reliability. If you need strong Wi-Fi for work or entertainment, pair it with a mobile hotspot for the ultimate on-the-road connectivity.",

      "Social platforms are built for speed and visibility. Anyone can create an account in minutes, post content instantly and connect with strangers worldwide. This openness is what makes social media engaging, but it is also what makes it ripe for abuse. Fraudsters exploit the fact that posts, comments and messages are consumed quickly and often without much scrutiny.",
      "Verification systems that were once meant to help users identify legitimate accounts have also lost some of their power. On platforms where checkmarks can be purchased, scammers can buy credibility without earning it. Add in the algorithms that reward viral content and sudden spikes in engagement, and you get the perfect environment for fraud to spread unnoticed.",
      "Scammers know people often lower their guard on social media. In these spaces, users share personal details, build emotional ties with influencers and trust posts that look familiar.

Clicking a bad link or handing over credentials can snowball into long-term consequences. Once scammers get access to your information, it can be sold on dark web marketplaces, used to open fraudulent accounts or leveraged for identity theft.",

Scammers usually recycle generic profile photos or steal images from real people. Reverse image searches can help you confirm if a photo belongs to someone else.",

If it does not recognize the page, that is a red flag that you are looking at a fake.

      "In comments to Fox News Digital, Aguilar said, \"I sincerely, and with bated breath and joy, hope that Amir is alive. I\u2019ve always said as much. I have been in contact with his family and others, and Amir\u2019s family is not aware that he is alive, only that he is 'gone.'",

      "A GHF representative involved in the operation explained the search to find Abboud became not only a matter necessary to uncover what allegedly happened on May 28, but because there was increasing concern regarding threats posed by Hamas as traction picked up around the story.",
      "The official explained that Hamas had a vested interest in making sure this child was not found, as it would discredit Aguilar\u2019s story that a Palestinian boy had been gunned down by Israeli forces outside a GHF site.",

      "Aguilar did not respond to Fox News Digital regarding the intact shirt, and said, \"The new pictures are not Amir.\"",
      "When pressed on where specifically he thought there were discrepancies in the images of the boy, he said, \"Amir in my photos had a scar on his left clavicle. The boy featured by GHF does not.

      "\"My brave little girl, determined to look pretty, put on her makeup one last time,\" Mason said. \"She had planned this moment out in detail. \u2026 Exhausted and broken, she just couldn\u2019t fight anymore. She climbed on top of the backyard tree house, she slipped the noose around her neck, and stepped off into whatever experience eventually awaits all of us.\"",

      "\"The reality of this harm was instant,\" Mason said. \"Tilly was hysterical and spiraling. I rang the school but because this boy, and his mother, denied he\u2019d even had his phone that day, they said they couldn\u2019t do anything. That night, Tilly attempted suicide by cutting her arms and there was a lot of blood. \u2026 She never really recovered.\"",

      "\"We are certainly open to exploring any avenue to ensure the safety of Australian users,\" Longcroftsaid. \"We never feel we are doing enough to exercise our responsibility. We are constantly working, because the safety of children \u2013 as the most vulnerable among our users \u2013 and the safety of all our users is of utmost concern and our responsibility. We invest time, resources and expertise to ensure our systems, services and products are safe in the area of mental health and suicide.\"",
      "Though Australia recently passed a landmark minimum-age law, forcing social media platforms to take reasonable steps to prevent Australians under 16 years old from having accounts or pay millions of dollars in fines, Mason asked the world to adopt a global ban to hold tech companies financially accountable.",
      "\"For parents of lost children, our lives are measured in days, weeks and months from our loss,\" she said. \"By birthdays, anniversaries, Christmases and other events that serve to remind us of life moving on for everyone else, except us. \u2026 Since Tilly died, I\u2019ve sadly had the privilege of meeting so many parents like me \u2026 How many more Tillys must die?\"",

He made clear that it is not a cure for autism and that more research is needed. He does, however, prescribe it to some people with autism.",
      "Noonan\u2019s son Benjamin, who is 4 years old, is one of Frye\u2019s patients.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s higher functioning,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cHe\u2019s verbal, but he really struggled to put together sentences.\u201d Since starting on the medicine, the family believes Benjamin\u2019s speech has improved, though he still has difficulties with hyperactivity and impulsiveness.",
      "Still, Noonan added, he\u2019s under no impression that the drug is a miracle pill. Benjamin also attends a behavioral program preparing him for kindergarten, Noonan said, and he plans to enroll him in speech and occupational therapy. \u201cWe very, very much understand we\u2019re still taking an experimental medication,\u201d he said.",
      "Other families say the drug conferred larger benefits.",
      "Ben Blomgren, of Minneapolis, said his 11-year-old son, Josh, had been prescribed leucovorin off-label in February after he was at risk of being kicked out of school, even as they tried behavioral modification methods.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s pretty severe,\u201d Blomgren said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any language skills. He was not toilet trained.\u201d",
      "After starting the medication, Blomgren said Josh\u2019s sleep improved, he\u2019s fully toilet trained and he\u2019s stopped running away from them.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t overnight, but we saw major improvement,\u201d he said.",
      "Yomarie Miranda, of Florida, said she saw improvements in her 7-year-old son Ethan after he started the medication, including following instructions in class.",
      "Ethan was prescribed the medication off label earlier this month, she said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s now looking at me when I speak with him. He\u2019s talking more than before with complete sentences,\u201d she said.",
      "A highly unusual move",
      "The Food and Drug Administration first approved leucovorin in the 1980s to help reduce the toxic side effects of certain chemotherapy drugs.",
      "In the decades since, researchers have also studied whether it might treat cerebral folate deficiency (CFD), a neurological condition that makes it harder for folate to reach the brain. Some children with autism also have cerebral folate deficiency, which neurologists say can affect speech, mood and behavior. Last Monday, the FDA said it planned to update the drug\u2019s label to include that use.",
      "But the agency\u2019s decision, experts say, rests on just a handful of small studies. And despite Trump\u2019s endorsement, the maker of the brand-name version, GSK, has yet to submit an application to the agency to change the label. In a statement, GSK said it will be submitting the request to expand the approval to include cerebral folate deficiency, though the statement does not mention autism. (Because leucovorin is already an FDA-approved drug, doctors have been able to prescribe it \u201coff label\u201d for other uses, though insurance may not cover it.)",
      "It\u2019s a highly unusual move for the FDA: pushing a drug for chemotherapy side effects as a therapy for autism without a formal submission and limited evidence.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly irresponsible,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. \u201cFor 60-plus years, we\u2019ve counted on the FDA to help patients distinguish between products that work and products that don\u2019t work. And here we saw the FDA making an announcement relying on a summary of unclear data and announcing that they had already decided to approve it.\u201d",
      "Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the nonprofit Autism Science Foundation, was frustrated by the implication that this is a breakthrough in autism research.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like scientists have just been staring at their belly buttons for 20 years, not looking at autism treatments,\u201d Halladay said in an interview earlier this week. \u201cThey have, but the standards have been very high to get [treatments] approved.\u201d",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, said in a statement: \u201cAnalysis across 23 publications from 2009-2024 demonstrated the effectiveness for CFD. Overall, 85% of patients experienced some type of clinical benefit including improved speech/communication capabilities.\u201d Nixon\u2019s statement did not mention autism, and he did not respond to follow-up questions.",
      "David Mandell, a psychiatry professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said HHS\u2019 claim that 85% of patients experienced a benefit is a \u201cquite a conceptual leap\u201d because it assumes people with cerebral folate deficiency also have autism.",
      "Cerebral folate deficiency \u201cis an extremely rare event, and it is accompanied by symptoms of epilepsy, really severe neurodevelopmental problems and some of those symptoms can look like autism, but it\u2019s not,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI could not think of a single FDA approval that has such weak evidence in the past 20 years,\u201d Mandell added.",
      "Frye, the Phoenix neurologist, estimates up to three-quarters of autistic children have antibodies linked to cerebral folate deficiency, based on his research. Other estimates are much lower: Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the nonprofit Autism Science Foundation, put the rates at roughly 10% to 30%.",
      "The studies on leucovorin are small but look interesting, said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner.",
      "\u201cIt certainly merits follow up,\u201d Gottlieb said.",
      "One of the studies was conducted by Frye: a placebo-controlled trial of more than 40 children with the antibodies, published in Molecular Psychiatry in 2018. It found around two-thirds of kids who got the drug saw improvements in verbal communication after 12 weeks. Others saw no changes. The children all had language impairments, as well as a common type of autism that\u2019s not linked to other neurological diseases.",
      "Mandell, however, said the results shouldn\u2019t be taken as evidence.",
      "\u201cThey claim that in certain subgroups of kids in their already small sample, they find these very large effects,\u201d he said, adding that larger-scale trials that establish clear outcomes ahead of time are needed to verify the results.",
      "Kesselheim said it\u2019s important for patients to have access to medications that could have a benefit, especially when there is an unmet medical need. But, he said, there are still a number of unanswered questions.",
      "\u201cThere is no accurate testing for this,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are low folate levels? What are normal folate levels? All of that stuff should be worked out.\u201d",
      "Frye said he currently uses two methods to assess whether a child has a folate deficiency: a spinal tap \u2014 also known as a lumbar puncture \u2014  which involves inserting a needle into the lower back to collect fluid from the spinal cord, and a folate receptor antibody test originally developed for pregnant women that isn\u2019t approved by the FDA for diagnosing folate deficiency in children.",
      "Edward Quadros, a research professor at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University who has worked with Frye studying leucovorin for autism, said parents are already trying the drug, including supplement versions, which aren\u2019t regulated and can be dangerous.",
      "\u201cBy making the FDA approve it, and reputable pharmaceutical companies manufacturing it and selling it, at least it gives you quality dosing,\u201d Quadros said."

      "\"No, not the guarantee. Why would we put that at risk for anything other than in my brain, there\u2019s something I want maybe more than you do,\" he said.",
      "Robyn Brown at first wasn't sure what her husband is talking about, but then realized he was referring to sex.",
      "\"My primary motivation, I\u2019m afraid at this state in my life, would be just how good looking she is. I\u2019m not kidding,\" he said.",

      "In his own confessional, Kody Brown explained himself.",
      "\"I\u2019m being crass here for a reason. I\u2019m saying, 'Yeah, she looks hot. And that would make me want to talk to her. But I\u2019m not interested in marrying her because that won\u2019t matter when I\u2019m getting nagged,'\" he said.",
      "Robyn Brown definitely didn't see eye-to-eye with her husband on this one and explained why in her confessional.",
      "\"For me, I\u2019m like, OK, well so you have the real relationship with me, but then she\u2019s just, what, a concubine? Because that\u2019s pretty much what that is. It should be more than that, for sure. Most women want commitment. They want love, they want tenderness, they want companionship, they want honesty and depth and and emotional intimacy,\" she said.",
      "Kody Brown then addressed the top at further length in an interview.",

She would have to adore Robyn so much that I would never, ever have to worry about whether she was competing with Robyn for my love and affection,\" he said."

For his notable contribution on stage, the \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d star received a Tony nomination for best featured actor in a play. That award, however, went to his stage partner, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who won the Tony for his portrayal of Mason Marzac, Lemming\u2019s openly gay accountant that finds interest in the sport after his client comes out.",
      "\"Take Me Out\" won two Tonys, including best revival of a play, and received an extended run, in which Williams and most of the cast reprised their roles.

      "At the beginning of the video, DeGeneres addressed the camera, sharing, \u201cWe had a very special guest on the show several times, and his name is Tayt, and he thought that I was his girlfriend, so I told him he was my boyfriend, which shocked my wife.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was a very special little human being and just brought joy and life and laughter into every room that he was in,\u201d DeGeneres added as she teared up. \u201cAnd I will miss him.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Jesse Williams is stepping out of the \u201cGrey\u2019s\u201d and into the light with his new Prime Video series, \u201cHotel Costiera.\u201d",
      "Filmed at a real-life luxury hotel on Italy\u2019s Amalfi Coast, Williams throws away his bedside manner to embody Daniel De Luca, a U.S. Marine intelligence officer who now works to solve crimes as fixer for the hotel\u2019s owner, Augusto (Tommaso Ragno), and his daughter Adele (Maria Chiara Giannetta).",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Williams, 44, admits it was refreshing to take a step back from \u201cserious subjects\u201d and jump into something more \u201ccomedic\u201d and \u201clight.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a big part of the appeal. It was a place to play, be light, fun, funny, creative \u2026 amidst all the chaos in the world,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cA lot of my life is around serious subjects. So it was nice to be able to have my work be a little bit different, something where we can kind of take an old school format and do some action. I like to be physical and do something comedic, as well as something with a little bit of stakes.\u201d",
      "Taking big swings is not something new to Williams. The actor made a lasting impression during his Broadway debut in the 2022 revival of the play \u201cTake Me Out.\u201d The production, which also starred Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Patrick J. Adams and Michael Oberholtzer, among others, won a Tony Award for best revival of a play that year, and gave Ferguson his first Tony for best featured actor in a play.",
      "That same year, Williams also took a turn on another murder mystery series when he was cast as a guest star on Season 3 of \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d and played Tobert, a cameraman and documentary filmmaker.",
      "But his time around, Williams, who fans came to know and love as Dr. Jackson Avery on \"Grey\u2019s Anatomy\" for 12 seasons, says he was focused on doing something across the pond.",
      "\u201cI was really interested in storytelling outside of the country, like traveling somewhere and putting together a cast from other countries and having this kind of cultural melange to play with. I thought that it was a good time for this,\u201d he tells TODAY.com.",
      "To accomplish this feat, Williams enlisted a dialect coach to help him learn the romance language.",
      "\u201cI had somebody on Zoom, before I left the country, and then there was somebody on set, just helping me,\u201d he says of his processes to speak the language in occasional scenes. \u201cI kind of had to learn the fundamentals of the language, learn the language, syntax construction, and then my lines, which are always changing, and have to be malleable.\u201d",
      "But don\u2019t expect the actor to be fluent in the millennium-old tongue. \u201cI\u2019m no good with languages,\u201d Williams says laughing, adding \u201cSome people can just adjust and pick it up pretty quickly. I would not say that\u2019s a strong suit for me ... it was work.\u201d",
      "Over the course of six episodes, viewers will see Williams solve different cases as he simultaneously looks into the disappearance of the hotel owner\u2019s younger daughter, Alice (Amanda Campana). Though her family doubts something\u2019s amiss, Daniel believes that she\u2019s in trouble.",
      "While Williams\u2019 character appears to have no issues solving mysteries and being the disarming sleuth, the \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d alum says he doesn\u2019t have much in common with the Marine-turned-fixer.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s so institutionally trained, it\u2019s very opposite of me,\u201d he tells TODAY.com. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine putting myself through the things that he\u2019s put himself through in terms of working his way up the ranks of the military and the culture there. So that\u2019s where we differ. I think a willingness to find the humor in things is, probably, a place that we overlap.\u201d",

      "Van Der Beek was replaced by Lin-Manuel Miranda after he had to miss the event due to stomach viruses. His wife, Kimberly, and kids turned out, however, with his oldest child, Olivia, helping to sing the show\u2019s popular theme, Paula Cole\u2019s \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Wait,\u201d onstage surrounded by several of the drama\u2019s stars. Van Der Beek was moved, emotions magnified as she celebrated her birthday just a few days later.",
      "\u201cMy oldest turned 15 today,\u201d he wrote Sept. 25 alongside video of the moment on Instagram. \u201cSame age that Dawson was in the pilot. To watch you stand there in that red dress, so confidently taking center stage amidst all those people I\u2019ve known so long and cherish so deeply\u2026 I\u2019m just left in awe.\u201d",
      "Van Der Beek, who announced last November that he had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer, applauded how she has grown.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always joked that you came out \u2018parent proof,\u2019 but this last year, as I\u2019ve watched you accelerate into so many big decisions, jump into so many activities, budget your time, do your homework and your hair (which, from my point of view, seem to require roughly the same amount of time & focus \ud83d\ude02)\u2026 the less I think the parent-proof thing is a joke,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Van Der Beek, who has six kids with his wife, then recalled how Olivia handled matters when she once \u201cscrewed up\u201d getting his ticket for her high school football game.",
      "\u201cYou did something remarkable. Something I\u2019d like to THINK you learned from me (but recognize that might be wishful thinking): You immediately took responsibility. Told me it was your first time doing all of it. Apologized succinctly, then did what you could to fix it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI was more proud of how you handled the mess-up than if you\u2019d done it all perfectly the start.\u201d",
      "Van Der Beek, 48, then encouraged her to aim high in life.",
      "\u201cKeep taking big swings, kiddo. Risk imperfection,\u201d he wrote. \u201cKeep dreaming big and most importantly, be true to who you are. Because, while only YOU will know exactly who your most authentic self will be, as someone who\u2019s known you your whole life\u2026 I can guarantee you\u2019re going to love her.

I can\u2019t believe I don\u2019t get to see my castmates, my beautiful cast in person.",
      "\u201cAnd just I want to stand on that stage and thank every single person in the theater for being here tonight,\u201d he continued. \u201cFrom the cast to the crew to everybody who\u2019s doing anything and has been so generous, and especially every single last one of you \u2014 you are the best fans in the world.\u201d"

      "\u201cIntense negotiations have been going on for four days, and will continue for as long as necessary in order to get a Successfully Completed Agreement,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, calling the discussions \u201cvery inspired and productive.\u201d",
      "Trump did not provide any details about the agreement being discussed, but he has previously insisted that Hamas return all of the remaining Israeli hostages kept in Gaza as part of any deal. In his post, he called for \u201cPERMANENT AND LONGLASTING PEACE!\u201d",

      "Israel has killed more than 65,000 people in Gaza over the past 23 months, according to health officials in the enclave. It has also destroyed vast areas of the strip, displaced around 90% of the population and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Trump said Friday that the militant group was \u201cvery much aware of these discussions, and Israel has been informed at all levels,\u201d including Netanyahu. \u201cThere is more Goodwill and Enthusiasm for getting a Deal done, after so many decades, than I have ever seen before,\u201d he added.",

      "Bin Zayed also reiterated support for efforts to achieve a two-state solution in the region, at the same time as Israel pushes ahead with a widely condemned settlement plan that would effectively split the West Bank in two, further fracturing what Palestinians envision as their future state.",
      "UAE leaders have previously said annexation of the West Bank would be a red line for the influential Gulf state, blocking any future recognition of Israel and preventing the completion of Trump\u2019s landmark Abraham Accords that sought to establish diplomatic normalization between Israel and several Arab states including the UAE.",

      "The purpose of the site remains unknown. The latest satellite photos suggest Iran may be cautiously developing the location as an option for uranium enrichment or other nuclear work beyond the reach of America\u2019s powerful \u201cbunker-buster\u201d munitions, analysts said.",
      "\u201cIf they were planning on giving up their nuclear program, I don\u2019t think we would see this construction,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. \u201cThey are going underground. Maybe they\u2019re coming to the table, but they are definitely going underground.\u201d",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, limited the scope of what Pezeshkian could accomplish during his time in New York when he said in an address on Tuesday that Iran would not talk directly to the U.S. about its nuclear program and would not negotiate on the issue of ballistic missiles or uranium enrichment.",
      "While Iran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, hard-line parliamentarians have called for the building of a nuclear weapon. The country now enriches uranium to near-weapons-grade levels \u2014 the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program known to do so.",
      "Asked about the high level of enrichment, Pezeshkian said, \u201cThe religious leader of the country issued fatwa and repeated ... multiple times that it is unholy, or haram, to seek weaponization, to seek nuclear weapons, to seek any type of weapons of mass destruction. This is rooted in our ideology. It is unambiguous. And it is not changeable. So nothing has prevented us from having ... the fullest cooperation with the IAEA.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the United Nations Security Council voted against a Russian and Chinese resolution to delay reimposing sanctions, which, despite the diplomatic push from Pezeshkian and his foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, will very likely lead to penalties being reimposed after the Saturday deadline.",
      "Without a diplomatic breakthrough on the sanctions, critics will likely blast Pezeshkian for coming home empty-handed.",
      "\u201cPezeshkian\u2019s presidential campaign was premised on diplomatic engagement abroad and attempts to moderate the regime\u2019s heavy hand at home,\u201d said Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cMore than a year into office, the limits of significant shifts within a system trapped in half-measures are clear.\u201d",

      "Before traveling to the U.S., Pezeshkian was urged by prominent intellectuals and former officials to meet with Trump directly to reduce tension and prevent another attack from the U.S. or Israel. Asked if he was concerned about more war coming to Iran and an expected meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Pezeshkian struck a defiant tone.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of war. We do not seek war,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump has said that his administration has come to create peace, but the path that they have embarked upon will set fire to the entire region.\u201d",

      "A sweeping, new study has found the rainforest\u2019s largest trees are not only holding their ground, but they\u2019re thriving \u2014 growing, multiplying in number and continuing to play a major role in mitigating the impacts of climate change.",
      "There was a 3.3% expansion in big trees per decade, scientists found, after tracking changes in 188 intact forest plots across the Amazon over the past 30 years.",
      "Led by almost 100 researchers from 60 universities in Brazil, the U.K. and elsewhere, the findings were published Thursday in the journal Nature Plants.",
      "The authors attributed the growth to the rising amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning of gas, oil and coal.",
      "The paper was welcomed as evidence of forest resilience in the face of climate change, but scientists warned these big trees remain vulnerable as droughts, lightning and fires are increasing in frequency, while deforestation continues to pose a serious threat.",
      "There was an understanding that big trees were \u201cexpected to be vulnerable to climate change,\u201d Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert, one of the study\u2019s lead authors, told NBC News in a telephone interview Saturday. \u201cWhat we see here is actually they seem to be showing quite a resilience.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing signs of them dying off,\u201d said Esquivel-Muelbert, who co-authored the study while at Britain\u2019s University of Birmingham but has since moved to the nearby University of Cambridge. \u201cThey are increasing in size and number as well.\u201d",
      "Scientists stressed that while protecting intact forest areas was essential to stabilizing the climate, the Amazon cannot on its own offset the vast amount of carbon dioxide produced worldwide by cars, factories and power stations \u2014 and it remains under threat.",
      "The rainforest is a carbon sink, meaning it stores more carbon than it produces. Pushing the rainforest past its limit could accelerate climate change and have terrible consequences for local communities, including Indigenous groups who depend on it.",
      "Esquivel-Muelbert stressed it was difficult to predict how worsening climate change would have an impact in the future, and hesitated to say that increased CO2 benefited the forest, warning it may cause bigger trees to become more exposed to other factors like drought.",

      "\u201cAlthough we have shown that trees in intact forest are still increasing in size, any benefits of this in terms of the carbon sink can be quite easily negated by deforestation and logging impacts, so preserving these intact forests is really a priority,\u201d she told NBC News.",

      "While many heads of state, corporate leaders and prominent figures endorsed a need for urgent international collaboration on AI, the U.S. delegation criticized the role of the U.N. and pushed back on the idea of centralized governance of AI.",
      "Representing the U.S. in Wednesday\u2019s Security Council meeting on AI, Michael Kratsios, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said, \u201cWe totally reject all efforts by international bodies to assert centralized control and global governance of AI.\u201d",
      "The path to a flourishing future powered by AI does not lie in \u201cbureaucratic management,\u201d Kratsios said, but instead in \u201cthe independence and sovereignty of nations.\u201d",
      "While Kratsios shot down the idea of combined AI governance, President Donald Trump said in his speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday that the White House will be \u201cpioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust\u201d to enforce the Biological Weapons Convention.",
      "\u201cHopefully, the U.N. can play a constructive role, and it will also be one of the early projects under AI,\u201d Trump said. AI \u201ccould be one of the great things ever, but it also can be dangerous, but it can be put to tremendous use and tremendous good.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, a State Department spokesperson said, \u201cThe United States supports like-minded nations working together to encourage the development of AI in line with our shared values. The US position in international bodies is to vigorously advocate for international AI governance approaches that promote innovation, reflect American values, and counter authoritarian influence.\u201d",
      "The comments rejecting collaborative efforts around AI governance stood in stark contrast to many of the initiatives being launched at the General Assembly.",
      "On Thursday, the U.N. introduced the Global Dialogue on AI Governance, the U.N.\u2019s first body dedicated to AI governance involving all member states. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the body would \u201clay the cornerstones of a global AI ecosystem that can keep pace with the fastest-moving technology in human history.\u201d Speaking after Guterres, Nobel Prize recipient Daron Acemoglu outlined the growing stakes of AI\u2019s rapid development, arguing that \u201cAI is the biggest threat that humanity has faced.\u201d",
      "But in an interview with NBC News, Amandeep Singh Gill, the U.N.\u2019s special envoy for digital and emerging technologies, said that the United States\u2019 critical perception of the U.N.\u2019s role in international AI governance was misconstrued.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation to say that the U.N. is somehow getting into the regulation of AI,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThese are not top-down power grabs in terms of regulation. The regulation stays where regulation can be done in sovereign jurisdictions.\u201d",
      "Instead, the U.N.\u2019s mechanisms \u201cwill provide platforms for international cooperation on AI governance,\u201d Gill said.",
      "In remarks immediately following Kratsios\u2019 comments, China\u2019s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ma Zhaoxu said, \u201cIt is vital to jointly foster an open, inclusive, fair and nondiscriminatory environment for technological development and firmly oppose unilateralism and protectionism.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe support the U.N. playing a central role in AI governance,\u201d Ma said.",
      "One day after Kratsios\u2019 remarks at the Security Council, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez seemed to push back on Kratsios and gave full-throated support for international cooperation on AI and the U.N.\u2019s role in AI governance.",
      "\u201cWe need to coordinate a shared vision of AI at a global level, with the U.N. as the legitimate and inclusive forum to forge consensus around common interests,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cThe time is now, when multilateralism is being most questioned and attacked, that we need to reaffirm how suitable it is in addressing challenges such as those represented by AI.\u201d",
      "Reacting to the week\u2019s developments, Renan Araujo, director of programs for the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for AI Policy and Strategy, told NBC News that \u201cno one wants to see a burdensome, bureaucratic governance structure, and the U.S. has succeeded in starting bilateral and minilateral coalitions. At the same time, we should expect AI-related challenges to become more transnational in nature as AI capabilities become more advanced.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time the U.N. has addressed AI, having passed the Global Digital Compact last year. The compact laid the foundation for the AI dialogue and for an independent international scientific panel to evaluate AI\u2019s abilities, risks and pathways forward. Guterres announced that nominations to this panel are now open.",
      "While Thursday\u2019s event marked the launch of the global dialogue and panel, the dialogue will have its first full meeting in Geneva in summer 2026, in tandem with the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s annual AI for Good summit. The dialogue\u2019s exact functions and first actions will be charted out over the coming months."

      "\u201cThis result further erodes separation of powers principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order. It will also have a grave humanitarian impact,\" said Nicolas Sansome, a lawyer with Public Citizen Litigation Group, which represents nonprofit groups that sued.",
      "The brief order noted that the government has made a \"sufficient showing\" that the groups that sued were barred from bringing the lawsuit in question under a law called the Impoundment Control Act.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, also noted that \"the asserted harms to the Executive\u2019s conduct of foreign affairs appear to outweigh the potential harm\" to the plaintiffs, which are various groups that receive foreign aid funds.",
      "The court has now granted 20 emergency applications filed by the administration since President Donald Trump\u2019s second term began in January. The volume of emergency filings and the rate at which the court has ruled in the administration's favor are both unprecedented. The latter has sparked criticism from within the legal community, including lower court judges.",
      "A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.",
      "The three liberals on the court dissented, with Justice Elena Kagan writing that the legal issue in the case has not been presented before, meaning the court was working in \"uncharted territory.\"",

      "\"We therefore should have denied this application, allowed the lower courts to go forward, and ensured that the weighty question presented here receives the consideration it deserves,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts had on Sept. 9 issued a temporary stay that put the lower court ruling on hold while the Supreme Court decided what next steps to take.",
      "The Trump administration, which has aggressively sought to exert its power over Congress in recent months, has notified lawmakers of its intention not to spend the funds.",
      "This action has sparked a debate over whether the president has such authority, as under the Constitution, it is the role of Congress to allocate money for the president to spend.",
      "After the Supreme Court decision, Democrats quickly urged Congress to reassert its authority to control spending even as lawmakers are engaged in a budget fight that could lead to a government shutdown.",
      "\"Republicans should join Democrats to stand up for our power of the purse,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa. and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. said in a joint statement.",
      "The Trump administration has already taken swift action to unravel the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government department that traditionally handed out billions of dollars a year in foreign aid to tackle such issues as access to water and disease prevention.",
      "The money at issue was appropriated by Congress for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. The Trump administration has said it wants to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, but will spend another $6.5 billion that Congress appropriated.",
      "The Impoundment Control Act was passed in 1974 to regulate the president\u2019s control over the budget. That followed efforts by then-President Richard Nixon to withhold spending on programs he did not support.",
      "The Trump administration says it can withhold the money via a process known as \"rescission,\" in which the president informs Congress of his intention not to spend certain funds.",
      "But with little time left before the funds expire, Congress is unlikely to respond, even if it wanted to. Republicans who broadly support Trump's policies control both chambers and are in the process of trying to fund the government for the next fiscal year before Oct. 1; otherwise, the government will shut down.",
      "The administration's decision to wait until the end of the fiscal year to notify Congress is a legally questionable tactic that has been called a \"pocket rescission\" and has not been used in nearly 50 years.",
      "Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali had ruled on Sept. 3 that the administration must spend the money unless Congress acts to withdraw it.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in a court filing that Ali's ruling imposed unacceptable restrictions on the president by, among other things, forcing the administration to engage in diplomatic discussions with other countries over how to spend the money",
      "The underlying lawsuit challenging Trump's rescission was brought by various groups led by the Global Health Council.",
      "Their lawyers said in court papers that the administration's legal arguments would turn the Impoundment Control Act on its head by reaching the conclusion that \"Congress\u2019s signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court.\""

      "Black liberation activist and American fugitive Assata Shakur, who escaped to Cuba more than 45 years ago after she was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper, died in Havana, the government announced Friday.",
      "She was 78.",
      "Shakur, who changed her name from Joanne Chesimard, died Thursday from health ailments and advanced age, according to a short statement released by the Cuban Foreign Ministry.",
      "\u201cWords cannot describe the depth of loss that I am feeling at this time. I want to thank you for your loving prayers,\u201d her daughter Kakuya Shakur wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "Shakur was involved in a shootout during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973. State Trooper Werner Foerster, the second officer responding to the scene, found a loaded gun on the driver of the car, according to previous NBC News reporting. Shakur was in the front passenger seat and another man was seated behind her.",
      "There was an exchange of gunfire. James Harper, the state trooper who initially pulled the group over, said he saw Shakur shoot Foerster in the stomach with the officer's gun after he tussled with the driver, who also shot Foerster in the arm.",
      "Shakur and two men she was with returned to the car and drove five miles down the New Jersey Turnpike. One of the men with them, James Coston, died in the car. As they dumped Coston's body on the side of the road, police caught up to the group. Shakur was arrested while the driver fled and was found nearly two days later.",
      "Shakur, who was sentenced to life in prison, denied shooting Foerster. To supporters, she was an activist jailed for crimes she did not commit.",
      "In a statement, Foerster's family said her death did not bring any joy to them, but did bring \"a measure of closure to a tragedy that has deeply affected our family and community.\"",
      "\"While this development marks the end of a long and painful chapter, it does not erase the profound loss we continue to feel each day,\" the family said. \"The pain of losing Werner is something we carry every single day. His absence is felt in every quiet moment, every family gathering, and every milestone he should have been here to witness.\"",
      "Shakur was born Joanne Deborah Byron in Queens, New York, on July 16, 1947. After what she described in her autobiography as a troubled childhood, she became involved in political activism at the Borough of Manhattan Community College and City College of New York. She was a member of the revolutionary Black Liberation Army, as well as the Black Panther Party. At 21, she married Louis Chesimard, though their marriage lasted only a year.",
      "Shakur was serving a life sentence at the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey after being convicted in 1977 of murder in Foerster's death. She had also been implicated in armed robbery and other crimes. She escaped from prison on Nov. 2, 1979, with the help of members of the Black Liberation Army who posed as visitors. She turned up a few years later in Cuba, where the island\u2019s leader at the time, Fidel Castro, granted her political asylum. She published an autobiography in 1987.",
      "Because Cuba repeatedly refused to extradite her to the U.S., Shakur and other fugitives living in Cuba became a major sticking point in negotiations between the U.S. and the communist-run island after President Barack Obama re-established diplomatic relations between the two countries.",
      "Then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Shakur should be returned to New Jersey after the ceremonial reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Cuba in 2015.",
      "Gov. Phil Murphy and state Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan said in a statement Friday that their offices have worked with the State Department in previous attempts to bring Shakur back to New Jersey to face accountability for Foerster's killing and for fleeing the country.",
      "\"We will vigorously oppose any attempt to repatriate Chesimard's remains to the United States,\" they wrote.",
      "Shakur became the first woman on the FBI\u2019s list of most wanted terrorists in 2013. She was added to the list on the anniversary of Foerster\u2019s death. There was a $2 million reward for information leading to her arrest.",
      "Supporters of Shakur, who was rapper Tupac Shakur's godmother through her brother Mutulu Shakur, believed she was a target of law enforcement for her involvement with the Black Liberation Army.",
      "In a 1998 interview with NBC New York in Havana, Shakur said she had never killed anyone and was found guilty in an \u201cunfair trial\u201d by an all-white jury.",
      "\u201cI was shot with my arms in the air, then shot again in the back and left on the ground to die,\u201d she said. \u201cNext thing I knew, they were coming by me and saying, \u2018Is she dead yet, is she dead yet?\u2019\u201d",
      "She said she was later taken to a hospital, where she was beaten and tortured by state troopers who she said would stick their hands in her wounds and ask if it hurt.",
      "\u201cAmerican racism has done to another Black person what it has done to Black people down through the years,\u201d Shakur\u2019s defense attorney William Kunstler said in 1977. \u201cThe reality is, this beautiful young Black woman never had a chance, but we, like liberal fools, still had hopes.\u201d"

Trump has said repeatedly since returning to office that he would like to resume diplomacy with Kim.",
      "Speaking in New York on Thursday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said North Korea appears to already have enough nuclear weapons for \u201cregime survival,\u201d and that it continues to produce nuclear material and develop ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the continental U.S.",
      "\u201cIt seems not to have succeeded yet, but only one final step remains \u2014 so-called atmospheric re-entry technology,\u201d Lee said at an investment summit at the New York Stock Exchange. \u201cThat, too, is likely to be solved soon.\u201d",

      "Instead, he said, the goal should be for North Korea to first freeze its nuclear weapons program, then reduce it and ultimately dismantle it.",
      "Achieving this will require Kim to negotiate with someone he trusts, and Trump \u201cis uniquely positioned to be that counterpart,\u201d Lee said.",

      "Kim has also deepened his country\u2019s military cooperation with Russia, sending artillery and thousands of troops to support President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "The North Korean regime now says the U.S. and others have no choice but to accept it as a nuclear weapons state.",
      "On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young said North Korea was operating a total of four uranium enrichment facilities, including the only declared site at Yongbyon, about 60 miles north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.",
      "Chung also said North Korea appeared to have sharply increased its stockpile of highly enriched uranium for use in building nuclear weapons.",

      "He has also dismissed Lee\u2019s overtures toward peace, including the   suspension of propaganda leaflet drops from the air and loudspeaker broadcasts along the border between the two Koreas, which technically remain at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.",
      "Lee\u2019s phased solution of exchange, normalization and denuclearization \u2014 known as \u201cEND\u201d \u2014 is a clear departure from the international community\u2019s previous approach of \u201cdenuclearization first,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, distinguished chair professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, South Korea.",

Abbas, as the head of the Palestinian Authority, has been at odds with Hamas since the Islamist militants won municipal elections and forced their more moderate rivals out of Gaza in 2007.",
      "The Palestinian Authority, which partly controls the occupied West Bank, was \u201cready to bear full responsibility for governance and security\u201d in the enclave, Abbas said.",
      "Speaking with Gulf foreign ministers Wednesday during the assembly, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: \u201cWe understand very clearly that the situation in Gaza, the situation with Israel and Gaza, is a key concern for everyone in this room here today.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want this conflict to end,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want it to end immediately.\u201d",
      "Rubio added that \u201csome very important work is ongoing, even as we speak, and hoping to achieve this as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s assurances to Arab leaders that he would not let Israel annex the West Bank came after right-wing members of Netanyahu\u2019s fragile government coalition called for the move as a string of countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Portugal formally recognized Palestine as a state.",
      "Palestinians envision the West Bank as a core territory for an internationally recognized Palestinian state, alongside Gaza and east Jerusalem. Annexation of the territory, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, would further imperil that cause.",
      "Netanyahu, who was traveling to New York on Thursday before addressing the General Assembly on Friday and meeting Trump next week, has declared that there will never be a Palestinian state under his watch.",
      "Trump told the U.N. this week that the recognition moves risked rewarding Hamas.",
      "Israel has already pushed ahead with a widely condemned settlement plan that would effectively split the West Bank in two, further fracturing what Palestinians envision as their future state.",
      "Deadly settler violence and Israeli military operations have also increased in the Palestinian territory.",
      "UAE leaders have said annexation of the West Bank would be a red line for the influential Gulf state, blocking any future recognition of Israel and preventing the completion of Trump\u2019s landmark Abraham Accords that sought to establish diplomatic normalization between Israel and several Arab states."

      "Microsoft has cut off some services to a unit in Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry after investigating allegations that it was using Microsoft cloud products for the mass surveillance of Palestinians.",
      "In a blog post published Thursday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said the move came after reviewing an Aug. 6 report from The Guardian that said an Israel Defense Forces intelligence unit had used the company\u2019s Azure storage service to collect and store recordings of Palestinian civilians\u2019 phone calls.",
      "Azure is Microsoft\u2019s primary cloud-computing service, with millions of monthly active users around the globe. However, the Guardian \u2014 citing interviews with 11 sources, including at Microsoft and among Israeli intelligence officials \u2014 alleged that the unit had access to \u201ca customised and segregated area\u201d within Azure\u2019s cloud platform.",
      "Smith did not directly corroborate that assertion but said the company\u2019s review had found evidence that \u201csupports elements of the Guardian\u2019s reporting,\u201d including the use of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and of certain artificial intelligence services. Smith did not provide additional details.",
      "Microsoft has since informed Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry, which oversees the IDF and its intelligence units, that it was disabling the unit\u2019s ability to use parts of Azure\u2019s cloud storage service. Microsoft did not name the unit it was targeting in its action, but The Guardian report was centered on Unit 8200, seen as Israel\u2019s equivalent to the U.S. National Security Agency. NBC News has not confirmed that report.",
      "\u201cWe do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades.\u201d",
      "Smith said Microsoft would continue other work designed to \u201cprotect the cybersecurity of Israel and other countries in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had no comment. In response to The Guardian\u2019s August report, an Israeli official first said its work with companies such as Microsoft was based on \u201clegally supervised agreements,\u201d but then later stated that \u201cMicrosoft is not and has not been working with the IDF on the storage or processing of data.\u201d",
      "The Guardian article was the latest in a yearslong series of media reports alleging that the IDF has been using software products created by U.S. tech giants, including Microsoft, in its war in the Gaza Strip. The reports have led to internal protests by Microsoft employees, some of whom have subsequently been terminated, according to documents reviewed by CNBC. Late last month, Microsoft said it asked police to remove people it said had improperly entered its headquarters as part of a protest action.",
      "Microsoft has said it doesn\u2019t retaliate against employees who express their views but would respond to anyone deemed to have made threats.",
      "The reports about the use of Microsoft products by Israel\u2019s military have helped fuel a protest group, No Tech for Apartheid, created in 2021, aimed at pressuring Silicon Valley businesses to cut ties with Israel. The group includes a Microsoft-focused offshoot, No Azure for Apartheid, that has focused on the Redmond, Washington-based corporation.",
      "In a statement, a representative for No Azure for Apartheid celebrated the announcement, calling it \u201csignificant and unprecedented,\u201d but noting that \u201cMicrosoft has only disabled a small subset of services to only one unit in the Israeli military. The vast majority of Microsoft\u2019s contract with the Israeli military remains intact.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign in response to Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks \u2014 which it has said killed approximately 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals and led to some 251 hostages being taken \u2014 has killed nearly 65,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A U.S. film distributor has criticized a Chinese studio for reportedly using artificial intelligence to make a gay couple straight when distributing the body-horror film \u201cTogether\u201d in China.",
      "Early this month, moviegoers who attended preview screenings said on Chinese social media that one of two men shown getting married in the film was digitally altered into a woman, most likely with AI.",
      "Neon, the film\u2019s global distributor, said Wednesday that it \u201cdoes not approve of\u201d the \u201cunauthorized\u201d edit of the film by Chengdu-based film distributor Hishow and that screenings of the altered version must be stopped, Deadline reported.",
      "Written and directed by Australian filmmaker Michael Shanks, the movie tells the story of a couple, played by American actors Alison Brie and Dave Franco, who move to the countryside to save their relationship and encounter a mysterious force that draws them closer.",
      "Hishow offered the first prerelease screenings in 11 Chinese cities starting Sept. 12, with the movie scheduled to be released nationwide on Sept. 19.",
      "Many early viewers took to social media to complain about the gender change.",
      "One user on Xiaohongshu, or RedNote, a Chinese platform similar to Instagram, described the AI alteration of the same-sex wedding as \u201coutrageous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe version shown in mainland China didn\u2019t delete this scene. Instead, it photoshopped a woman\u2019s face over one of the men,\u201d the person posted. \u201cIt looked quite reasonable. Even the American conservatives would be impressed!\u201d",
      "The state-owned China Film Group Corp. said last week that the wide release of \u201cTogether\u201d had been postponed due to \u201ca change in the film\u2019s distribution plan,\u201d without offering further details.",
      "\u201cThe specific new date will be announced once it is confirmed,\u201d it said.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Hishow and Neon for comment.",
      "Though imported films are often edited by Chinese censors to cut scenes deemed too sensitive or risqu\u00e9, this appears to be among the first instances of technology being used to change a scene instead.",
      "One of the biggest subjects of censorship is homosexuality, which despite being decriminalized in China has been the target of a government crackdown in recent years, even though surveys shows the public is increasingly supportive of LGBTQ people.",
      "In 2021, Chinese authorities banned \u201ceffeminate\u201d behavior from screens, and fans complained in 2022 when they noticed the removal of an LGBTQ storyline from the TV sitcom \u201cFriends,\u201d which is highly popular in China. At least 10 scenes with gay references were also dropped from the Chinese version of the 2018 biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d about the rock musician and Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.",
      "The alteration of the \u201cTogether\u201d wedding scene \u201csignifies that the government has a clear stance, and they have a red line,\u201d Jason Coe, who teaches courses on film and media studies at the University of Hong Kong, told NBC News. \u201cThey will look to enforce it, and they will find innovative ways to enforce it.\u201d",
      "Zeng Hong, an assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film, agreed that the apparent use of AI in \u201cTogether\u201d is not \u201clooking promising for LGBTQ rights as well as their representation on Chinese screens.\u201d",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time that artificial intelligence has been used to alter a film in Asia.",
      "Early last month, the hit 2013 Bollywood romantic drama \u201cRaanjhanaa\u201d was re-released in India with its ending altered by AI in what is believed to be a world first, setting off a debate about the future of storytelling in the country and beyond.",
      "The original version of the film ends with the death of a Hindu man who has a doomed romance with a Muslim woman. In the new version he lives, in what production house Eros International said was a \u201ccreative reinterpretation.\u201d",
      "The film\u2019s director, Aanand L. Rai, who was unaware of the changes, called the decision \u201cdeeply disrespectful.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo cloak a film\u2019s emotional legacy in a synthetic cape without consent, is not a creative act,\u201d Rai wrote in a post on Instagram. \u201cIt\u2019s an abject betrayal of everything we built.\u201d"
